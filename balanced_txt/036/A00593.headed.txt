Levium metallorum fructus in summo est: illa opulentissima sunt quorum in alto latet vena, assiduè pleniùs responsura fodienti.

TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTIE, CHARLES, BY THE GRACE OF GOD, KING OF GREAT BRITAINE, FRANCE, AND IRELAND, DEFENDER OF THE FAITH. Most gracious and dread Soveraigne, I Would not presume to present these crude conceptions and expressions to your High∣nesse, if I had not offered them before to an higher Majestie: in whose Courts, with how much the more feare and trembling I delivered them, so much the greater hope I conceive of your Majesties gracious ac∣ceptance. The Texts of Scriptures here expounded are all se∣lect, and most of them mysticall; in the declaration whereof, if my observations second not your Majesties thoughts, yet I perswade my selfe they will occasion more divine raptures in your royall heart. The Crocodiles which besiege the bankes of Nilus, and way-lay those that travell into Egypt,Caussinus pa∣rab. hist. l. 8. c. 31. Comper∣tum est Croco∣dilum impro∣bissimum ani∣mal, si penna Ibidis defrice∣tur, adeò ob∣torpescere & debilitari, ut immobilis red∣datur. if they be rubbed, or but pricked with the quill of the Ibis, are so weakened and stupified thereby, that they cannot stirre: and in like manner
experience teacheth, that the presentest remedies against those venemous Serpents which infest the Church of Christ, whe∣ther Heretickes or Schismatickes, are the pens of Orthodoxe Writers. For that which is spoken commeth but to a few that are within hearing, and stayeth not by them; but that which is written, and much more that which is printed, presenteth it selfe to the view of all, and is alwaies ready at hand: and as it receiveth, so it maketh an impression. Which consideration, a∣mong others, induced mee to give way to the desires of some friends, for the bringing of these illustrations of darker places of Scripture to light, especially because therein the proper He∣resies of these times are encountred, and the Doctrine and Di∣scipline of the Church of England maintained by the Oracles of God, and the joynt testimony of prime Antiquity. In this Worke I owne nothing but the labour of many moneths, nay rather yeeres, in culling choice of flowers out of many hundreds of gardens, and platting them into a garland for Christ his Spouse. From which I humbly beseech Almighty God, that your Majestie, and all that touch any leafe thereof, may smell a savour of life unto life. The price and worth in all things ma∣keth not the dedication; but in some the dedication maketh the price:Plin. praef. nat. hist. Multa in pretio habentur, quia sacris dicata. And if there appeare in these unpolished lines any lustre, it is no o∣ther than that they receive from the beames of your Majesties eye, if your Majestie vouchsafe a glaunce thereof on them: for which (as we are all otherwise most bound) I shall ever fixe my eyes and devotions on Heaven, and uncessantly pray for the continuance and encrease of your Majesties temporall, and assurance of eternall happinesse. Your Majesties most loyally and humbly devoted Subject, DANIEL FEATLEY.

THE BRUISED REED. A Sermon preached before his Grace, and the rest of his Majesties Commissioners in causes Ecclesiasticall, Decemb. 4. An. Dom. 1617. at Lambeth. THE FIRST SERMON. MATTH. 12. & 20. ex ESA. 42. & 3. A bruised reed shall hee not breake, and smoaking flaxe shall hee not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory, or (as we reade in Esay) hee shall bring forth judgement unto truth. Most REVEREND, &c. I Would not presume to found a bruised Reed, or winde a crack't Pipe in this place, destinated and appointed for the silver Trumpets of Sion; nor blow my smoaking Flaxe here, where the cleerest Lights of the Sanctua∣ry usually shine, if the Text of Scripture, even now read in your eares, encouraged mee not thereunto, teaching the strongest and tallest Cedars of Lebanon, by the example of the Highest, not to fall upon, and breake the bruised Reed: and likewise the brightest burning Lampes of the Church not to do ut, and quench the smoaking, or (as the Hebrew beares it) the dimly burning Flaxe of their brethrens obscurer parts and labours. A bruised Reed, &c. Whether by bruised Reed, with S. Gregory, we understand the broken Scepter of the Jewish Kingdome; and by smoaking Flaxe, the Aaronicall Priesthood, destitute of the light of Faith, and now ready to goe out and expire; or by Arundinem conquassatam, the shaken Reed (as S. Hierome reades the words) wee conceive the wavering faith of the Jewes to bee meant; and by the smoaking Flaxe, the momentary fervour of the Gen∣tiles,
which is Tertullians exposition, seconded by Rhemigius: or we take the bruised Reeds in Saint Hilaries construction for the maimed bodies of such as were brought to Christ; and smoaking Flaxe, for their troubled mindes and distressed consciences: or we be carried with the maine current of later Interpreters, who are all strongly for all penitent sinners oppressed with the heavie burden of their sinnes, and stricken with the horrour of Gods judgements, in whom there remaines any sparke of grace, to be sha∣dowed under the Metaphors of the bruised Reed and smoaking Flaxe. Vox diversa sonat doctorum, est vox tamen una. The descant is somewhat different, the ground is the same; all warbling the sweet note of our Redeemers most gracious and mercifull disposition, who was so meek in his speeches, that hee never strained his voice to ex∣claime bitterly, and inveigh vehemently against any; Ver. 19. He shall not cry, nor lift up his voice: and so milde and altogether innocent in his acti∣ons, that he never brake so much as a bruised Reed, nor trode out a smothe∣ring Week, or smoaking Flaxe. To cleere then the meaning of this Scripture from all mists of obscuri∣ty, arising from variety of Interpretations, give mee leave, as it were, to melt many small waxe lights into a great Taper, by a generall Paraphrase upon the words. Hee, that is, Jesus, the second person in Trinity, our Me∣diatour and Saviour (as S. Matthew, by applying this Prophecy unto him, consequently expoundeth it) Shall or will not breake , that is, destroy or cast away a bruised Reed or Cane, , that is, an afflicted and contrite sinner, be he Prince or Priest, in Saint Gregories sense; Jew or Gentile, according to Tertullians interpretation; afflicted in body or in minde, agreeable to S. Hilaries exposition. And smoaking flaxe he shall or will not quench, that is, hee will not dis∣hearten or discourage any Puny or Novice in his Schoole; but on the con∣trary he will cherish the smallest seeds of grace, and weake beginnings in new converts: neither will he take away his Spirit from any relapsed and languishing Christian, exhaling bitter and darke fumes of sighes for his sinnes, if there remaine any light of faith in him, though never so obscure: any heat of true zeale and devotion, though very weake, and scarce sensi∣ble. Behold here then store and aboundance of the Balme of Gilead, drop∣ping from this sweet Cane in my Text. A Reed; what so weak? and that bruised; what so unprofitable? yet shall not be broken: And Flaxe, or the weeke of a lampe or candle; what so vile? and that smoaking; what so loathsome? yet shall not be quenched. By this cursory interpretation and illustration of the words you may easily distinguish in them, 1. Two members of this Propheticall sen∣tence. A bruised, &c. A smoaking, &c. 2. Two subjects answerable to the two members. Reed, Flaxe. 3. Two attributes proper to these sub∣jects. Bruising, Smoaking. 4. Two acts sutable to these attri∣butes. Breake, Quench.
both removed from, and denied of Christ, he shall not breake, he shall not quench. Of these, by the concurrence of Gods assistance, with your pati∣ence, now and hereafter, according to the order of the words in the origi∣nall: A reed bruised he shall not breake. A reed. Although the reed in my Text may seeme hollow, and conse∣quently empty of matter fit for our use; yet if you please to look narrow∣ly into it, you shall finde it like that precious staffe which Brutus offered to Apollo, in the hollow whereof much massie gold was inclosed.Cujus intus so∣lidum autum corneo velaba∣tur cortice. Liv. Dec. Pri. l. 2. To open this horne or cane, that wee may finde the treasure hid in it, may it please you to take notice of a foure-fold Reed described in holy Scriptures: 1. Mysticall. 2. Artificiall. 3. Naturall. 4. Morall. Of the Mysticall you have heard already out of the Fathers. The Arti∣ficiall reed is a golden instrument to mete withall, mentioned, Ezek. 40.5. Apoc. 21.15. I need not speake of the Naturall reed,And he that tal∣ked with me, had a golden reed to measure the City. it is so well knowne to be a watery plant, or tree, wherewith nature fenceth the bankes of ri∣vers and brookes, placing them thicke about the flagges, as it were so many pikes in an Army about the ensignes or streamers.Plin. hist. nat. l. 16. c. 36. Calamis orien∣tis populi bella conficiunt, ca∣lamis spicula addunt irrevo∣cabili hamo noxia, his ar∣mis Solem ip∣sum obscurant. The great Naturalist setteth forth this plant in the richest colours of Rhetoricke, out of a kinde of gratitude, as being indebted to it for his pen and pensill, which were an∣ciently made of canes, as now of quils. The people of the East use reeds in their wars, of these they make deadly darts, these they wing with feathers, and they let them flye in such aboundance, that they over-shadow the Sunne. To these reeds the ProphetEsay 19.6. Esay pointeth: The reeds and flagges shall wi∣ther. But our SaviourMatth. 11.7. evidently alludeth to a Morall reed: What went you out into the wildernesse to see? a Reed shaken with the wind? that is, a timorous and inconstant man. No, John was no such reed, hee was not light nor unstable, nor must we be,Apoc. 3.12. if wee expect one day to bee made pillars in the Temple of God. Of these foure kindes of reeds, which sorteth best with the meaning of this Scripture? the Artificiall cannot bee here meant; for that's a perfect straight cane: but this a bowed or bruised.Maldon. In hunc locum adeò quierè & attentè ambu∣labit, ut etiamsi super arundi∣nem jam quas∣satam, qua ni∣hil fragilius esse potest, pe∣dem poneret, eam non con∣fringeret. Maldonat glaunceth at the Naturall, and thus (as he imagineth) hitteth the sense: He will tread so wa∣rily and lightly, that if a bruised reed were under his feet, he would not breake it, or crush it in pieces. But St.Hieron. Per calamum quas∣satum & con∣tusum intelli∣git populum Judicum, qui anteà vocalis & sonorus laudes Deo concinebat, posteà impingens in angularem lapidem, meritò appellatur calamus fractus, pertundens manum ejus qui illi voluerit inniti. Hierome sweetly playeth upon the My∣sticall reed: By the shaken and bruised reed, saith hee, the Evangelist under∣standeth the people of the Jewes, which in former time were sound and entire, and sweetly sounded out the praises of God; but now falling upon the corner stone, were cracked: and therefore are fitly termed a bruised reed, running into their hands who leane upon it. AndGorrh. in Matth. 12. Uebantur exterius literali Legis observantia, sed vacui erant interius spirituali intelligentia. Gorrhan addeth, that the Jewish people might in this also be com∣pared to reeds, that they stucke to the letter of the Law, and were inwardly hollow, that is, empty of the spirituall sense and meaning. Yet the same SaintHieron. Qui peccatori non porrigit manum, nec portatonus fratris sui, iste ca∣lamum quassatum confringit. Jerome in his Commentaries upon St. Matthew, understandeth Reed in my Text morally, taking it for a fraile and weake man, whereof what fitter
embleme can be devised than a reed? 1. A reed hollow within, and man by nature empty and void of all inward grace. 2. A reed apt to make a pipe to sound, or cane to write; and man likewise fitted with a tongue to sound out, and a hand to write his Makers praises. 3. A reed dry or unfruitfull, though planted and growing by the river side; and man dry and unfruitfull in good workes, though continually watered with the dew of Gods bles∣sings. 4. A reed ever wagging of it selfe, or shaken, and man so unstable, that Plato defines him , a changeable creature. 5. A reed so weake, that it yeeldeth to the least puffe of winde, and is blowne downe to the ground with a violent blast; and man so feeble, that hee is moved with the least blast of temptation, and if it grow more violent, is not only shaken, but quite bowed and bruised by it, as this in my Text. Bruised. A reed, as I have shewed, is an embleme of fraile man; but a bruised reed seemeth to mee a proper embleme of a Christian: the Motto or word you have in John the 16.Ver. 33. In mundo pressuram habebitis: In the world you shall have, word for word, bruising, that is, grievances, and brui∣ses, or pressures, some inward, some outward, some in the body, some in the soule, some from the yoke of Tyrants, some from the burthen of your sinnes,Aust. Serm. de temp. some from the weight of Gods judgements. Whereunto S. Austin sweetly alluding, saith, The fairest and ripest grapes are pressed, that they may yeeld their sweetest juice. The hint of which conceit he may seeme to have taken from Saint Cyprian:Cypr. ep. ad Mart. Vos de vinea domini pingues racemi, & jam maturi fructi∣bus botri pres∣sure secularis infestatione calcatae, torcu∣lar vestium carcere tot quente sentitis, vini vice san∣guinem fundi∣tis. Yee are goodly branches of the true Vine, hang'd with clusters of ripe grapes; secular persecution is your treading upon and pressing, your wine-presse is the prison, and in stead of wine, your bloud is drawne from you. The hony-combes are pressed and bruised, to squeeze out of them the thickest hony; the ripe and full eares are smitten and brui∣sed with the flaile, to beat the corne out of them: the rich Ore is beat and bruised in the stamping mils, and afterwards tried by fire, before there come of it precious and pure metall: the corne is bruised and ground to make flowre. Whereunto the blessed MartyrHier in catal. Christi fru∣mentum sum, dentibus bellu∣arum molar, ut panis mundus inveniar. Ignatius fitly resembling the death whereby he was then to glorifie God, when hee heard the hungry Lyons roaring for their prey, and gaping wide to devoure him, said, I am Christs corne, and straight-waies shall be ground with the teeth of beasts, that I may be served in as fine manchet at his table in heaven. When the hottest spices are bruised and brayed in the mortar, they yeeld a most fragrant smell; and a boxe of oyntment, after that it is broken, sweetly perfumeth the whole roome: Even so those prayers and meditations are most fervent and fragrant in the nostrils of Almighty God, which rise from a bruised spirit, and a broken and contrite heart, through inward and outward afflicti∣on. It is the proper evill and (if I may so speake) misery of earthly hap∣pinesse, that it maketh the heart fat, and dulleth and deadeth the spirits of zeale and devotion: and contrariwise, it is a kinde of happinesse which misery bringeth,Hos. 5.15. In their affliction they will seeke mee early. that it quickens us, and maketh us seeke diligently after God. In their affliction they will seeke meOr early, Hos. 5.15. diligently. When by any grievous fit of sicknesse, or great losse, or sore wound in our reputation, wee are touched to the quicke, then we begin to be sensible of our own infirmities, and compassionate of other mens calamities; then we offer up prayers with
strong cryes; then, like bowed and bruised reeds, we fall flat downe to the ground, then our hearts swell with griefe, and our eyes are bigge with teares, and if Gods hand lye very heavie and long upon us, wee bid defi∣ance to all worldly pleasures and comforts, which faile us in our greatest extremity: we grow weary of this life, and in our desires run to meet death the halfe way, and sigh, and mourn, and pine away till we be quite dissolved, that we may be with Christ. In regard of these and such like wholsome fruits, which meeknesse and patience gather from the crosse, I dare undertake to make good that seeming Paradox of Demetrius concerning evils, Nihil eo infoelicius, cui nihil infoelix contigit; None is so miserable as hee who in this life never tasted any misery: For, besides that continuall pleasures glut his senses, and his very happinesse cloyeth him, hee wanteth many im∣provements of his wisedome, many trials of his faith,Apoc. 3.19. Prov. 3.12. Heb. 12.5. many exercises of his patience, many incentives of his zeale, many preservatives against sin; and, which weigheth all downe, many arguments of Gods love towards him, and care over him. If the Schoolmasters eye bee alwaies upon his Schollar to observe him, if hee still checke and correct him for his faults, it is a signe he beareth a singular affection to him, and hath a speciall care o∣ver him; but if he let him loyter and play the trewant, and abuse his fel∣lowes, and never call him to an account for it, it is evident thereby, that he intendeth to leave, or hath already left the tuition of him. In like manner, whiles the Physician prescribes to his patient unpleasing diet and bitter potions, and is ever trying some medicine or other upon him, the friends of the sicke are in good hope; but when the Physician leaves prescribing physicke, and forbids his patient nothing that he hath a mind unto, though hee grow still worse and worse, then all that are about him take on grie∣vously, and shed teares in secret, as knowing well that their friend is given over by the Doctor for desperate. Which Saint Bernard seriously con∣sidering, delivereth this strange, yet most true Aphorisme, Illi verè irascitur Deus, cui non irascitur: God is angry indeed with him,Quem enim in presenti non emendat, in fu∣turo condem∣nat. to whom hee showes it not by rebuking and chastening him for his sinne. For whom hee mends not by chastening in this world, hee certainly purpo∣seth to condemne in the other: This is a ruled case in Divinity, Dives is a president for it. If things stand thus in this world, let no Christian flatter himselfe with a vaine hope of uninterrupted prosperity, and unmixed joyes in this life: Invicem cedunt dolor & voluptas, pleasures and sorrowes have their turns; as sorrowes end in joyes, so joyes in sorrowes. There is a cup of trem∣bling which cannot passe, but first or last we must taste of it: & sith we must; let us looke for it, and when it comes to us, chearfully off with it; the ra∣ther, because our Lord and Saviour hath begun in it deep unto us. O yee Favourites, and (if I may so speake) Minions of Fortune, who are driven with a prosperous gale, and beare a lofty saile, swelling with the pride of a high minde, strike saile in time, looke soone for a bit∣terHieron. ad He∣lod. Licet in modum stagni fusum aequor arrideat, licet vix summa ja∣centis ele∣menti spiritu terga crispen∣tur, magnos hic campus mon∣tes haber, tranquillitas ista tempestas est. storme: Though the smooth sea smile upon thee, and seeme to bee no other than a standing poole, though the top of the water by the wind bee not so much as cast into bubbles, like the curles of thy haire, trust not the deep; the plaine thou seest hath many mountaines in it,
the present calme will prove in the end a tempest: or else assure thy self thou sailest not in Christs ship; for that was tossed in the sea, and even covered with waves,Matth. 8.24. yet not drowned: Jactatur, nunquam mergitur ista ratis. How should the ship be drowned or cast away upon the rockes, wherein Christ is the Pilot, the Scripture the Card, his Crosse the maine Mast, his promises,Matth. 28.20 Matth. 16.18. (I will be with you to the end of the world, and, Hell gates shall not prevaile against it) the Anchors, his holy Spirit the Wind? This maketh the Church bold, not onely to checke and represse the insolency of her ene∣mies,Micah 7.8. saying, Rejoyce not against me, O mine enemy, though I fall I shall rise; when I sit in darknesse, the Lord shall be a light unto me: but also glory in the Lord,Psal. 129.1. and insult over them, saying, Many a time have they afflicted mee from my youth up,Rom. 8.37. but they have not prevailed against me: Nay, In all things we are more than Conquerours, through him that loved us. David often har∣peth upon this sweet string,Psal. 118.18. The Lord hath chastened mee sore, but hee hath not given me over unto death:Psal. 37.24. the righteous falleth, yet shall not be utterly cast downe. What an excellent harmony doth St. Paul make of seeming dis∣cords!2 Cor. 4 8 9. , Wee are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not altogether without meanes; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast downe, but not destroyed: that is (to set the Prophets ditty to the Apostles tune) Wee are continually bruised, yet not broken. Hee shall not breake. I fore-see what you may object, That many of Gods servants, and Christs souldiers have had their flesh torn with whips, their joynts hewen asunder, their bones broken on the racke, and sometimes ground to pow∣der with the teeth of wilde beasts; nay, their whole body burnt to ashes, and these ashes cast into the river:Fox in Martyrol. Crispine Htor. Wald Aeneas S de gilt. Concil. Basil. how say we then, the bruised reed is ne∣ver broken, nor the smoaking flaxe quenched? For this blow we have a foure-fold ward: 1. We are to understand, that Gods promises of delivering his Saints are principally and simply to be taken of their eternall deliverance; but of tem∣porall secondarily, and conditionally, as it standeth with his glory, and their greater good. 2. We are to note, that many of the promises above mentioned concern the entire body of the Church, not every particular member. The bruised reed may be broken in some part, yet not through the whole: Tyrants may waste and destroy the Church partially, but not totally, for the reasons in∣timated by Tertullian and S. Leo,Tertulan apolog. Sanguis Mar∣tyrum semen Evangelii. Leo serm. Grana quae singula cadunt multi∣plicata nascun∣tut. because the bloud of Martyrs spilt upon the ground is like spirituall seed, from whence spring up new Martyrs: and the graines of corne which fall one by one, and die in the earth, rise up again in great numbers. Persecution serveth the Church in such stead, as pruning doth the Vine, whereby her branches shoot forth farther, and beare more fruit. Therefore S. Hierome excellently compareth the militant Church, burning still in some part in the heat of persecution, and yet flourishing, to the bush in Exodus,Exod 3.2. out of which Gods glory shined to Moses, which bur∣ned, yet consumed not. 3. Wee are to distinguish between corporall and spirituall destruction: Though the cane be crushed to peeces, yet the aire in the hollow of it is
not hurt; though the tree be hewen, the beame of the Sun shining upon it is not cut or parted in sunder. Feare not them, saith our Saviour,Matth. 10.28. which can kill the body, but are not able to kill the soule. Could the Philosopher say, tun∣dis vasculum: Anaxarchi, non Anaxarchum, Thou beatest the vessel, or strikest the coffin of Anaxarchus, not Anaxarchus himselfe, O Tyrant? Shall not a Christian with better reason say to his tormentors, Yee breake the boxe, ye spill not any of the oyntment; ye violate the casket, ye touch not the jewell? neither have yee so much power as utterly and perpetually to de∣stroy the casket (viz.) my body; for though it be beat to dust, and ground to powder, yet shall it be set together againe, and raised up at the last day,Philip. 3.21. and made conformable to Christs glorious body by the power of God, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himselfe. 4. And lastly, it is not here said simply the bruised reed shall not be bro∣ken, but shall not be broken by him, He shall not breake the bruised reed. He shall not breake: for hee came not to destroy, but to save;Luk 9.56. Esay 53.4. Mat. 27.30. And they took a reed and smote him on the head. not to bur∣then, but to ease; not to lay load upon us, but to carry all our sorrowes; not to breake the bruised reed, but rather to have reeds broken upon him, where∣with he was smote.Plin. nat. hist. l. 11. Icti à scor∣bionibus nun∣quam postea à crabronibus, vespis, apibusve feriuntur. Pliny observeth, that those that are strucken by Scor∣pions, are ever after priviledged from the stings of Waspes or Bees. The beasts that were torne or hurt by any accident, might not bee sacrificed or eaten. It is more than enough to bee once or singly miserable: whereupon he in the Greeke Poet passionately pleades against further molestation, . For Gods sake disease not a diseased man, presse not a dying man with more weight. Which because the enemies of David had the hard hearts to doe, he most bitterly cursed them: Poure out thine indignation upon them,Psal. 69.24, 25, 26. and let thy wrathfull anger take hold of them; let their habitation be desolate, and let none dwell in their tents: for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten, and talke to the griefe of those whom thou hast wounded. O how grievously doth S. Cyprian complaine against the inhumane cruelty of the persecutors of Christians in his time, who laid stripes upon stripes,Cypr. epist. ad Mart. In servis Dei non tor∣quebantur membra, sed vulnera. and inflicted wounds upon sores, and tortured not so much the members of Gods servants, as their bleeding wounds! Verily for this cause alone God commanded, that the name ofExod. 17.14. Amaleck should be blotted out from under heaven, because they met Israel by the way when they were faint, and smote the feeble among them. For not to comfort the afflicted, not to help a man that is hurt, not to seeke to hold life in one that is swouning, is inhumanity; but contrarily, to afflict the afflicted, to hurt the wounded, to trouble the grieved in spirit,Cic. pro Celio. sua sponte ca∣dentem maturiùs extinguere vulnere, to strike the breath out of a mans bo∣dy who is giving up the ghost, to breake a reed already bruised, to insult upon a condemned man, to vexe him that is broken in heart, and adde sor∣row to sorrow, Oh this is cruelty upon cruelty; farre be it from any Chri∣stian to practise it, and yet further from his thoughts, to cast any such a∣spersion upon the Father of mercy. How should the God of all consolation drive any poore soule to desperation? hee that will not breake a bruised reed, will he despise a broken heart? He that will not quench the smoaking flaxe, will he quench his Spirit, and tread out the sparkes of his grace in our soules? No, no, his Father sealed to him another commission,Esay 61.1. to preach
good tidings to the meeke,Luk. 4.18. to binde up the broken hearted, to set at liber∣ty them that are bruised, to give unto them that mourne in Sion beauty for ashes, the oyle of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heavinesse. And accordingly hee sent by his Prophet a comfortable mes∣sage to the daughter of Sion,Matth. ex Zach. Tell her, behold the King commeth unto thee meeke, and riding upon an Asse: a bruised reed he shall not breake, hee did not breake; and smoaking flaxe hee shall not quench, hee did not quench. Was not Peter a bruised reed when hee fell upon the rocke of offence, and thrice denied his Master, and went out and wept bitterly? Was not Paul like smoaking flaxe in the worst sense, when he breathed out threats against the Church, and sought by all violent meanes to smother the new light of the Gospel? yet we all see what a burning and shining lampe Christ hath made of this smoaking flaxe: what a noble cane to write the everlasting mercies of God to all posterity he hath made of the other, a bruised reed: But what speake I of bruised reeds not broken? the Jewes that crucified the Lord of life, the Roman souldier that pierced his side, were liker sharp pointed darts than bruised reeds; yet some of these were saved from brea∣king. Such is the vertue of the bloud of our Redeemer, that it cleansed their hands that were imbrued in the effusion thereof, if they afterward touch it by faith: so infinite is the value of his death, that it was a satis∣faction even for them who were authors of it, and saved some of the mur∣therers of their Saviour, as St.Cypr. epist. Vi∣vificatur Chri∣sti sanguine eti∣am qui effudit sanguinem Christi. Cyprian most comfortably deduceth out of the second of the Acts: They are quickned by Christs bloud who spilt it. Well therefore might St.Bern. Quid tam ad mor∣tem, quod non Christi morte sanetur. Bernard demand, What is so deadly which Christs death cannot heale? Comfort then, O comfort the fainting spirits, and strengthen the feeble knees, revive the spirit of the humble, raise up the prostrate and dejected soule. Be of good cheere ye that have received the sentence of death in your selves. There is no malady of the soule so deadly, against which the death of Christ is not a soveraigne remedy; there is no sore so great nor so festering, which a plaster of Christs bloud will not cleanse and heale, if it be thereto applyed by a lively faith. Thus, as you see, I have made of the bruised reed a staffe of comfort for a drouping conscience to stay it selfe upon; extend but your patience to the length of the houre, and I will make of it a strait rule for your actions and affections. Though all the actions of our Saviour are beyond example, yet ought they to be examples to us for our imitation; and though we can ne∣ver overtake him, yet we ought to follow after him. His life is a perfect samplar of all vertues, out of which if we ought to take any flower, espe∣cially this of meeknesse, which himselfe hath pricked out for us, saying, Learne of me that I am meeke and lowly in heart,Matth. 11.29. and you shall finde rest to your soules, which also hee richly setteth forth with a title of blessednesse over it,Matth. 5.5. and a large promise of great possessions by it; Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth:Matth. 5.7. Blessed are the mercifull, for they shall ob∣taine mercy. Neither is this vertue more acceptable in the sight of God, than agreeable to the nature of man. Witnesse our sleek and soft skin with∣out scales or roughnesse; witnesse our harmlesse members without hornes, clawes, or stings, the offensive weapons of other creatures; witnesse our tender and relenting heart, apt to receive the least impression of griefe;
witnesse our moist eyes, ready to shed teares upon any sad accident: —mollissima corda Humano generi dare se natura fatetur, Quae lachrymas dedit, haec nostri pars optima sensus. Shall not grace imprint that vertue in our soules, which nature hath ex∣pressed in the chiefe members of our bodies, and exemplified in the best creatures almost in every kind? Even among beasts, the tamest and gen∣tlest are the best; the master Bee either hath no sting at all, or (as Aristotle testifieth) never useth it. The upper region of the ayre is alwaies calme and quiet, inferiora fulminant, saith Seneca, men of baser and inferiour na∣tures are boysterous and tempestuous: The superiour spheres move regularly, and uniformly, and the first mover of them all is slow in his proceedings against rebellious sinners; hee was longer in destroying Jericho, than in creating the whole world. And when Adam and Eve had sinned with a high hand, reaching the forbidden fruit, and eating it, it was the coole of the evening before the voice of the Lord was heard in the garden, and the voice that was heard, was of God walking, not running: to verifie those many attributes of God, Mercifull, gracious, long-suffering,Exod. 34.6, 7. and aboundant in goodnesse and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sinne. Is God mercifull, and shall man be cruell? is the master meek and milde, and shall the servant be fierce and furious? shall hee give the Lambe in his Scutchion, and they the Lion? If hee who ruleth the Nations with a rod of iron, and breaketh them in pieces like a potters vessell, will not breake the bruised reed, shall reeds breake reeds?Martial. Epigr. The Heathen Poet giving charge to his woodden god to looke to his garden, useth this commination, See thou looke well to my trees, Alioqui & ipse lignum es, Otherwaies know that thou art wood thy selfe, that is, fit fuell for the fire. Suffer, I beseech you, the word of exhortation; Looke to it that you breake not Christs bruised reeds, Alioqui & ipsi estis arundines, Otherwaies know that you your selves are but reeds, and what measure you mete unto others, shall be mea∣sured unto you againe.

Vae lauda∣bili vitae homi∣num, si remot â misericordiâ di∣scutias cam. Wo be to the commendable life of men, if it bee searcht into without mercy, and scann'd exactly. The Cherubins themselves conti∣nually looke towards the Mercy-seat: and if we expect mercy at the hands of God or man, we must show mercy; for there shall be judgement without mercy, to him that will shew no mercy: which menacing to the unmercifull, though it point to the last judgement, and then take it's full effect, yet to deterre men from this unnaturall sinne against their owne bowels, it plea∣seth God sometimes in this life to make even reckonings with hard hearted men, and void of all compassion. As he did with Appius,Livius dec. 1. of whom Livie re∣porteth, that he was a great oppressor of the liberties of the commons, and particularly that hee tooke away all appeales to the people in case of life and death. But see how Justice revenged Mercies quarrell upon this unmercifull man; soone after this his decree, hee being called in question for forcing the wife of Virginius, he found all the Bench of Judges against him, and was constrained for saving his life to preferre an appeale to the people, which was denied him with great shouts and out-cries of all, say∣ing,
Ecce provocat, qui provocationem sustulit; who sees not the hand of di∣vine Justice herein? He is forced to appeale, who by barring all appeales in case of life and death, was the death of many a man. Let his owne measure be returned upon him. And as Appius was denied the benefit of appeales, whereof he deprived others, and immediatly felt the stroke of justice; so Eutropius, who gave the Emperour counsell to shut up all Sanctuaries a∣gainst capitall offenders, afterwards being pursued himselfe for his life, and flying to a Sanctuary for refuge, was from thence drawne out by the com∣mand of S. Chrysostome, and delivered to the ministers of justice, who made him feele the smart of his owne pernicious counsell. I need the lesse speake for mercy, by how much the more wee all need it: and therefore I passe from the act to the proper subject of mercy, The bruised reed. IfSen. de cle. l. 1. Tam omnibus ignoscere cru∣delitas est quam nulli. Jude ver. 22. mercy should be shewed unto all men, no place would be left for justice; therefore St. Jude restraineth mercy to some, Of some have compassion, ma∣king a difference. The difference we are to make is of 1. Sinne. 2. Sinners. For there are sinnes of ignorance, and sinnes against conscience; sinnes of infirmity, and sinnes of presumption; sudden passions, and deliberate evill actions; light staines, and fowle spots: some sinnes are secret and private, others publike and scandalous; some silent, others crying; some prejudi∣ciall only to the delinquent, others pernicious to the Church and Com∣mon-wealth. For the former, mercy often intercedeth, seldome or never for the latter. Againe, some offenders are likeEras. Adag. . heart of oake; which many strong blowes of an axe will scarce enter; others like the Balsamum of Judea, which you kill if youPlin. nat. hist. l. 12. c. 25.

The former resemble the Adamant, which can bee cut or pointed by nothing but an Adamant; the latter theSolinus c 40. tit Euphrates. Pyrrhites tene∣ri se vehemen∣tiu, non per∣mittit ac si quando arctio∣re manu pre∣mitur, digitos adurit. Pyrrhite, a pre∣cious stone, which may be gently ground or cut with a sharpe toole, but if you presse it hard, or handle it rudely, it burneth the fingers. For the lat∣ter mercy sometimes intercedeth, not so for the former. Lastly, after the offence committed, some are like bruised reeds, falling downe upon the earth, and imploring mercy: Others like a stiffe or strait cane, never so much as bowing; some stand in defence of that they have done, others ingenu∣ously confesse their fault; some glory in their sinne, others are confounded with it: in a word, some are obstinate, some are penitent; those mercy dis∣claimeth, these shee often taketh to her protection. They who in former times like pipes of reeds have sweetly sounded out the praises of God, but now are cracked with some pardonable errour in judgement, or slip in man∣ners, if they be truely bruised with the weight of their sinne, and through∣ly contrite, may plead the priviledge of the bruised reed in my Text, not to bee broken by any over hard and severe censure or sentence, not the Atheisticall scoffer, not the impudent Adulterer, not the obstinate Recu∣sant, not Jesuited Papists, which like the Egyptian reeds mentioned by the Prophet, runEsa. 36.6. Thou trustest in the staffe of this bro∣ken reed, on E∣gypt, whereon if a man leane, it will goe into his hand, and pierce it. into the hands and sides even ofJaques Cle∣ment, and Rai∣liac, who murde∣red two late Frenh Kings, Henr. 3. & 4. See Pierre Matthew, and other French Historians. Kings and Princes. They who have formerly shined before their brethren, both in their pure doctrine
and good example, though now by the violent blast of some fearfull temp∣tation, are blowne out as it were, and send up bitter fumes of sorrowfull lamentations for their sinfull iniquity or impurity, in some cases are not to be quenched; what therefore are not hereticall apostataes, and schismaticall boutefieus and fire-brands of Church and State, not to bee quenched and trode out, which if they be not quenched in time, will set all in a combusti∣on in the end? To conclude, as I began, with the words of my Text; it is the bruised reed that is not to be broken, not the poysoned dart; it is the smoaking flaxe that is not to be quenched, not the burning match. A bruised reed he shall not breake. Behold in the reed your frailty, in the bruised reed your condi∣tion; in the not breaking the bruised reed, a singular rule for your directi∣on, of which I spake but now, and a strong staffe of comfort, of which before. God grant that wee may all acknowledge our frailty, as being no other than reeds, and to arme our selves with patience against manifold pressures and tribulations, as being reeds that are or shall bee bruised; and when wee are afflicted or oppressed, not to despaire of helpe and ease, but to trust in Gods mercy, and hope for a joyfull deliverance, as bruised reeds that yet are not to be broken: and lastly, expecting mercy for our selves, shew mercy with discretion unto others, as being reeds, therefore not broken, that we may learne by the example of our Lord and Master not to break the bruised reed. To whom, &c.
THE SMOAKING FLAXE. A Sermon preached at Lambeth before his Grace, the Lord Bishop of London, and other his Majesties Commissioners in causes Ecclesiasticall, Decemb. 5. 1618. THE SECOND SERMON. MAT. 12. & 20. ESAY 42. & 3. And smoaking Flaxe shall he not quench. Most REVEREND, &c. THe sweet temper, and gracious disposition of our bles∣sed Redeemer, is as the sap in the root, which conveyeth life to the two branches of this Scripture. For by it the dy and bruised reed is nourished, as with moisture sup∣plyed; and the smoaking flaxe and dying lampe is refre∣shed, as it were with oyle: That, he will not break, this, he will not quench. Luk. 4.18.He, who came to heale the broken hearted, and set at liberty them that are bruised, will not breake the bruised reed. Hee, who was sent to give light to them that sit in darknesse,Luk. 1.79. . ita 70 Interp. Esay 53 4. and in the shadow of death, will not quench the smoaking flaxe, or dimly burning weeke. He, who bare all our infirmities, and carried our sorrowes, will not lay too heavie a burthen upon those that are truely humbled, but will so lightly passe over their sinnes, that he will not breake or crush in pieces the bruised reed, nor tread out the smoaking flaxe. This Text speaketh peace and much comfort, yet not to all, but to the contrite soule only.Matth. 27.30. The bruised and soft reed shall not be broken, but the stiffe and hard reed, like that wherewith Christ was smitten, shall be bro∣ken. They who after their sinnes committed relent not at all, they who are not troubled in conscience, nor crushed with feare of judgement, but stand in justification of their sinnes, and excuse their prophane sports on the Lords day, saying, they use but lawfull recreations, and their defiling the flesh, by pretending that it is but a tricke of youth, and their drunken∣nesse,
that it is but good fellowship, and their sacriledge, that it is the cu∣stome to pay no more; and cover other vices with the like cloakes, may challenge no interest in this promise: but the bruised reed, that is, the con∣trite sinner, he who is displeased with himselfe, because he hath displeased his gracious God; he whose spirit grieveth, because he hath grieved Gods holy Spirit; he who because he hath done that which God abhorreth, ab∣horreth himselfe in dust and ashes; hee who when God chasteneth him for his sinnes, kisseth his heavenly Fathers rod, and acknowledgeth that hee deserveth farre smarter blowes than those which yet hee feeles; hee who goeth mourning all the day long, and will never be at peace with himselfe, till hee hath made his peace with his Maker; hee who alwaies feeling the weight of his sinnes, sigheth and groaneth under them, and never ceaseth to offer up prayers to God with strong cries, till hee be eased of them. Are wee such bruised reeds? We often in stead of denying ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, have with Peter denied our Master; but doe wee weep bit∣terly with him, and (as hee) whensoever hee heard the Cocke crow after the deniall of his Master, fell on weeping afresh; so, doe the wounds of our consciences bleed afresh at the sight of every object, and hearing of every sound, which puts us in mind of our crimson sinnes? We have polluted our beds with David, but doe wee cleanse them as he did? doe wee make our couches to swimme with teares of repentance? Wee have intertained with Mary Magdalen many soule sinnes, like so many uncleane spirits; but have wee broken a boxe of precious oyntment upon Christs head, or kneeled downe and washed his feet with our teares? If wee have done so, then are we bruised reeds indeed, and shall not be broken; but if otherwayes wee be not bruised in heart for our sinnes, and breake them off by mature repen∣tance, wee shall bee either broken for them by sore chastisements in this world, or (which is worst of all) like unfruitfull and rotten trees, be reser∣ved to be fuell for Hell fire. But because the bruised reed was the measure of my former discourse, I will now fall to blow the smoaking flaxe, which Christ will not quench. To quench the light, especially the light of the spirit in our hearts, seemeth to bee a worke of darknesse, how then may it bee ascribed to the Father of lights, or what meaneth the Prophet to deny that Christ will doe that which is so repugnant to his nature, that if he would, he could not doe it? Religiously learned antiquity hath long ago assoyled this doubt, teaching us, that God quencheth as he hardneth, Non infundendo malitiam, sed sub∣ducendo gratiam, not by pouring on any thing like water to quench the flame, but by taking away that oyly moisture which nourisheth it. Our daily experience sheweth us, that a lampe or candle may bee extinguished three manner of wayes at least: 1. By a violent puffe of winde. 2. By the ill condition of the weeke, indisposed to burne. 3. By want of waxe, or defect of oyle to feed it. Even so the light of the Spirit may be quenched in us by three meanes: either by a violent temptation of the evill spirit, as it were a puffe of wind; or by the inbred corruption of our nature, repelling grace, which fitly re∣sembleth the indisposition of the week to take fire, or keep in it the flame;
or lastly, by subtraction of divine grace, which is the oyle or sweet waxe that maintaineth this light. By the first meanes the Divell, by the second man himselfe, by the third God quencheth the light of the spirit in them who love darknesse more than light; but such are not those, who in my Text are compared to smoaking flaxe. For though they have small light of knowledge to shine to others, yet they have heat of devotion burning in themselves:Hil. In haec ver∣ba igniculum fidei concipi∣entes, & qua∣dam dilectione cum carne, jux∣ta fumantes quos Christus non extinxit, sed incendit in iis ignem per∣fectae charita∣tis. they are such, saith St. Hilary, Who conceiving in themselves a small sparke of faith, because they are in part still flesh, burne not cleerly, but as it were smoakily, whom Christ will not quench, but kindle in them the fire of perfect charity. St.Greg. in Evan. Dom. Quod sa∣cerdotes lineis uterentur ve∣stibus. Gregory by smoaking flaxe understandeth the Aaronicall Priesthood now dimly burning, and ready to go out, he thinketh the flaxe to have some reference to the Priests linnen garments made of it. Tertullian paraphraseth the smoaking flaxe, Momentaneum gentium fervo∣rem, The momentary fervour of the Gentiles, in whom the light of nature by sinfull filthinesse being extinct, exhaleth most pestiferous fumes of noysome lusts. St.Chrysost. in Matth. ca. 2. . Chrysostome and St. Austin through the smoake discerne the Scribes and Pharisees, and other enemies of Christ, their envie and malice which soultred within them, but brake not out into an open flame. Whom Christ quenched not, that is, destroyed not, though he could have as easily done it, as breake a reed already bruised, or tread out a stinking snuffe cast upon the ground. But these expositions in the judgement of later Divines seem either constrained and forced, or at the lest too much restrained and narrow. They therfore extend the meaning of them to all weak Christians, either newly converted or relapsed,Pintus. In quibus tamen relucet aliquid bonae spei.Junius. Scintilla aliqua pietatis veluti moribunda.Aquinas. Tepidi ad opus bonum, habentes tamen aliquid gratiae.Arboreus. Extinctioni vicini.Guilliandus. Qui sceleribus gra∣vissimis, seu fumo quodam oculos bonorum offendunt, & veluti foetore cor∣ruptae famae mores piorum infestant: Breathing out bitter fumes for their sinnes, offending the godly with the ill savour of their lives, luke-warm to good workes, neere extinction, in whom yet remaines some light of faith and hope, though very obscure, some warmth of charity, some sparke of grace. Comfort then, O comfort the fainting spirits, and cheare up the drouping conscience, say to the bruised reed that is now unfit to make a pipe to sound, or a cane to write the praises of God, thou shalt not be broken; and to the smoaking flaxe, which gives but a very dimme light, and with the fume offendeth the eyes of the godly, and with the stench their noses, thou shalt not bee quenched. Nothing is so easie as to breake a reed already bruised, the least weight doth it; nothing so facile as to quench smoaking flaxe, the least touch doth it: yet so milde was our Saviour, that he never brake the one, nor quenched the other. The flaxe or weeke smoaketh, either before it is fully kindled, or after it is blowne out. If we consider it in the first condi∣tion, the morall or spirituall meaning of the Text is, that Christ cherisheth the weake endeavours, and small beginnings of grace in his children. For we must know, that in our first conversion the measure of grace is but small in us, and mixt with much corruption, which if Christ should quench, there would be found never a cleere burning lampe in his Church; but hee most graciously preserveth it, and augmenteth it, because it is a sparke from hea∣ven kindled by his owne spirit: and it much illustrateth his glory, to keep it
from going out, notwithstanding the indisposition of the weeke to burne, and continuall blasts of temptation ready to blow it out. I said in my haste, quoth David, I am cast out of thy sight: there is smoake in the flaxe,Psal. 31.22. yet was not the flaxe quenched; for he addeth, yet thou heardest the voice of my prayer. Jonas in like manner cries, I am cast out of thy sight:Jonah 2.4. there is smoak in the flaxe, yet was not the flaxe quenched; for he addeth immediatly, yet I will looke againe to thy holy Temple. If thou wilt, thou canst,Matth. 8.2. said one poore man in the Gospel. Lord, if thou canst, said another;Marke 9.22. both these were as the smoaking flaxe in my Text. For the former doubted of Gods power, the latter of his will, yet neither of both were quenched. O miserable man that I am, saith S. Paul, in the person of a Christian travelling in his new birth, who shall deliver me from this body of death? here is a cloud of smoak,Rom. 7.24.25. yet it is blown away in an instant, and the flame breaketh out, and blazeth into Gods praises; Thankes be unto God, who hath given us victory through Jesus Christ. Man for a little smoake will quench the light; but Christ eve∣ry where cherisheth the least sparke of grace, and bloweth it gently by his spirit, till it breake forth into a flame. To encourage us the more, hee ac∣cepteth the will for the deed, and a good assay for the performance. If thou canst but shed a teare for thy sins, he hath a bottle to put it in; if thou steale a sigh in secret, he hath an eare for it; if thy faith be but as a graine of mu∣stard seed, it shall grow to a great tree. Nathanael at the first had but a small ground to beleeve that Christ should bee the Messias; but after∣wards Christ made good his words unto him, hee saw greater things to build his faith upon: Because I said unto thee,John 1.50. I saw thee under the fig-tree, beleevest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these. Apollos at the first was but catechized in Johns Baptisme,Act. 18.27.28. but afterwards Aquila and Priscilla expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly, and hee helped them much which had beleeved through grace: for hee mightily convicted the Jewes, and that publikely, shewing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ. Joseph of Arimathea, richer in grace than wealth, and a great dispreader of the Gospel, and (as many ancient Writers report) the first planter of Christian Religion in this Island, yet till Christs death had small courage to professe him; but when the evening was come,Mar. 15.42.43. which was the preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, hee went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. Saint Augustine at the first was drawne to the Church by the lustre of Saint Ambrose his elo∣quence, as himselfeAug. confess. l. 5. c. 4. confesseth: but afterwards he was much more taken with the strength of his proofe, than the ornaments of his speech; and God by his Spirit so blowed the sparke of divine knowledge in this smoaking flaxe, that the Church of God never saw a cleerer lamp burning in it since it had him. If we consider the smoaking flaxe in the second condition, to wit, after the lampe is blowne out, the spirituall meaning is, That those in whom there was ever any spark of saving grace, shall never be quenched; or that after the most fearfull blast of temptation, there remaines yet some divine fire in the heart of every true beleever, which Christ will never quench. Christ will not quench the smoaking flaxe, if there bee any sparke of divine fire in it: yet if this sparke bee not blowne, and the weeke enlightened againe, it
will dye; in like manner if wee doe not according to the Apostles pre∣cept,2 Tim. 1.6. , stirre up the grace of God in us, and use the utmost of our religious endeavours to kindle againe the lampe of faith in our soules, that sparke of divine faith and saving grace which wee con∣ceive that wee have, will dye. As it is not presumption, but faith, to bee confident in Gods promises when wee walke in his Ordi∣nances; so it is not faith, but presumption, to assure our selves of the end, when wee neglect the meanes of our salvation. Wee may no otherwise apprehend or apply unto our selves the gracious pro∣mises made to all true beleevers in the Gospel, than they are pro∣pounded unto us, which is not absolutely, but upon conditions by us to bee performed through the helpe of divine grace, namely, to wash our selves,Esa. 1.16, 17. to make us cleane, to put away the evill of our do∣ings from before Gods eyes, to cease to doe evill, to learne to doe well, to seeke judgement, to relieve the oppressed, to judge the father∣lesse,Dan. 4.27. Job 41.. Apoc. 3.19. Mat. 3.8. and to pleade for the widow, to breake off our sinnes by righ∣teousnesse, and our iniquity by shewing mercy to the poore, to abhorre our selves, and repent in dust and ashes, to remember from whence wee are fallen, and doe our first workes, to bee zealous and amend, and to bring forth fruits meet for repentance. To argue from a strong perswasion of our election, and from thence to inferre im∣mediately assurance of salvation, is, as Tertullian speaketh in another case, aedificare in ruinam. The safe way to build our selves in our most holy faith, and surely fasten the anchor of our hope, is to con∣clude from amendment of life, repentance unto life: from our hatred of sinne, Gods love unto us: from hunger and thirst after righte∣ousnesse, some measure of grace: from godly sorrow and sonne-like feare, and imitation of our heavenly Father, the adoption of sonnes: from continuall growth in grace, perseverance to the end: from the fruits of charity, the life of our faith: and from all, a modest assu∣rance of our election unto eternall life. Not curiously to dispute the Scholasticall question concerning the absolute impossibilitie of the apostacy of any Saint, and the amissibility of justifying faith, which many learned Doctours of the Reformed Churches hold fitter to bee extermined than determined, or at least confined to the Schooles, than defined in the Pulpit: that wherein all parties agree is sufficient to comfort the fainting spirits, and strengthen the feeble knees of any relapsed Christian; That God will never bee wanting to raise him, if hee bee not wanting to himselfe. But if when hee is returned, with the Sow to his wallowing in the mire, hee taketh delight therein, and never striveth to plucke his feet out of it, nor rise up out of the dirt, if hee never cry for helpe, nor so much as put forth the hand of his faith, that Christ may take hold of it, and by effectuall grace draw him out of the mudde: hee will certainly putrifie in his sinnes. Hee that heareth the Word of God preached, and assenteth there∣unto, and is most firmly perswaded of Gods love to him for the present, if through the rebellion of the flesh against the spirit, or the suggestions of Sathan, or by the wicked counsels and examples
of others, hee chargeth himselfe with any foule sinne, either of impiety against God, or iniquity against men, or impurity against his owne body, doth not his conscience tell him, that God is high¦ly displeased with him? doth hee not feele the effects of his wrath in his soule, and oftentimes in his body and estate also? and if the hand of God upon him bring him not to a sight, and a sense, and an acknowledgement, and a detestation also of his sinne, dare any man secure his salvation? On the contrary, if after his relapse, his heart smite him, and hee feeles the pricke of conscience, if there bee any sparke in the weeke, any bitter fume drawing teares from his eyes, any fervour of zeale, any heate of love in him, any vehement desire of saving grace, though hee receive the sentence of death in himselfe, and breathe out his last gaspe in a disconsolate sigh, and with a lamentable groane; yet none doubteth, but that he may passe even by the gates of Hell into Heaven. There is nothing so easie or frequent, as for a man to slip or fall who walketh upon the ice; and what is this world, compared by Saint John to a sea of glasse,Apoc. 15.2. but slippery ice? in which though they who goe most warily slide often, and receive grievous falls; yet they may take such hold on the one side upon the promises of God,Jer. 31.40. (I will not turne away from them to doe them good, but I will put my feare in their hearts, that they shall not depart from mee:) and on the other side upon Christs praier, (I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not) that they fall not ir∣recoverably, or so dangerously, as that they dye of their fall.Luke 22.31. For whose comfort in their fearfullest conflicts with dispaire, I will lay such grounds of confidence, as will amount to a hope that maketh not ashamed, and at least to a morall assurance of the recovery of their for∣mer estate. In the ninth of Proverbs and the first, wee have a description of a house built by Wisedome:Prov. 9.1. Wisedome, saith hee, hath built her an house, shee hath hewen out her seven pillars. By this house, albeit some of the Ancients understand the incarnation of the Sonne of God, who is the Wisedome of his Father, and might bee said then to build him an house, when hee framed a body to himselfe; yet may it bee applyed to the spirituall house, which every Christian buildeth by faith upon the rocke Christ Jesus; for as that, so this standeth upon seven pillars: 1. The constancy of Gods love in Christ. 2. The certainty of his decrees. 3. The truth of his promises. 4. The power of regenerating grace. 5. The efficacy of Christs prayer and intercession for all Belee∣vers. 6. The safegard of the Almighties protection. 7. The testimony of the true ancient Church, which the Apostle him∣selfe graceth with the title of the pillar and ground of truth. The first pillar to support this building is the constancy of Gods love to all that are in Christ; which may be thus hewen to our purpose. They upon
whom God setteth such an especiall affection in Christ, that hee maketh a covenant of peace, and entreth into a contract of marriage with them, can never bee cast utterly out of favour, much lesse grow into eternall hatred and detestation, in such sort that they become the objects of endlesse mi∣sery, and subjects of everlasting malediction. For this kindnesse, whereby the Lord our Redeemer hath mercy on us,Esa. 1.54.8. With everlasting kindnesse will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Re∣deemer. Ver. 10. The mountains shal depart, and the ls be remo∣ved, but my kindnesse shall not depart from thee, neither shall the cove∣nant of my peace be remo∣ved. is everlasting. The covenant of this peace is immoveable, this contract is indissoluble:Hos. 2.19, 20. I will betroth thee un∣to mee for ever; I will betroth thee unto mee in righteousnesse, and in judge∣ment, and in loving kindnesse, and in mercies. I will betroth thee unto mee in faithfulnesse, and thou shalt know the Lord. But all true beleevers are embraced with this love, comprised within this covenant, parties in this contract. What then can steale their hearts from Christ, or alienate his love from them?Rom. 8, 35.38. What shal separate them from this love of God in Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakednesse, or pe∣rill? No, neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. That fire which generateth and produceth its owne fuell can never goe out; and what is the fuell which nourisheth this heavenly flame, but grace and vertue in us, which it selfe continually worketh in all them that are new creatures in Christ? Men affect others because of worth: but contrariwise, Gods affection causeth worth in all who are indeared unto him. All the spirituall beauty they have wherewith he is enamoured, is no other than the reflection and glisening of the beames of his grace, whichHeb. 12.2. Looking unto Jesus the be∣ginner and fini∣sher of our faith. beginneth and consummateth all good in us,Phil. 2.13. For it is God that worketh in us both to will and to doe of his good pleasure. working in us both the wil & the deed. Philosophy teacheth that the celestiall and superiour bodies work upon the terrestriall and inferiour, but not on the contrary. The stormes or calmes in the aire change not the motions or influence of the starres: but contrari∣wise the motions, conjunctions and influences of the Starres cause such variety in the ayre and earth. The rayes of the visible Sunne are not moved at all by the motion of the object, but immoveably flow from the body of that Planet; and though blustering windes tyrannize in the ayre, and remove it a thousand times out of its place in an houre, yet they stirre not therewith: in like manner, though our affections are tran∣sported with every gale of prosperity and storme of adversity, and our wills somewhat yeeld to every wind of temptation; yet Gods affections, like the beames of the Sunne, remaine immoveable where they are once fixed. Wee play fast and loose even with those often∣times to whom wee are bound in the strongest bonds of duty and love; wee praise and dispraise with a breath, frowne and smile with a looke,Esay 55.8. love and hate with a conceit: but Gods affections are not like ours,John 13.1. nor are his thoughts our thoughts. For having loved his owne which were in the world,2 Tim. 2.13. hee loveth them unto the end: and though we beleeve not, yet hee abideth faithfull; he cannot deny himselfe. The second pillar is the certainty of Gods decree for the salvation of the Elect;2 Tim. 2 19. and thus I reare it up. The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seale, The Lord knoweth them that are his. How should hee not know them whom he fore-knew before the world began, and wrote their names
in the booke of life?Apoc. 13.8. Phil. 4.3 With my fellow la∣bourers, whose names are in the book of life. Exod 28.21. A glorious type whereof was the engraving the names of the twelve Tribes in twelve precious stones, with the point of a Diamond, never to be razed out. To seduce any of the Elect, our SavioursMat. 24.24. And they shall shew great signes and won∣ders, in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very Elect. If supposeth it to be impossible, for this were to plucke Christs sheep out of his hand,Joh. 10.28, 29 They shall ne∣ver perish, nei∣ther shall any man pluck them out of my hand: My Father which gave them  is grea∣ter than all, and no man is able to plucke them out of my Fa∣thers hand. which none can do. All the Elect are those blessed ones on Christs right hand, to whom he shall say at the day of Judgement,Mat. 25.34. Come ye bles∣sed of my Father, inherite the kingdome prepared for you before the founda∣tion of the world was laid: they are the Church of the first borne, which are writtenHeb. 12.23. in heaven. Now although all that yeeld their assent to supernatu∣rall verities revealed in Scripture, may not presume that their names are written in the booke of life; for Simon Magus beleeved, yet was he inAct. 18.13, 23 the gall of bitternesse, and bond of iniquity: nay theJam. 2.19. Divels themselves, as St. James teacheth us, beleeve, who areJude 6. reserved in chaines of dark∣nesse, unto the judgement of the great day: yet they who beleeve in God em∣brace the promises of the Gospell, with the condition of denying of ungod∣linesse, and worldly lusts; and living godly, righteously, and soberly in this pre∣sent world, and lay fast hold on Christ, have (no doubt) attained that faith, which Saint Paul stileth,Tit. 1.1. the faith of Gods Elect: and SaintAct 13.48. & 15.9. Luke ma∣keth an effect of predestination to eternall life: for such aRom. 3.28. Joh. 1.12. faith purifieth the heart, justifieth before God, putteth us into the state of adoption, worketh by love, and is accompanied with repentance unto life: which gifts are never bestowed upon any reprobate, if we will beleeve the ancientGreg. l. 28. in Job. c. 6. Extra Ecclesiae men∣suras omnes re∣probi, etiamsi intra fidei limi∣tem esse vide∣antur. Aug. cont. Pel. l. 1. c 4 & de unit. eccl. c. 23. Hoc donum propium est eorum qui reg∣nabunt cum Christo. Plin. nat. hist. l. 21. c. 8. Post∣quam d ficere cuncti flores, mdefactus a∣qua reviviscit, & hybernas co∣ron is facit. Fathers. The seed of this faith being sown in good ground, taketh deepe root downeward in humility, and groweth upward in hope, and spreadeth abroad by charity, and bringeth forth fruits of good workes in great abundance: it resembleth the true Amaranthus, which, after all the flowers are blowne away, or drop downe at the fall of the leafe, being watered at the root, reviveth and serveth to make winter garlands: even so a firme and well grounded beliefe, after the flowers of open profession of Christ are blown away by the violent blasts of persecution and temptation, being moistened with the dew of grace from heaven, and the water of penitent teares, reviveth againe, and flourisheth and furnisheth the Church, Christs Spouse, as it were with winter garlands, unlooked and unhoped for. The third pillar. The love of God is not more constant than his decrees are certaine; nor his decrees more certaine than his promises are faithfull: Therefore in the third place I erect for a third pillar, to support the do∣ctrine delivered out of this Scripture, the promise of perseverance; which I need not hew nor square for the building, it fitteth of it selfe. For it im∣plieth contradiction, that they who are endued with the grace of perseve∣rance, should utterly fall away from grace. Constancy is not constancy if it vary, perseverance is not perseverance if it faile. And therfore S.Aug. de bono persev c. 6. Hoc donum suppliciter emereri potest, sed cum datum est, contumaciter amittti non potest; promodo enim potest amitti, per quod fit ut non amittatur, etiam quod possit amitti? Austin acutely determines, that this gift may be obtained by humble praier, but after what it is given, it cannot bee lest by proud contumacy: for how should that gift it selfe bee lost, which keepeth all other graces from being lost, which otherwise might bee lost? When I name the gift of perseverance in the state of grace, I understand with that holy Father, such a gift,
Aug. de cor∣rep. & grt. c. 12. Non sol n ut sine isto do∣no persevran∣tes ess non possunt, verum etiam ut per hoc donū non nisi perseveran∣tes sint. Gratia qua subventum est infirmitati voluntatis hu∣manae, ut inde∣clinabiliter & insuperabiliter ageretur, & quam vis infir∣ma non defice∣ret nec adversi∣tate aliqua vin∣ceretur, sed quod bonum est invictissimè vellet, & hoc differere invi∣ctissimè nollet. not onely without which wee cannot persevere, but with which we cannot but persevere. Such an heavenly grace, whereby the infirmity of mans will is supported in such sort, that it is led by the spirit unfailably and unconquerably, so that though it be weake, yet it never faileth, nor is overcome by any temp∣tation, but cleaveth most stedfastly to that which is good, and cannot by any power bee drawne to forsake it. This gift of the faithfull is shadowed out by those similitudes (whereto the godly and righteous man in Scripture is compared) viz. of aPsal. 1.3. tree planted by the river side, whose leafe shall not wi∣ther. Of the hill of Sion, which may not be removed, but standeth fast for ever, Psal. 125.1. Of aMat. 7.24. house built upon a rocke, Quae Obvia ventorum furiis expostaque ponto Vim cunctam, atque minas perfert coelique marisque Ipsa immota manens. Upon which though the raine descended, and the flouds came, and the windes blew and beat on it, yet it fell not; for it was founded upon a rocke: but it is fully, plainly, and most evidently expressed, & promised in those words ofJer. 32.40. Jeremy, I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turne away from them to doe them good, and I will put my feare in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. Which Text of the Prophet is by theHeb. 5.10. Apostle applied to the faithfull under the Gospel, and thus expounded by S. Austin:Aug. l. de bo∣no persev. c. 2. Timorem dabo in cor, ut non recedant, quid est aliud quam talis ac tantus erit timor, ut mihi perseve∣ranter adhaere∣ant? I will put my feare in their hearts, that they depart not from me, what is it else than to say, the feare which I put in their hearts shall be such, and so great, that they shall assuredly or perseveringly cleave unto me? They whose hearts are kept alwaies in this feare, need never feare finall Apostacy from God. CounterfeitSen. de clem. l. 1. Nemo po∣test personam diu ferte, ficta cito in naturam suam recidunt. things are discovered by their disconti∣nuance & variation, but true by their lasting. That which glareth for a time in the aire, and out-braveth the stars, even of the first rank or magnitude, but after a few daies playeth least in sight, is a Comet, no true starre: Stella cadens, non est stella, cometa fuit. Likewise that which glistereth like gold, yet endureth not the fire, is Al∣chymy stuffe, no pretious metall. The stone that sparkleth like a Diamond, yet abideth not the stroke, is a cornish or counterfeit, not a true orient Dia∣mond. It is artificiall complexion and meere painting, not true beauty, which weareth out in a day, and is washed off with a showre. Feigned things, and false, saith theCic. de sc. l. 3. Ficta omnia tanquam slos∣culi decidunt, vera gloria a∣dices agi, {que} etiam propaga∣tur. Oratour, soone fall like blossomes; true glory ta∣keth root, and spreadeth it selfe. The truth himselfe, ourJoh. 8 31. Lord and Savi∣our, maketh perseverance a certain note of true Disciples: If yee continue in my word, then are you my Disciples indeed. Would any of you know whether he be a true sonne of God, and member of Christ? he can by no thing so infallibly finde it in himselfe, as by the gift of perseverance. This St.1 Joh. 2.19. John giveth for a touch-stone of a true Apostle, They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had beene of us, they would have conti∣nued with us; but they went out, that they might bee made manifest that they were not of us. Saint Paul of a trueHeb. 3.6. member of Christ, or temple of the ho∣ly Ghost: But Christ is a sonne over his owne house, whose house are wee, if wee hold fast the confidence and the rejoycing of the hope firme to the end. SaintAug. de cor∣rep. & grat. c. 9. Tunc verè sunt quod appellan∣tur, si manse∣int in co propter quod sic appellantur. Augustine of the true children of God: Then they are truely what
they are called (the sonnes of God) if they continue in that for which they are so called. The fourth pillar I named unto you was the power of regenerating grace,1 Pet. 1.3, 4. whereby wee are begotten againe unto a lively hope by the resurre∣ction of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible and un∣defiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for us. That which is incorruptible cannot bee destroyed or perish; that which is reserved for us, cannot be taken away from us. Now if any demand what preserveth faith in the soule, in such sort that it is never habitually lost, though the act thereof be sometimes suspended; I answer: 1. Outwardly, the powerfull ministry of the Word and Sacraments. 2. Inwardly, renewing grace infused into the soule at the first mo∣ment of our conversion. This grace is by the holy Ghost termed theJam. 1.21. Receive with meeknesse the engraffed word, which is able to save your soules. engraffed word, some∣times the1 Joh. 2.27. But the an∣nointing which ye hve received of him abideth in you: and as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. annointing that abideth in us, sometimes the1 Cor. 3.16. Know ye not that ye are the temples of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you? spirit dwelling in us, sometimes aJohn 4.14. Whosoever drinketh of the water I shall give him, shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a Well of water springing to e∣verlasting life. Well of water springing up to everlasting life, sometimes Gods1 John 3.9. Whosoever is borne of God doth not cōmit sin; for his seed remaineth in him. seed remaining in us, sometimes1 Pet. 3.23. Being borne a∣gaine, not of corruptible seed, but of in∣corruptible, by the Word of God which li∣veth and abi∣deth for ever. incorruptible seed: whence we may frame an argument like to that of our Saviours to Nicodemus, AsJohn 3.6. That which is borne of the flesh is flesh, but that which is borne of the spirit is spirit. that which is borne of corruptible seed, is corruptible; so that which is borne of incorruptible seed, is incorruptible. How can he that is borne of incorruptible and spirituall seed be corrupted, and dye spiritually? how can hee that hath in his belly a Well of ever-springing water, thirst eternally? how can he in whom the annointing S. John speaketh of abideth, putresie in his sinnes? how can hee in whom the spirit dwelleth, be estranged from the love of God? how can he that is borne of God, become a childe of the Divell? Saint1 John 3.9. John strongly argueth against it: Whosoever is born of God cannot commit sinne, because he is borne of God. I conclude this argument with that daring interrogation of SaintAug. de bono persev. c. 7. Contra tam claram veritatis tubam, quis voce ulls auat humanas? Austin; Against so cleere and loud sounding trumpet of divine truth, what man of a sober and watchfull faith will endure to heare any voices or words from man? The fifth pillar is Christs prayer for the perseverance of all true beleevers. The pillar is like to Jacobs ladder, that reacheth from earth to heaven; and though heaven and earth be shaken, yet this pillar will stand immoveable. I know, saith Christ, that thou,John 16.23. Verely, verely, I say unto you, whatsoever you aske the Father in my name, he will give it you. O Father, hearest mee alwaies. If wee ob∣taine whatsoever we aske for Christs sake, shall not Christ obtaine what he asketh for us? If the Word of God sustaine the whole frame of nature, shall not Christs prayer be able to support a weake Christian? Doth God heare the softest voice, and lowest sigh and groane of his children upon earth, and will he not heare the loud cry of his Sonne in his bosome in hea∣ven? What therefore if Sathan seeke to winnow us like wheat? SaintCypr. de simpl. prelat. Triticum non rapit ventus, manes paleae tempestate jactantur. Cy∣prian biddeth us never to feare blowing away: It is empty chaffe that is blowne away with the winde, the corne still abides on the floore. Shall Sa∣thans fanning bee more powerfull to scatter, than Christs prayer to ga∣ther us? shall any winde of temptation be of more force to blow us out of the heape, than the breath of Christ himselfe to keep us in?Luke 21.31, 32. Sathan hath
sought to winnow you like wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not. Upon which words SaintAug. de cor∣rep. & grat. c. 8 Quando rogavit Chri∣stus ne Petri fi∣des deficeret, quid aliud ro∣gavit nisi ut haberet in fide liberrimam, fortissimam, perseverantis∣simam volun∣tatem? Austin thus enlargeth himselfe: When Christ prayed for Peter, that his faith might not faile, what did hee pray for else, but that he might have a most free, a most firme, a most constant will to continue in the faith? Yea, but it may be excepted, that this praier of Christ is a good protection for St. Peter, but not for us: he is thereby se∣cured from Apostacy, not we. Why so? Peter is not here considered as the first precious stone in the foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem, shining in spirituall graces above his brethren; but as one graine or seed among o∣thers to bee winnowed by Sathan, which is the common case of all the faithfull: & therefore what Christ prayed for Peter, he prayed for all of the same heape that then were, or hereafter shall be winnowed by Sathan. Thus SaintAug. de cor∣rep. & grat. c. 12. Dicente Christo rogavi pro te, ne defi∣ciat fides tua, intelligamus ci dictum qui aedificatur su∣per petram, ita homo D in Domino glori∣atur, non solum quia misericor∣diam consecu∣tus ut esset fi∣delis, sed etiam quia fides ipsa non deficit. Austin conceiveth of our Saviours prayer, when Christ said, I have prayed for thee, Peter, that thy faith faile not; let us understand it to be spo∣ken to him that is built upon a rocke: for hereby the man of God boasteth in the Lord, not only because he hath obtained mercy to become a beleever, but also because faith it selfe faileth not. Nay, our Lord himselfe thus ex∣poundeth himselfe:John 17.20, 21, 23. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall beleeve on me through their word, that they may be also one in us: I in them, and thou in mee, that they may bee made perfect in one, &c. I will close this straine with a quaver, like to that ofPlin. in pane∣gyr. lurat is per quem juramus. Pliny to Trajane, What a favour is this, what security, what happinesse, he sweareth by whom wee all sweare? so may I say with farre greater reason, What a favour doth God vouchsafe unto us, what security doth he give us, what a happinesse is it for us, Orat is per quem oramus; Hee prayeth for us by whom wee pray, nay, to whom we pray: by whom we pray as our Mediatour; to whom we pray as God, and in whose name we obtaine all that we pray for? The sixth pillar is a pillar of brasse, as strong as a castle of Diamond, to secure the person of the faithfull, the safegard of Gods protection. This pillar is thus erected by Saint1 Pet. 1.4, 5. Peter, Those that are begotten againe to a lively hope, are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation; and therefore cannot be drawn away through infidelity to perdition. The Pa∣trons of the apostacy of Saints cannot infringe this argument, unlesse they could weaken or shorten the arme of the Almighty, who is2 Tim 1.12. able to keep that which is committed unto him against that day; and not able only, but2 Thes. 3.3. faith∣full also to establish us, and keep us from evill, and confirme us, not for a time only, but to the end, that we may be1 Cor. 1.8. blamelesse in the day in the Lord Jesus: which, according to his gracious promises, hee most certainly per∣formeth two manner of wayes: 1. Partly by arming us continually with new strength of grace to resist temptation, in what kind soever. 2. Partly by inhibiting and restraining the assaults themselves, both in respect of 1. The violence, 2. The continuance of them. To the first point SaintGreg. l. 28. moral in Job c. 7. Novit pro custodia nostra restringere quod contra nos egredi pro justitiae xerci∣tio permittit, ut saeviens nos dilua procella, non mergat. Gregory speaketh pertinently: Our gracious God for our health and safety knoweth how to keep that within bounds, which hee suffereth in justice to goe out against us, in such sort that the
raging storme shall wash us all over, but shall not drowne us. The second point SaintAmbr. com∣ment. in 1 Co∣rinth. 10. Non plus permitti∣tur ei imponi, quàm scitur ferre posse, ut quarto die pati non permitta∣tur, qui scitur ultra triduum non posse tole∣rare. Ambrose fully hitteth: God, saith he, doth so proportion the burthen to our shoulders, that hee suffereth not more to bee laid upon any, than he knoweth may be borne, so that he permitteth not a man to be in durance the fourth day, whose patience he knoweth cannot hold out beyond the third. The Apostles words reach home to both:1 Cor. 10.13. God is faithfull, who will not suffer you to bee tempted above that you are able, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to beare it: Hoc est scutum Vulcanicum, This is armour of proofe indeed against darts, ar∣rowes, bullets, swords, or push of pike. If we shall never be tempted above our strength, we shall alwayes be strengthned above temptation; and con∣sequently, never bee overcome of it.Plin l. 12. nat. hist. c. 9. Flucti∣bus pulsatae re∣sistunt immo∣tae, quin & ple∣no aestu operi∣untur, appa∣retque argu∣mentis asperi∣tate aquarum illas ali. Pliny writeth of a strange kinde of trees growing in the red sea, which being beat upon by the waves stand immoveable, yea sometimes when in a full sea they are covered over with water: and it appeares by many arguments, that they are bettered by the roughnesse of the waters; even so a Christian planted in the red sea by faith in Christs bloud, resisteth all the waves of temptation, and the more hee is beat upon, yea and overwhelmed also sometimes with the billowes of trou∣bles and afflictions, the better he thriveth spiritually in grace. The seventh and last pillar to uphold the doctrine delivered, is the judge∣ment of the ancient Church, upon record in the authenticall writings of the ancient Fathers that flourished within sixe hundred yeeres after Christ. I will onely alledge such passages as upon this occasion I had time to examine. Origen for antiquities sake shall begin the verdict. It is the manner of the Scripture to begin with those things which are sad and dreadfull, and to end with those things which are chearfull and comfortable: God saith not,Orig. in Jer. homil. 1. Non dicitur vivifi∣cabo & occi∣dam; sed occi∣dam & vivifi∣cabo: impossi∣bile est enim quod Deus se∣mel vivificavit, ab eodem ipso vel ab alio oc∣cidi. I will make alive, and I will kill; but I will kill, and I will make alive: for it is impossible that what God once quickneth (hee meaneth by spirituall grace) should ever be killed or destroyed, either by himselfe or any other. Saint Cyprian secondeth Origen, who will haveCyp. de simpl. prelat. Nemo aestimet bonos de Ecclesia pos∣se discedere: triticum non rapit ventus, nec arborem solidâ radice fundatam pro∣cella subvertit. no man entertaine any such thought, as if good men and true beleevers ever revolted finally from the Church: Let no man conceive, saith hee, that good men can depart from the Church: the winde blowes not away the wheat, neither doth the storme o∣verthrow a tree sound at root; they are like empty chaffe which are scattered away with a whirlewind, and weake and rotten trees which are blown down in a tempest. Saint Chrysostome joyneth upon the same issue, commenting upon the words of Saint Paul (by whom also wee have accesse by faith unto this grace wherein we stand) thus, He saith well the grace wherein wee stand: the phrase is worth the noting; for such indeed is the nature of Gods grace,Chrys. homil. in ep. ad Rom. c. 5. . it is stable and constant, it hath no end, it knowes no period, but proceeds alwaies from lesser to greater matters. Those whom grace maketh to stand and grow continually, cannot fall totally nor finally. Saint Ambrose accordeth with Saint Chrysostome in his observation upon the second Epistle to the Corinthians, chap. 3.3. The words of Saint Paul are, Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministred by us, written not with inke, but with the Spirit of the living God,
not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart. St.Amo Comment. in 2. Cor. 3.3. Nunc legem veterem pulsat, uae pimum data in lapideis tabulis abolita est, fractis tabu∣lis sub Mnte à Mose: nunc autem lex in animo scribi∣tur, hoc est, in corde, non per calamum, sed per spiritum, quia fides ae∣terna res est, à spiritu scribi∣tu, ut manet. Ambrose his note upon this place is; Here hee toucheth upon or striketh at the old Law, which first being given in tables of stone, is abolished, the tables being bro∣ken under the Mount by Moses: but now the Law is written in the mind, not with a quill or pen, but by the spirit; because faith is an eternall thing, it is written by the spirit, that it may abide or still continue. Saint Austin and Saint Gregory cleerly conclude on our side, by exclu∣ding all from the number of Christs Disciples, and Sonnes of God, and Saints, whose revolt and apostacy proveth their hypocrisie. SaintAug de correp. & grat.  9. Qui non habent perseve anti∣am, cut non veè Discipuli Christi, ita nec verè Filii Dei fueunt, etiam quando esse vi∣debantur. & ita vocabantur. Austin speaketh definitively: Those who have not the gift of perseverance, as they are not truly Christs Disciples, so neither were they ever truly the Sonnes of God, no not when they seemed to be so. And SaintGreg. moral. in Job l. 34. c 13. Aurum quod pravis diaboli persuasioibus sterni sicut lu∣tum potuerit, aurum ante oculos Dei nunquam fuit; & qui seduci quando{que} non reversuri pos∣sunt, qua iha∣bitam sanctita∣té ante oculos hominum vide∣antur amittere, sed eam ante oculos Dei nunquam ha∣bucrunt. Gregory is as peremptory: It may, saith he, peradventure trouble a weake Christian, that this Leviathan hath such power that hee can trample gold under his feet like dirt; that is, subject unto himselfe men shining in the brightnesse of holinesse, by defiling them with vices: but wee have an answer ready at hand, that the gold, which by wicked perswasions of the Divell can be laid under his feet like dirt, was never gold in the sight of God; and they who may be so seduced that they never returne againe, may seeme to lose the habit of sanctity before the eyes of men, but before the eyes of God they never were endued with any such habit. You see with a little blowing what a cleere light the smoaking flaxe in my Text giveth to this Theologicall verity (viz.) that regenerating grace and justifying faith cannot be utterly lost, or totally extinct. Feele, I beseech you now, what warmth it yeeldeth to our cold affections, and sometimes benummed consciences: and first to our cold affections. Is the oyntment of the Spirit so precious, that the least drop of it saveth the life of the soule? Is the least seed of the Word incorruptible? Is the smallest sparke of true charity unquenchable? Cannot justifying faith be ever lost; nor the state of grace forfeited? Why then doe we not strive for this state? why doe we not, with the rich Merchant in the Gospel, sell all that wee have to gaine this pearle of faith? When we have got it, why doe we not more highly value it in our selves and others? Other pearles and precious stones adorne but the body, or cover some imperfection in it; this beautifieth the soule, and covereth all the skarres and deformities therein. Other Jew∣els, be they never so rich, are but presents for earthly Princes; but with this pearle the King of Heaven is taken, and it is the price of that King∣dome. Other pearles have their estimation from men; but men have their estimation from this pearle. Other Jewels when they are got may bee lost, and that very easily; but this Jewell of faith, if it bee true and not counterfeit, after it is once gotten can never be lost. All the thoughts of worldly men are employed, all their cares taken up, all their time bestow∣ed, all their meanes spent in purchasing, or some way procuring unto them∣selves a fortune (as they terme it) as a beneficiall office, or an estate of land of inheritance, or lease for terme of yeeres or lives; all which are yet sub∣ject to a thousand casualties. Why do they not rather looke after and la∣bour for the state of grace, which is past all hazzard, being assured to us by the hand-writing of God, and the seale of his Spirit? An estate not for
terme of yeers, but for eternity; an estate not of land upon earth, but of an inheritance immortall, undefiled, reserved in heaven; an estate which cannot be spoiled or wasted by hostile invasion, nor wrung from us by power, nor won by law, nor morgaged for debt, nor impaired by publike calamity, nor endangered by change of Princes, nor voided by death it selfe. S.Chrysost. in c. 5. ad Rom. . Chryso∣stome his eloquence exspatiateth in this field: A man, saith he, hath recei∣ved rule glory, and power here, but enjoyeth it not perpetually, but very soone fals from it. For though no man take it from him; death will quite strip him of it. But the gifts of God are not such, or like to the gifts of Prin∣ces. For neither man, nor time, nor circumstances of actions, nor reason of state, nor the Divell himselfe, nay, nor death, can deprive him of them, or put him by them. You see how the smoaking flaxe being blowne, kindles the heat of our zeale, and enflameth us on the purchasing the estate of grace by the price of Christs bloud. Feele now (I beseech you) in the second place, what warmth it yeeldeth to a benummed conscience, and a soule frozen in the dregs of sinne. That the bruised reed shall not bee broken, nor smoaking flaxe be quenched, is a doctrine of singular comfort and use; yet must it be very discreetly handled, and seasonably applyed to such and such onely as are heavie laden, and bruised with the weight and sense of their sinne, and through inward or outward affliction smoake for them: and are, as Arbo∣reus speaketh, extinctioni vicini, neere to be utterly quenched through in∣undation of sorrow. To tell a presumptuous sinner in the height of his pride, and heat of his lust, and top and top gallant of his vaine glory,Rectus in Cu∣riâ. that he stands straight in the Court of heaven, is in the state of grace, and can never fall away from it, or become a cast-away, is to minister hot potions to a man in a burning fever, which is the ready way to stifle him, and as soone to rid him of his life as of his paine: hot cordials and strong waters are to be given in a languishing fit, and a cold sweat, when the patient is in danger of swouning. It is the part, saith S.Aug. de bono persev. c. 22. Do∣losi vel imperi∣ti medici est, etiam utile me∣dicamentum sic alligare, ut aut non prosit, aut etiam obsit. Austin, of a deceitfull or unskilfull Physi∣cian or Chyrurgian, to lay a wholsome salve or plaster so on, that it doe no good, nay, rather that it doe hurt. Having therefore made a most soveraign salve out of the words of my Text for the sores of a wounded conscience, I am now to shew you how to use, and when to apply it; viz. in deliquio spiritus, in a spirituall desertion or dereliction. As wee sometimes feele in our bodies , deliquium animae, a trance and utter failing of the vi∣tall spirits; so is there also in the soule of a faithfull Christian sometimes deliquium spiritus, an utter fainting and failing in all the motions and ope∣rations of grace; when God either to humble him, that he be not proud of his favours, or to make him more earnestly desire, and highly esteeme the comforts of the Gospel, withdraweth the spirit from him for a season, du∣ring which time of spirituall desertion he lyeth as it were in a swoune, fee∣ling no motion of the spirit, as it were the pulse-beating, taking in no breath of life by hearing the Word, nor letting it out by prayer and thanks-gi∣ving, void of all sense of faith and life of hope, ready every houre to give up the holy Ghost. In this extremity we are to stay him with flagons, & com∣fort him with the apples in my Text, and as his fit of despaire more & more groweth on him, in this sort and order to minister and give them unto him.
1. When he lamenteth in the bitternesse of his soule after this manner: There was a time when the face of God shined upon mee, and I saw his blessing upon all that I set my hand unto; but now he hath hid his face from mee; and shut up his loving kindnesse in displeasure; hee bloweth upon all the fruits of my labours, and nothing prospereth with mee, my estate de∣cayes, and my friends faile mee, and afflictions and calamities come thicke upon me, likeS. Bas. de pati∣entia, conc. 13.  Job 1.14, 16, 17, 18. waves of the sea, riding one on the neck of the other, or like Jobs messengers, one treading on the heeles of the other, and the latter bringing still worse tidings than the former. Apply thou this remedy: Ma∣nyPsal. 34.18, 19. Matth 9.12. 1 Tim. 1.15. are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all: he keepeth all his bones, so that not one of them is broken. 2. If hee goe on in his mournfull ditty, saying; I am farre from being righteous: therefore this comfort belongeth not unto mee. Apply thou this salve: The whole need not the Physician, but they that are sicke. This is a faithfull saying, and by all meanes worthy to bee received, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.Matth. 9.13. I am not come, saith Christ, to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. 3. If hee reply: Oh but I cannot repent; for I am not able to master mine owne corruptions: Vitiis meis impar sum; I cannot shake off the sin that hangeth on so fast. I am like one in the mudde, who the more he strug∣gleth with his feet to get out, the deeper he sinketh, and sticketh faster in the mire. Apply this recipe: Yet bee of good comfort, because thou de∣lightest in the Law of God touching the inward man: thou strivest against all sinne, and because thou canst not get the upper hand of some of thy bo∣some corruptions, thy life is grievous unto thee. Thou cryest with the holy Apostle:Rom. 7.24. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver mee from this body of death? Thou hungerest and thirstest after righteousnesse: and, Blessed are they which hunger and thirst for righteousnesse;Matth. 5.6. for they shall be filled. 4. If hee sinke deeper into the gulfe of desperation, and say: I feele no such hunger nor thirst in me. Custome in sinne hath drawne a kall over my conscience, and I am not now sensible of any incision. Reach thy hand to him, and support him with this comfort: Bee of good cheare (good bro∣ther) for it is certaine thou hast some sense, because thou art sensible of thy stupidity, and mournest in thy prayers, and art vexed for this thy dulnesse: and blessed are they that mourne,Matth. 5.4. for they shall be comforted. 5. If he yet sinke deeper and lower, crying: Alas, I cannot mourne, my hard heart will not relent, my flinty eyes will not yeeld a teare for my sins: what hope then for me? Answer him, great; as great as thy sorrow, which is by so much the fuller, because it hath no vent. None grieveth more truly,Hierom. Tom. 1. epist. Mutus & clinguis ne hoc quidem habens, ut ro∣gare possit, hoc magis rogat quod rogare non potest. than hee who grieveth because hee cannot grieve. A man that is borne dumbe, or hath his tongue cut out, when hee maketh offer to speake, moving his lips, but is not able to bring forth a word, beggeth after a more effectuall manner, even because hee cannot utter his prayer by speech, his very dumbnesse pleads for him; so the sorrow of a peni∣tent sinner, which faine would expresse it selfe by teares, but cannot, which rendeth the heart continually, and maketh it evaporate into secret sighes, best expresseth it selfe to him of whom the Prophet speaketh:Psal. 38.9. Lord, thou
knowest all my desires, and my groaning is not hid from thee. 6. If he sink so low, that the pit is ready to shut her mouth over him, and he being now even swallowed up in the gulfe of despaire, breathe out his last sigh, and roares most fearfully, to the great dis-heartening of all that come about him, saying: I have no touch of remorse, no sense of joy, no apprehension of faith, no comfort of hope; My wounds stinke, and are pu∣trefied, and all the balme of Gilead cannot now cure mee. The Spirit is ut∣terly extinct in me; and therefore my case desperate. In this extreme fit of despaire give him this cordiall out of the words of my Text: Hast thou never felt any remorse of conscience in all thy life? Wast thou never pricked in heart at the Sermon of some Peter? Wert thou never ravished with joy, when the generall pardon of all thy sinnes hath been exemplified to thee in the application of the promises of the Gospel, and sealed to thee by the Sacrament? Hast thou never had any sensible token of Gods love? I know thou hast, & thou acknowledgest as much in confessing amongst o∣ther thy sins thine intolerable ingratitude towards the Lord that bought thee: then bee yet of good comfort, the flaxe yet smoaketh, the fire is not clean out; thou hast lost the sense, but not the essence of faith. Thou art cast out of Gods favour in thy apprehension, not in truth. Thou art but in a swoune, thy soule is in thee. Thou discernest no signe or motion of life in thee, but others may. Thy conscience will beare thee record, that sometimes thou didst truly beleeve, and true faith cannot be lost. Gods covenant of grace is immoveable, his affection is unchangeable, he whom God loveth, he loveth to the end; and hee whom God loveth to the end, must needs bee saved in the end: and so I end. And thus have I blowne the smoaking flaxe in my Text, and you see what light it affordeth to our understanding, and warmth to our conscien∣ces: what remaineth but that I pray to God to kindle in us this light, and inflame this heate more and more, to revive the spirit of the humble, to cheare up the drouping lookes, and cure the wounded consciences, and heale the broken hearts of them that mourne for their sinnes, that is, to beare up the bruised and bowed reed that it be not broken, and revive and kindle againe the dying lampe, that it bee not quite extinguished. So be it, O Father of mercy, for the passion of thy Sonne, through the Spi∣rit of grace: To whom, three persons and one God, bee ascribed all ho∣nour, glory, praise, and thanks-giving now and for ever. Amen.
THE STILL VOICE. A Sermon preached before the high Commis∣sion in his Graces Chappell at Lambeth, Novemb. 20. 1619. THE THIRD SERMON. MATTH. 12.19. Hee shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any man heare his voice in the streets. Most REVEREND, &c. IN these words we have set before us in the person of our Saviour an Idea and perfect image of meeknesse; the characters whereof are three: 1. Calmenesse in affection, He will not strive. 2. Softnesse and lownesse in speech, Hee will not cry, &c. 3. Innocency in action, He will not breake, &c. 1. Impatience is contentious, He will not strive. 2. Contention is clamorous, He will not cry. 3. Clamour is querulous, No man shall heare his voice in the street. If it be objected that he did strive, and that with such vehemency that he sweat bloud: and that hee did cry, and that very loud; for as wee reade (Hebr. 5.7.) he offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and teares, unto him that was able to save him from death: and that his voice was heard in the streets; when he stood up in the last day, the great day of the Feast,John 7.37. and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto mee and drinke: wee need not flye to Anselme and Carthusians allegory for the matter, who thus glosse upon the words of my Text: His voice shall not be heard in the streets, that is, in the broad way that leadeth to destruction. Such Delian divers may spare their paines: for the objections are but shallow, and admit of a very facile solution without any forced trope. Hee will not strive, viz. in revenge, but in love; he will not cry, in anger, but in zeale; neither shall his voice be heard in the street, viz. vox querelae, but doctrinae;
no voice of complaint, but of instruction or comfort. So that the three members in this sentence, are like the three strings in a Dulcimer, all Unisons. Wherefore in the handling of this Text, I will strike them all together. Seneca in his books of clemency,Cambden. hist. Reg. Eliz. Seneca l. 1. de clem. Condi∣tum, imò con∣strictum apud te ferrum, sit summa parsi∣monia etiam vilissimi san∣guinis, humili loco positis liti∣gare, & in rix∣am procurrere liberius est, le∣ves inter pares ictus sunt, regi quoque vocife∣ratio, verbo∣rumque intem∣perantia, non ex Majestate est. which Queene Elizabeth so highly esteemed, that shee gave them the next place to the holy Scrip∣tures, reades a divine Lecture to a Prince in these words: Let thy sword not onely be put up in the sheath, but also tyed fast in it; bee sparing of the mea∣nest and basest bloud. It is for men of lower condition to fall into quarrels and strifes, equals may exchange blowes one with another without much danger; it standeth not with the Majesty of a Prince to engage himselfe in any quarrell or fight: because he hath no equall to contend with him: so far ought it to be from a Prince to brawle, or wrangle, that the straining of his voice is unbefitting him upon any occasion whatsoever. What the wise Phi∣losopher prescribeth to a good Prince, the Prophet Esay describeth in our King Messias, who was so milde in his disposition, that hee was never stirred to passion; so gentle in his speech, that he never strained his voice in choler; so innocent in his actions, that he never put forth his strength to hurt any. We reade in the booke of1. Kin. 19.11, 12. Kings, that there was a mighty wind, but God was not in the wind: and after the wind an earth-quake, but God was not in the earth-quake: and after the earth-quake a fire, but God was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice, in which God was. There God was in the still voice; but here the Evangelist out of the Prophet infor∣meth us, that there was a small still voice in the Lord our Saviour Jesus Christ. For he strove not, nor cryed, nor was his voice heard in the streets. A still small voice naturally produceth no eccho. For as a ball layd softly on the ground boundeth not up againe; but if it be strook downe with a vehe∣ment stroake riseth from the ground again and again; so a low and whispe∣ring voice, which gently moveth the aire, is not returned againe by an ec∣cho: but a strong and a loud sound, which forcibly smiteth the aire, is re∣verberated from mountains & rocks by a double or treble eccho. Yet here a still small voice is returned by an eccho. For the words which I have read unto you in S. Matthew are no other than the eccho of the voice of the Pro∣phet Esay. As Esay of all the Prophets is most Evangelicall, that is, most plainly delivereth the story of Christ his life and death by way of predi∣ction; so S. Matthew of all the foure Evangelists is most Propheticall, that is, alledgeth most passages out of the Prophets in his Gospel. None so fre∣quently inserteth testimonies out of the Old Testament into his story as hee, which hee so pertinently applyeth, that in his Gospel every man may discerne the truth of that observation of the Ancients (viz.) that the New Testament is vailed in the Old, and the Old is revealed in the New. The Pro∣phets & Evangelists being the organs of the same holy Spirit, like divers instruments of musick playing the same tune, though in different keyes. Or rather like opposite looking-glasses, reflecting the same image one upon the other, to wit, the brightness of God his glory,Hebr. 1.2. & the expresse image of his per∣son. Or like thick & bright clouds on both sides of the Sun, which receiving the beams therof, & with them an impression of the similitude of that Prince of the celestiall lights, reflect the same one upon another, & make as if there were divers Sunnes in the sky, which are indeed but parelii pictures and
representations of the selfe same Sunne,Malach. 3.1. Esa. 42.1, 2, 3. the Sunne of righteousnesse. The Prophet Esay pointeth to the Messias, as it were afarre off, saying, Behold the servant of God whom he upholdeth, his Elect, in whom his soule delighteth, upon whom he hath put his spirit, he shall bring forth judgement to the Gen∣tiles; he shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets; a bruised reed shall hee not breake, and smoaking flaxe shall hee not quench, till hee bring forth judgement unto truth. The Evangelist viewing Christ neere at hand, findeth all those markes in him, by which the Prophet de∣scribeth him. Which you shall plainly descry, if you cast backe your eye on the story set down a little above my Text. There shall you find Christ stretching out his hand of mercy to a withered hand, and healing it on the Sabbath day, and the Pharisees murmuring at it, and conspiring against him for it. Against whom notwithstanding hee made no forcible resi∣stance, nor so much as opened his lips, but giving place to their wrath, lea∣veth that country; and though hee were so ill requited for his good deeds, and miraculous cures, yet he goes about still doing good in all places, hea∣ling their sicke, curing their blind, lame, and deafe, and withall charging them, that they should not make him knowne, That it might bee fulfilled, saith the Evangelist, &c. That it was fulfilled which God spake by the Prophet Esay, and how, it will evidently appeare, by comparing the pre∣dictions of the Prophet with the history of the Evangelist: Behold my ser∣vant, saith the Prophet. The sonne of man came not to bee ministred unto, but to minister,Matth. 20.28. Luke 23.35. Mat. 3. ver. ult. Luke 2.32. saith the Evangelist. Mine Elect, saith the Prophet. Christ the chosen of God, saith the Evangelist. In whom I delight, saith the Pro∣phet. In whom I am well pleased, saith the Evangelist. Hee shall bring judgement to the Gentiles, saith the Prophet. A light to lighten the Gen∣tiles, saith the Evangelist. Hee shall not strive, saith the Prophet Hee did not strive, saith the Evangelist; neither here with the Scribes and Phari∣sees, nor in the garden with them that sought his life; but contrariwise, when St. Peter drew a sword in his defence,Matth. 16.52, 53. and strooke off a servant of the high Priests eare, he rebuked him, saying, Put up thy sword, thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and hee shall presently give mee more than twelve legions of Angels? but how then shall the Scripture be fulfilled? He shall not cry,Mat. 27.14. Acts 8.32. nor lift up his voice, saith the Prophet. Hee was silent, and answered not a word, saith the Evangelist, but was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a Lambe dumbe before the shearer. A bruised reed shall he not breake, saith the Prophet. The Evangelist testifieth he did not. For the people which lay maimed and diseased, like bruised reeds upon the ground, he went not over, but raised them up; and the Scribes and Phari∣sees, whose malice smoaked against him, he did not destroy, or extinguish, when hee might as easily have done it, as tread out the weeke of a candle on the ground with his shooe. For hee came not to quench, but to kindle; not to destroy, but to save; not to launce, but to plaster; not to revenge, but to reconcile; not to punish, but to suffer; not to breake the bruised reed, but to be beaten and bruised with reeds and whips, yea and to be bro∣ken also upon the crosse. You have heard how this Text is inferred. Now in the second place listen what it inferreth both against the Jew, and for the Christian.
1. It inferreth for the reproofe of the Jew, that the first comming of the King Messias was to be private and silent, without any outward pompe or great noise. 2. For the instruction of Christians, that the members ought to bee conformable to the head, and frame their dispositions to his most sweet and gracious temper. 3. For the comfort of all, that the Judge of all flesh is meeke, milde, and mercifull to all that bow to him, or fall downe before him like bruised reeds. First, we have here the character of the true Messias, and the manner (if I may so speak) of his stealing into the world at his first comming. Where∣in judicious Calvin willeth us to observe the difference between the Mes∣siah and other Kings and Princes. They when they ride in progresse, send their Harbingers before to take up lodgings, and Martials to make way, and when they enter any City, it is with great noise and tumult, ringing of Bels, sound of Trumpets, peales of Ordnance, ratling of Speares, clattering of Coaches, and clamours of the People; but our King, the Prince of peace, entred the world in a far different maner. As in the buil∣ding of the materiall Temple there was not heard the noise of any toole; so neither in the building of the spirituall Temple, I meane the Temple of Christs body, and setting it up, was there any noise or sound heard.John 2.21. This privacy of his first entry into the world pleaseth not the carnall Jew, whose thoughts are all upon a temporall Monarch, that should buy out Croesus his wealth, and obscure Solomon in all his royalty, and extend his dominion as farre as the Sunne casteth his beames. No Messiah will please him, but such a one as comes in with great state and pompe: yet was Christ his quiet seizing upon his Kingdome most correspondent to the prediction of the Prophet,Psal. 72.6. He shall come downe like raine into a fleece of wooll, or upon the mowne grasse, that is, not heard, and most agreeable to his title and kingdome. For what more consentaneous to reason, than that the Prince of peace should enter upon his Kingdome of grace in a quiet and silent manner. Had hee come into the world like the two Scipio's, which were termed fulmina belli, with thundering and lightening, or like the Roman Emperours, or the grand Signiours, in the most pompous man∣ner, with greatest ostentation of wealth, and pride of worldly honour, more feared hee might have been, but lesse loved: there had been more state in his comming, but lesse merit for us; and consequently, lesse true comfort in it. The note that we are to take from it is, That Christs King∣dome is not of this World: And the use we are to make of it is, Not to looke for great estates, large revenues, or high preferments here; but to be con∣tent with a competency of meanes, not without a liberall allowance, some∣times of afflictions, crosses, and troubles. For delicate members, and such as must be continually wrapt in soft raiment, & that can endure no hardnesse, sort not well with a head crowned with thornes. By the Law, The feathers of such fowles as had been sacrificed, were cast in locum cinerum, into the place of ashes. What are all the pompes and vanities of this world, but like beautifull feathers? Projiciamus ergo in locum cinerum; Let us therefore strip us of them, and by true mortification cast them into the place of ashes,
especially in this time of sorrow and penance, when sackcloth is or should be in fashion for apparrell, and ashes for couches. Upon which when God seeth us, he will have compassion on us, and give us beauty for ashes, and the garment of gladnesse for the spirit of heavinesse.2 Cor. 5.7. Coloss. 3.3, 4. As we are Christians we walke by faith, and not by sight; our life is hid with Christ in God: and when Christ which is our life shall appeare, then shall we also appeare with him in glory. Secondly, we have here the picture of meeknesse in the pattern of all per∣fection,Matth. 21.5. Christ Jesus, drawne to the life for our imitation. What the Pro∣phet Zachary fore-told concerning the disposition and gracious temper of the Messias to come, saying: Tell the daughter of Sion, behold, the King commeth unto thee meeke,Zach. 9.9. &c. the same the Evangelist confirmeth through the whole Gospel, by the speeches and silence, actions and passi∣ons, life and death of the Lord of life. To begin with his speeches, if ever that Eulogue of the Greeke Poet, . or the like of the Latine; Vernas afflat ab ore rosas, were verified: if ever the tongue of any dropped honey, and his breath were as sweet and savou∣ry as Roses in the Spring, it was certainly our Redeemers, who is that hee spake, and speaketh alwayes that he is, the Word of God. The Father is as the mouth, the holy Spirit the breath, and Christ the word. Heare, I be∣seech you, verba Verbi, the words of the Word of life; Come unto mee all that are heavie laden, and I will ease you. Sonne, be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repen∣tance. The sonne of man came not to destroy, but to save. Goe in peace, thy sinnes bee forgiven thee. And, Come yee blessed of my Father, possesse the Kingdome prepared for you before the foundation of the world was laid, &c. Yea, but these speeches hee uttered to penitent sinners, or such as sued to him for favour and mercy; how did hee demeane himselfe towards those uncivill and inhumane Samaritans, who denied him lodging? Against whom James and John, the sonnes of thunder, were so incensed, that they would have called downe fire from heaven to destroy them, by the example of Elias. Doth he curse them? doth he upbraid ingratitude, and inhospitali∣ty unto them: nay, rather he rebuketh his Disciples, whom zeale and love transported too farre, and by telling them, they knew not of what spirit they were,Luke 9.55. he shewed apparently what spirit he was, who when the Scribes and Pharisees laid Sorcery and Necromancy to his charge, saying: Say we not well thou art a Samaritane, and hast a Divell? he delivered them not to the Divell, as they deserved for this their blasphemous slander, nor sharply reproveth them;John 8.49. but mildly answereth, I have not a Divell, but I honour my Father, and yee have dishonoured mee. Perhaps he pitied their ignorance, or had respect to the dignity and place of the Scribes and Pha∣risees, who bare the greatest sway among the people, may some say. But what was there in his owne Disciple Judas, that he should grace that dam∣ned caitiffe, that traiterous servant, that sonne of perdition, with the title of Friend, when he came to play the most unfriendly and ungratefull part that ever was acted, even to betray his Lord and Master? Friend, wherefore art thou come?Matth. 26.50. doest thou betray the sonne of man with a kisse? I have spoken
of the speeches of our Saviour, let me not passe in silence his meek silence, when he was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lambe before the shea∣rers, so opened hee not his mouth. When hee was falsly slandered in the Judgement seat, shamefully handled in the Hall, most contumeliously re∣viled, and cruelly tortured upon the crosse. When the Judge of all flesh was condemned, the beauty of Heaven spit upon, the King of glory crow∣ned with thornes, the Maker of the world made a spectacle of misery to the whole world. When his Disciples forsooke him, his owne Nation accused him, the Judge condemned him, the servants buffeted him, the souldiers deluded him, the people exclaimed against him, the Scribes and Pharisees scoffed at him, the executioners tormented him in all parts of his body. When the Starres were confounded with shame, the Elements troubled,Cypr. de bon. pat. Cùm confun∣derentur side∣ra, elementa turbentur, con∣tremiscat ter∣ra, nox diem claudat, sol ne Judaeorum fa∣cinus aspicere cogatur radios subtrahat, ille non loquitur, nec movetur, nec Majesta∣tem suam sub ipsá saltem morte profite∣tur; O qualis & quanta est Christi patien∣tia! qui adora∣tur in coelis, nondum vindi∣catur in terris. the Earth trembled, the Stones clave with indignation, the vaile of the Temple rent it selfe, the Heaven mourned in sables, the Sunne, that he might not behold such outrage done upon so sacred a person, drew in his beams. He who suffereth all this quatcheth not, stirreth not, nor discovereth his divine Majesty, no not when death approached. When all insensible crea∣tures seemed to be sensible of the injury offered their Maker; he who fee∣leth all, seemeth to be insensible. For hee maketh no resistance at all, and though he were omnipotent, yet his patience overcame his omnipotency, and even to this day restraineth his justice from taking full revenge of them who were the authours of his death, and of those who since crucifie againe the Lord of life, and trample under their feet the bloud of the Covenant, as a prophane thing. Whose thoughts are not swallowed up in admiration at this, that he who is adored in heaven, is not yet revenged upon the earth? You see meeknesse in his passions, behold now this vertue expressed to the life in his life and actions Actions, I say, whether naturall or miraculous, so in∣deed they are usually distinguished; albeit Christs miraculous actions were naturall in him, proceeding from his divine nature: and most of his natu∣rall actions, as they are called, proceeding from his humane nature, were in him wonderfull and miraculous. For instance, to weep is a most naturall action; but to weep in the midst of his triumph, and that for their ruine, who were the cause of all his woe: to shed teares for them, who thirsted after his bloud, was after a sort miraculous. Who ever did the like? In∣deed we reade that Marcellus wept over Syracuse, and Scipio over Car∣thage, and Titus over Jerusalem, as our Saviour did, but the cause was far different: They shed teares for them whose bloud they were to shed; but our Saviour for them who were ready to shed his.Luke 19.41. His bowels earned for them who thought it long till they had pierced his heart with a launce. When the high Priest commanded Paul to be smote on the face, hee rebu∣ked him, saying: The Lord shall smite thee thou painted wall:Acts 23 3. but when the Lord himselfe was smitten by the high Priests servant, he falls not foule upon him, but returnes this milde answer: If I have done evill,John 18.23. beare wit∣nesse of the evill; but if I have done well, why strikest thou me? The servant thinketh much to endure that from the Master, which the Master endures from the servant. The Apostles, on whom the Spirit descended in the likenesse of fiery tongues, were often hot, and inflamed with wrath against the enemies of God, and brought downe fearfull judgements upon them;
but our Saviour, on whom the Spirit descended in the likenesse of a Dove, never hurt any by word or deed.2 Kin. 5.27. Matth. 8.2. Luke 4.27. & 17.12. Acts 13.11. Acts 5.5.10. Eliah inflicted leprosie upon Gehazi by miracle. Christ by miracle cleansed divers lepers. Saint Paul tooke away sight from Elymas. Christ by miracle restored sight to many. Saint Peter miraculously with a word strucke Ananias and Sapphira down dead. Christ by miracle raised many from death, insomuch that his very enemies gave this testimony of him:Mark 7 37. Hee hath done all well, giving to the lame feet, to the maimed strength, to the dumbe speech, to the deafe eares, to the blind sight, to the sicke health, to the dead life, to the living everlasting joy and comfort. I have proposed unto you a notable example, shall I need to put to spurres of art to pricke on your desires to follow it? the example is our Saviour, and the vertue exemplified in him meeknesse. How excellent must the picture be which is set in so rich a frame? such a vertue were to be imitated in any person; such a person to be imitated in any vertue: how much more such a vertue in such a person? It is hard to say, whether ought to bee the stronger motive unto us to follow meeknesse, either be∣cause it is the prince of vertues, or the vertue of our Prince, whose stile is Princeps pacis. Where the prince is the Prince of peace, and the kingdome the King∣dome of grace, and the law the Law of love, they must certainly be of a milde and loving disposition that are capable of preferment in it. If the Spirit be an oyntment, as S.1. John 2.20. But you have an oyntment from the Holy One, and you know all things. John calleth it, it must needs supple. If grace bee a dew, it cannot but moisten and soften the heart, and make it like Ge∣deons fleece, Judges 6.37. which was full of moisture when all the ground about it was dry. What can be said more in the commendation of any ver∣tue than meeknesse; and of it, than this, that God commandeth it in his Word, Christ patterneth it in his life and death, the holy Spirit produceth it in our hearts, our very nature enclineth us to it, and our condition re∣quireth it of us? No vertue so generally commended as meeknesse. Fol∣low after righteousnesse,1 Tim. 6.11. godlinesse, faith, love, patience, meeknesse, bee no brawler,Tit. 3.2. but gentle, shewing all meeknesse to all men. Walke worthy of the vocation whereunto you are called, with all lowlinesse and meeknesse, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the uni∣tie of the Spirit in the bond of peace.James 3.17, 18. The wisedome that is from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easie to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, and the fruit of righteousnesse is sowne in peace of them that make peace. No fruit of the spirit so sweet and pleasant as this: as on the contrary, no fruit of the flesh so tart and bitter as jealousie and wrath, which God curseth by the mouth ofGenes 40.7. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce, and their rage, for it was cruell. Jacob; but blesseth meeknesse by the mouth of our Saviour, Matth. 5.5. Blessed are the meeke, for they shall inherit the earth. The earth was cursed before it brought forth thornes, and thistles, and briars, which are good for nothing but to bee burned. Wherefore let us hearken to the counsell of St.Cypr. de zelo & bore Evel∣lamus spinas de cordibus, ut dminicum se∣men nos fertili fruge locupletet. Cyprian: Let us weed out of our soules envie, wrath, and jealousie, and other stinging and pricking passions. And of the Apostle: Let no root ofHeb. 12.15. Looking diligently,—lest any root of bitternesse springing up trouble you. bitternesse remaine in us, that we may receive with meeknesse the engraffed Word, which is able to save our
soules, James 1.21. Our carnall lusts are like so many serpents, and of all, wrath is the most fiery, which will set all in a combustion, if it bee not ei∣ther quenched by the teares of repentance, or slacked by the infusion of divine grace, especially the grace of meeknesse, which in the heart is ten∣dernesse, in the disposition softnesse, in the affections temper, in the minde calmenesse, in the carriage sweetnesse. Aristotle briefly defineth it,Rhet. l. 2. . the Bridle of wrath; which because it is a passion of all other most head-strong, it requireth both a strong curb, and a skilfull rider, for whose direction the Spirit of God in holy Scripture hath set downe divers rules. The first rule is, not to be suddenly or easily provoked. This is laid downe for us by the Apostle St. James, Let every man bee swift to heare,James 1.19. slow to speake, slow to wrath. To follow this rule, it will be behoofull according to the advice ofHyper. citat. à Lips. Com∣ment. in Sen. de clem. l. 1. , &c. Hyperides, to prevent the occasion of quarrels, and stop the passages of wrongs, to nip the seeds of discords, because if anger take root, like an inveterate disease, it will hardly bee cured.Senec. l. 1. de clem. In primis finibus hostis arcendus est; nam cum por∣tis se intulit, modum à cap∣tivis non capit. Seneca strikes the same note, though on a different string: Above all things, saith hee, keep the enemy from entring the City: for if hee once thrust his head into the gate, he will give thee the law, and not take it from thee. Ovid giveth it as a character of a gracious Prince, to be tardus ad iram; Slow to wrath. Cer∣tainly, it is no strong piece that will suddenly bee out of frame: the bone was never well set, that easily slips out of joynt. A man full of juice and sap of grace is like green wood, which is long before it be kindled: they who easily take fire, seem rather to be annointed with brimstone, than the sweet oyntment of the spirit above mentioned. The second rule is, to tolerate some infirmities in others, as likewise o∣thers tolerate us in many things: for, as St. Austin speaketh; Toleramus, & toleramur, we tolerate, and are tolerated our selves:James 3.2. Galat. 6.2. because all offend in many things, and many in all. This rule is laid downe by St. Paul; Be are yee one anothers burthens, and so fulfill the law of Christ: in which words hee enjoyneth us not onely to beare light injuries, but those that are grie∣vous and burthensome; and the more burthens we beare in this kinde, the lesse we have upon our owne conscience. How can we expect that Christ should put his shoulders to our crosses, if wee withdraw our necke from his yoke? The third rule is, to consider the nature of our brothers temptation, and accordingly to deale with him. This is laid down by the Apostle:Galat. 6.1. If any man be overtaken in a fault, restore such an one in the spirit of meeknesse, consi∣dering thy selfe, lest thou also be tempted. Abraham lyed to Abimelech, Peter denied his Master, Job uttereth speeches of impatience, Paul an∣swereth very smartly to Ananias; The Lord smite thee thou painted wall:Acts 23.3. but this they did either transported in passion, or upon great provo∣cation, or out of feare, to save their lives. The greater the temptati∣on is, and the more forcible the assault of Sathan upon the frailty of our nature, the lesse the sinne is, or at least more pardonable. This sole con∣sideration moved Saint Cyprian to take pity on some of them, that in time of persecution denied their Master, and were therefore deservedly excommunicated, whom hee thus bringeth in pleading for themselves, not with teares, but with drops of bloud falling from their tortured
members:Cpr. de lapsis. Manabat pro¦ffetibs san∣guis. & pro la∣chrymis cot semstulatis viscetib de∣fluebt, sttit mens stabilis, & fide fortis, & cum torqenti∣bus pnis m∣mobilis d anima lactata est, sed cum du∣ssimi Judicis recrudescente saevituâ am fa∣tigatum corpus, nunc flagella scinderent, nunc contun∣derent fustes, &c. caro nos in colluctatio∣ne destruit. For a long time, say they, our resolution remained firme, and our faith strong, and we held out the fight against our tormenting paines: but when the malice and cruelty of the Judge was exasperated against us, and our savage tormentors fell afresh upon our wearied and worne-out bodie, some∣times tearing it with whips, sometimes bruising it with clubs, sometimes stretching it upon the racke, sometimes scorching it with fire, our flesh for∣sooke us in the conflict, the weaknesse of our bowels gave place, and our body, not our soule, was in the end overcome with the violence of paine. Beloved, you were never yet brought to the fiery tryall, that you might know how farre the extremity of torment might worke and prevaile upon the infir∣mity of your flesh: thanke God for it, and judge charitably of them, whose faith and constancy shone not so cleerly in the middest of the fire, but that they might be compared to the smoaking flaxe in the Verse following my Text. The fourth rule is, to admonish before we punish, and give warning before wee strike. This is laid downe byDeut. 12.10. Moses: When thou commest nigh to a City to besiege it, first offer conditions of peace to it. This course God hath most strictly kept, sending Noah to the old World, Moses and Aaron to Egypt, Lot to Sodome, Obadiah to Edom, Jonah to Nineveh, the old Prophets and Christ himselfe to Jerusalem, that they might prevent Gods judgements, by repenting them of their sinne; as the Ninevites had the grace to doe, who had certainly been destroyed, if destruction had not been threatned them by the Prophet. Whereat Saint Chrysostome standeth amazed, and in the end breakes out into this passionate exclama∣tion: O new and admirable thing! the denuntiation of death brought forth life; the prophecy of the overthrow overthrew the prophecy; the sentence of destruction made a nullity in the sentence. And if Jerusalem had knowne the things that belonged to her peace, even in that day in which our Savi∣our fore-shewed her fatall doome, his prophecy had fell, and the City had stood. For therefore God and man threaten to inflict severe punishment, that they may not inflict what they threaten; asPhil ct. l. 5. . Philostrates andNazian epist. 194. . Nazi∣anzen observe. The fifth rule is, first to use faire and gentle meanes before wee take a more severe course. This is laid downe by the Apostle (1 Corinth. 4.21.) What will you? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and the spirit of meeknesse? You see the soft drops of raine pierce the hardest stones, and the warme bloud of a Goat dissolveth the Adamant. Nature seemeth to prescribe this method, which alwayes sendeth a flash of lightening before we heare a clap of thunder; Et afflatur omne, priusquam percutitur: And nothing is struck, which is not blasted before. And Art also doth the like: Ovid. Met. l. 1.Cuncta priùs tentanda, sed immedicabile vulnus Ense recidendum est, ne pars sincera trahatur. Si frustra molliora cesserint,Seneca l. 1. de ir.ferit venam. For Physicians first minister weak and gentle potions, and as the disease groweth, apply stronger medicines. And good Surgeons,Homer. l. 1. .like Machaon in Homer, first lay plasters and poul∣tesses to wounds and swellings, and never launce or burne the part till the sore fester, and other parts be in danger: whom good Magistrates ought
to imitate, and never to use violent and compulsive remedies, but when they are compelled thereunto; nor to take extreme courses,Senec. l. 1. de ira. Ultima suppli∣cia motibus ul∣timis parat, ut nemo pereat, nisi quem peri∣re etiam pere∣untis intersit. but when the malady is extreme. Desperate remedies are never good, but when no other can be had: for they that are of a great spirit, if they be well given, will not; if they be ill, cannot be amended by such meanes. They resem∣ble Jeat, which burneth in water, but is quenched with oyle: or thePlin. nat. hist. l. 31. c. 7. Uno digito mobilis, idem si toto corpore impel∣litur resistens, ita ratio est li∣bra menti. Co∣lossus at Tarentum, which you may move with your finger, but cannot wagge, if you put your whole strength to it. As for those that are of a weaker spirit, and are easily daunted, harsh courses will doe them more hurt than good: for they resemble tender plants, which dye if they are touched with aRustici fron∣dibus teneris non putant ad∣hibendam fal∣cem, quia refor∣midare ferrum videntur, & ci∣catricem non∣dum pati posse. knife or iron instrument. The sixth rule is, to sweeten the sharpest censures with mild speeches. This rule is delivered by Lactantius, in these words: Circumlinere poculum coelestis sapientiae melle, when wee minister a wholsome, but bitter potion, to annoint the side of the cup with honey: when we give the patient a loath∣some pill, to lap it in sugar. The manner whereof the Spirit sheweth us in divers letters sent to the Churches ofApoc. 2.3. Asia. First, we are to professe the good will wee beare to the party, and make it knowne unto him, that whatsoever we doe, we doe it in love.Apoc. 3.19. I rebuke and chasten as many as I love. Secondly, to acknowledge their good parts, if they have any:Apoc. 2.2, 4. I know thy workes, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not beare them that are evill: neverthelesse I have somewhat against thee, be∣cause thou hast left thy first love. Thirdly, to give them some good ad∣vice and counsell with our reproofe:Apoc. 3.18. I counsell thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou maist bee rich; and white raiment, that thou maist be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakednesse may not appeare, and to an∣noint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou maist see. Lastly, to promise them favour upon any token of amendment:Apoc. 3.20. Be zealous therefore and repent: behold, I stand at the doore and knocke: if any man heare my voice, and open the doore, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. Some there are who like best a resolute Chirurgian, who, be the patient never so impatient, will doe his duty, and quickly put him out of his paine; though in the meane time he putteth the party to most intolerable torture. Give me a tender-hearted Chirurgian, who being to set an arme or legge that is out of joynt, handleth it so gently, that the patient scant feeleth when the bone falleth in. Thus Nathan the Prophet handled King David,2 Sam. 12.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and by telling him first a parable of a poore man that had but one lambe, &c. and afterwards applying it unexpectedly to the King himself ere he was aware, as it were set not his body, but his soule in joynt. The seventh rule is, to keep the execution of justice within certaine bounds, set by equity and mercy. This rule is laid downe by the Prophet Micah: Hee hath shewed thee, O man, what is good,Micah 6.8. and what the Lord re∣quireth of thee, to doe justice, and to love mercy: and by Solomon;Eccles. 7.16. Be not just overmuch. Cut not too deep, nor launce too farre; Ne excedat medi∣cina modum. It is better to leave some flesh a little tainted, than cut a∣way any that is sound. It is more agreeable to Gods proceedings to save a whole City for ten righteous mens sake, than after the manner of the Romans, when there was a mutiny in the Campe, to pay the tythe to ju∣stice,
by executing every tenth man through the whole Army. For as Germanicus cryed out in Tacitus,Tacit. annal. l. 1. Non medicina ista est, sed cla∣des. when hee saw a great number of souldi∣ers put to the sword for raising up sedition in the Army: Stay your hand, this is not an execution, but a slaughter; not a remedy, but a plague; not se∣verity of justice, but extremity of cruelty. For which Theodosius the Em∣perour was justly excommunicated by St. Ambrose, and Aegyptus sharp∣ly censured by the Poet: Ovid. l. 1. de Pont. Eleg 9.—qui caede nocentum Se nimis ulciscens extitit ipse nocens. And Scylla was proscribed by the Historians and Poets of his time to all ages, because hee was not content with the punishment of sixty thousand in Rome, who were executed with most exquisite torments; but entring afterwards into Praeneste, there left not a man alive: and else where also his cruelty raging in the end, as Lucan observeth, hee let out the corrupt bloud; but when there was in a manner no other bloud left in the whole body of the Common-wealth: Lucan. de bel. ci. l. 1.—periere nocentes, Sed cum jam soli poterant superesse nocentes. What was this else,Sabast. conjur. Cail. Vastae civitatem, non sanae. than as Salust speaketh, to exhaust a city, not to purge it? I am not against the cutting off a rotten member, to preserve the whole body. I know the sword is the only cure of an incurable wound, which yet hath no place, when there is no sound part in the whole body.Bodin. de rep. l 3. c 7. Et si sa∣lutare est putre membrum ad universi corpo∣ris salutem ure∣re, aut secare, non propterea si omnia mem∣bra extabue∣rint, at gan∣gena infician∣tu sectionibus erit aut ustioni∣bus utendum. Bo∣dine speaketh pertinently to this purpose: It doth not follow, that be∣cause it is good Surgery sometimes to burne out rotten flesh, or cut off a member to save the whole, that therefore if a gangrene overspread the whole, we are to apply a Razor or Cupping-glasse.Sen. deem. Poena ad pau∣cos, metus ad omnes perve∣niat. Seneca better advi∣seth: Let the clap fright all, the thunderbolt strike but a few. For asCassex Jan. Grat. not in Tac. Principi non minus turpia multa suppli∣cia, quàm me¦dico funera. Cassiodore noteth, It is as great a shame for a Magistrate, as for a Phy∣sician, to have many dye under his hand. Chuse therefore the fattest of the beasts for sacrifice, that is, make the chiefe authours and ring-leaders in any sedition or riot a sinne-offering for the rest, and an example unto all. This moderation Tully used in repressing the conspiracy ofSalust. in con∣jur Catil. Cataline:Quintus Cur∣tius de gest. Alex. Alexander in punishing the rebellion of the Articinae: Scipio in discipli∣nating his Army, as if they had all read that divine sentence ofSenec. l. 1. de clem. Divina po∣tentia est gre∣aum ac publice servare, multos occidere, & indiscretos, incendii & ruinae potentia est. Seneca, To kill men pell mell, and murder multitudes together, is liker a ruine of a house, or the devouring of a common fire, than a moderate execution of ju∣stice: but on the contrary, To save whole multitudes of men, and that to∣gether from death and destruction, is an eminent worke of the divine power. The eighth rule is, to be touched with aRom. 12.15. fellow-feeling of anothers misery. This is laid downe by S. Paul:Colos. 3.12. Weep with them that weep, put on the bowels of mercy, kindnesse, and meeknesse. A good Magistrate should not bee like the iron instruments of Chirurgians, that have no sense at all of the intole∣rable paine which they cause in the part pricked or launced; but like Za∣leuchus, who put out one eye of his owne, when hee sentenced his sonne according to law to lose both his eyes. It should bee a cut in their heart
to cut deep into any member of Christ Jesus. Why hath God given us soft hearts, but to melt into compassion? why moist eyes, but to shed teares, as well for others grievous affliction, as our owne sinnes? Teares, saith the Poet, are the most sensible, and best sensible parts we have; No∣stri pars optima sensus: and they that have sap of grace in them are fullest of them. .Eras. Adag. If Augustus never pronounced a capitall sentence, without fetching a deep sigh: If Marcellus wept before he set fire to Syracuse:Valer. Max. An∣te fuas lachry∣mas quàm ip∣sorum sangui∣nem effudit. If Scipio pro∣fessed in an Oration to his Souldiers, that he drew a sword through his own bowels, when he put thirty of them to death, to expiate the trespasse of eight thousand: Nay, if God himselfe, who is void of all passion, is yet full of compassion; At que dolet quoties cogitur esse ferox: If hee never pronounce the dreadfull sentence of destruction against any City or Country, without great regret and seeming reluctation,Hos. 11.8. How shall I give thee up, O Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, O Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.Vers. 9. I will not execute the fiercenesse of mine anger;—for I am God, and not man, &c. Beloved brethren, how should wee bee affected, when any of his children, our bre∣thren, are like to be ruined by our sentence? How loth should wee bee to draw bloud one from another, who are members one of another, and fel∣low-members of Christ Jesus? Were Christ againe upon earth, could you see him stripped stark naked, and flead with whips, and pierced with nailes, and racked on the crosse, and not bee pricked at heart with compunction, and wounded deeply with compassion? And doth hee not assure us, that whatsoever is done, bee it good or bad, to any of his little ones,Matth. 10.42. Acts 9.4. is done unto him? Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Therefore never look that he will have mercy on you in heaven, if you have no compassion on him here, cal∣ling for food in his starved, sighing for home in his banished, groaning for ease in his burthened, mourning for liberty in his imprisoned, crying for pity in his grievously afflicted and tortured members. I have applyed this Text to instruction and correction: now a word of comfort from this, that the Judge of all flesh is so meeke, as hath been shewed. When Benhadad the King of Syria was discomfited, and utterly overthrowne by the King of Israel, according to the advice of his servants, who told him that the Kings of Israel were mercifull,1 Kings 20.31, 32, 34. hee sent them clothed with sackcloth, with ropes upon their heads, to entreat for peace: now when the King of Israel saw their submission, he made a covenant of peace with them. Better advice I cannot give you, than to put in practise what they did: when you are overtaken with Gods judgements, and affrighted with hell torments, cast your selves downe to the ground before him, and poure out your soules with a showre of teares, and put ropes upon your heads, that is, acknowledge what you have deserved for your sinnes, and sue day and night for pardon, and in the end you shall finde by your owne experi∣ence,
that he that is over all is rich in mercy unto all that call upon him.Rom. 10.12. For he will not only raise you up, and set you upon your feet, and pull the rope off your neckes,Cant. 1.11. but will farther decke you with golden chaines of spiritu∣all graces linked together: hee will make you borders of gold with studs of silver. Nay, as when Tygranes threw first his crowne, and after himselfe downe at the feet of Pompey, that noble Commander, as Xiphiline wri∣teth,Xiph. in com∣pend. Dion. taking pity on him, put his Diadem againe with his owne hands upon his head, and after took him by the hand, raised him from the ground, and set him in a chaire of state by him: So the great Commander of heaven and earth, when he seeth your unfeigned humility, and lowest submission to him, will raise you up, put a crowne of glory upon your head, and set you in a throne of majesty on his right hand, to sit with him in judgement upon the twelve Tribes of Israel. So be it. To God the Father, &c.
THE LAMBE TURNED LION. A Sermon preached in his Graces Chappell at Lambeth, Decemb. 6. Anno Dom. 1619. before his Majesties high Commissioners there assembled. THE FOURTH SERMON. MATTH. 12.20. Till he send forth judgement unto victory. Most REVEREND, &c. THe words of Gedeon to the Ephraimites,Judges 8.2. (Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vin∣tage of Abiezer?) may not unfitly bee applyed to the written Word of God in comparison of other bookes. Is not the gleaning of Scripture better than the vin∣tage of all secular learning?Hierom. ad rustic. Eloquentiae torcularia non verborum pam∣pinis, sed sen∣suum quasi uvarum expres∣sionibus redun∣darent. For in these the presses of eloquence abound with leaves of words, and luxuriant stemmes of extravagant wit; but in it with spirituall senses and divine sen∣tences, as it were the juice and bloud of the ripest grapes of the Vine of En∣geddi. It is a point of wisedome in man, who hath but little, to make it goe as farre as he can; and so thriftily instill it in his workes, as Nature doth her influences in simples, a great quantity whereof is often distilled to extract one drop of pure quintessence: whereas on the contrary, no plant of Paradise, no branch of a plant, no flower of a branch, no leafe of a flower, but affordeth great plenty of the water of life, more precious than any quintessence that Art can force out of Nature. The finers of gold,Chrysost. tom. 5. homil. 37. as golden mouth St. Chrysostome teacheth us, deale not only with wedges, ingots, and massie pieces of gold, but with the smallest portions thereof. And the Apothecaries make singular use in divers confections even of the
dust of gold. When Alexander the great managed his affaires in Judea, those whom he imployed to gather the most precious oyle ofPlin. l. 12. nat. hist. c. 25. Succus è plaga manat, quem Opobal∣samum vocant, suavitatis exi∣miae, sed tenui gutta, Alexan∣dro magnores ibi gerente, to∣to dic aestivo unam concham impleri justum erat. Opobal∣samum, thought a whole Summers day well spent in filling a small shell, taking it as it fell drop by drop from the twigge. And if a skilfull Jeweller will not grind out a small spot, or cloud out of a rich stone, though it some∣what dimme the bright lustre thereof, because the substance is so precious; shall we lose, or sleightly passe by any Iota, or tittle of the Booke of God, which shall out-last the large volumes of the heavens? forMat. 5.18. heaven & earth shall passe away, but no one Iota or tittle of the Word of God shall passe. The Jewish Rabines say, that great mountaines hang upon the smallest Jods in the Bible. And St.Chrys. in Gen. . Chrysostome will not endure a devout Christian to let goe any syllable in the Scripture, no nor pricke, or point without obser∣vation. Surely, if God so carefully preserve the smallest parcels of Scrip∣ture, he would have us religiously observe them. Else if wee content our selves with a generall handling of the Word of life, how shall wee satisfie the Apostles precept of rightly dividing the Word of God?2. Tim. 2.15. Shew thy self a workman, that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth. The word in the originall is not , dichotomizing, (the Apostle tyeth no man to a precise Ramisticall method;) yet is it , rightly cutting, or dividing the Word of truth, which cannot be done, if any sensible part be omitted, be it but a conjunctive particle, as this Till in my Text, which stan∣deth like an hinge in the midst of the sentence, turning the meaning divers wayes. If it hath reference to the death and resurrection of our Saviour, as Cajetan & Avendanus conceive it hath, (in which he brought forth judge∣ment unto victory, by condemning the world, & conquering both death & hell) then the meaning of the whole is this, He shall not strive nor cry, &c. he shall not offer any violence to his enemies by word or deed, although he could as easily destroy them as a man may breake a reed already bruised, or tread out the smoaking week of a light ready to goe out of it selfe, yet he will not use this power, but contrariwise carry himselfe most meekly towards them, and by his mildnesse and patience both condemn their fury, and conquer their obstinacy. If it looke farther forward to the destruction of the City and Temple, and the overthrow of the whole Jewish Nation, as Theophylact and Mus∣culus imagine, expounding Till hee bring forth judgement unto victory, till he execute judgement upon them that judged him, and fully be reven∣ged of them by the sword of the Romans; then the meaning of the whole is, Hee shall not breake the bruised reed of the Jewish Nation, till by the victory of the Romans he shall execute judgement upon that Nation; nor shall he quench the smoaking flaxe of the Aaronicall Priesthood, till forty veeres after his death the City of Jerusalem shall bee sacked, and the Temple burned downe to the ground, and by the propagation of the Go∣spel, and prevailing thereof in all places, the dimme light of the Ceremo∣niall Law be quite extinguished. But if the word Untill carry us so farre as the last Judgement, to which St. Jerome, St. Hilary,Guilliand. comment in Mat. Qui diebus carnis suae vi∣sus est humilis & benignus doctor, aderit aliquando Ju∣de, & utetur potentiá abso∣lutâ, & damna∣vit hostes suos. Guilliandus, and many other learned Expositors referre it, then the whole beareth this tune: See you Jesus now in the forme of a servant, how humble and meeke he is, so farre from killing and
subduing his bloud-thirsty enemies by forcible meanes, that hee will not strive with them; so farre from lifting up his hand against them, that hee will not lift up his voice, Hee will not cry, nor shall his voice bee heard in the streets complaining against them; so farre from wounding the spirit,Cic. Catil. prim. Quos ferro vulnerare o∣portebat, non∣dum voce vul∣nerat. or hurting the bodies of any men, that hee will not breake a bruised reed, nor quench the smoaking flaxe. The time shall come, when you shall see this meek Lambe turned into a fierce Lion: He who cryed not upon earth, shall thunder from heaven: He who came now to suffer in meeknesse, shall hereafter come in power to conquer: Hee who came in humility to bee judged, shall come in Majesty to judge both quicke and dead: Hee who came by water and bloud; by water to wash our sinnes, and by bloud, to quench the fire of his Fathers wrath, shall one day come in flaming fire, to render vengeance to all that beleeve not the Gospel: He who in all his life never brake a bruised reed,Beza in Mat. c. 12. Tum re∣bellia corda confringet, non jam clemens & humilis, sed se∣verus, & maje∣state verendus. shall after his death and resurrection, when he commeth to Judgement, if not before, rule the Nations with a rod of Iron, and breake them in pieces like a potters vessell: Hee who here never quen∣ched the smoaking flaxe, hee shall hereafter put out the greater lights of the world: He shall darken the Sunne, and turne the Moone into bloud, and shake the powers of heaven, and foundations of the earth, and the hearts of men, and behold, he commeth with the clouds, and all eyes shall see him,Apoc. 1.7. even they that nailed him to the Crosse and pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth shall mourne before him, Yea and Amen: then he shall bring or send forth judgement unto victory. He brought forth judgement in his life, by preaching the Gospel in his owne person, and he sent it forth after his death, by the ministery of his Apostles, and doth still by propagating the Church: but hee bringeth not forth judgement unto victory in the Evangelists phrase; because this his judgement is much oppressed, the light of his truth smoothered, the pure doctrine of the Gospel suppressed, the greater part of the Kings of the earth, and Potentates of this world refusing to submit their scepter to his Crosse, and saying, as it is in St. Lukes Gospel,Luke 17.14. Wee will not have this man to reigne over us: but when the sonne of man shall display his banner in the clouds, and the winds shall have breathed out their last gaspes, and the sea and the waters shall roare; when heaven and earth shall make one great bonefire, when the stage of this world shall be removed, and all the actors in it shall put off their feigned persons and guises, and appeare in their owne likenesse; when the man of sinne,2 Thes. 2.3, 8. that exalteth himselfe above all that is called God, shall be fully revealed, and after consumed with the spi∣rit of Christs mouth, and be destroyed by the brightnesse of his comming: then he shall suddenly confound the rest of his enemies, Atheists, Hypo∣crites, Jewes, Turkes, Idolatrous Gentiles and Heretikes, and breake the neckes of all that stubbornly resist him, and then the truth shall universal∣ly prevaile, and victoriously triumph. All this variety of descant which you heare, is but upon two notes, a higher and a lower, the humility and the majesty, the infirmity and the power, the obscurity and the glory, the mildnesse and the severity of our Lord and Saviour; his humility upon earth, his majesty in heaven; his infirmities in the dayes of his flesh, and his power since hee sitteth at the right hand of his Father; the obscurity
and privacy of his first comming, and solemnity of his second: his mild∣nesse and clemency during the time of grace and mercy, and his wrath and severity at the day of Judgement and Vengeance. Ecce, tibiâ cecinimus vo∣bis; Behold, out of this Scripture, I have piped unto you, recording the plea∣sing notes of our Redeemers mildnesse and mercy, who never brake the bruised reed, nor quenched the smoaking flaxe: now I am to mourne unto you, sounding out the dolefull notes of his justice and severity, which shall one day bring forth judgement unto victory. But before I set to the sad tune, pricked before mee in the rules of my Text, I am to entreat you to listen a while till I shall have declared unto you the harmony of the Prophet Esay, and the Evangelist S. Matthew; the rather because there seemeth some dissonancy and jarre between them. For in Esay we reade,Esay 42.3. Hee shall bring forth judgement unto truth, that is, give sentence according to truth; but in St. Matthew, He shall send forth judge∣ment unto victory, which importeth somewhat more than  (viz.) that the judgement he shall send forth, viam inveniet aut faciet, shall ei∣ther finde way or force it, take place or make place, no man or divell being able to withstand it. Besides this discord in their notes, there is a sweet straine in the Prophet (he shall not faile,Verse. 4. nor bee discouraged, till hee have set judgement on the earth) left out in the Evangelist. To the first excepti∣on the Jesuit Maldonat saith, that the Syriack word signifieth both truth and victory, and that Saint Matthew wrote not in pure Hebrew, but in the Hebrew then currant, which was somewhat alloyed and embased with o∣ther languages; which if it were granted unto him, as it is not by those who defend that the Greeke in the New Testament is the originall, yet the breach is not fully made up. For still the originall Hebrew in Esay, and the Greeke in Saint Matthew, which hath been ever held authenticall, are at odds:  in Hebrew signifying truth, and  in the Greeke signify∣ing victory, and not truth. I grant the truth of Christ is most victorious, and hath subdued all the false gods of the Heathen, as the Arke laid Dagon on his face, and the rod of Aaron devoured all the rods of the Magicians: yet truth and victory are not all one. A weake Judge may bring forth judgement unto truth, yet not unto victory; as on the contrary a potent and corrupt Judge may bring forth judgement unto victory, yet not unto truth. Tully in a bad cause prevailed against Oppianicus, by casting dust in the Judges eyes. And Aeschines prevailed not against Ctesiphon in a good cause. Right is often overcome by might, and sometimes by the sleight of a cunning Advocate for the false part. To the second objection Beza an∣swereth, that these words, that hee will not faile, nor be discouraged, till he hath set judgement on the earth, were anciently in St. Matthew, but of late, through the carelesnesse of some transcriber, from whose copy ours were drawne, are left out. But sith this Verse is wanting in all the copies of Saint Matthew now extant, neither can Beza bring good proofe of any one in which this Verse was ever found, it is not safe to lay any such imputation upon the first transcribers of St. Matthewes Gospel, whereby a gap may be opened to Infidels and Heretickes to cavell at the impeachable autho∣rity of the holy Scriptures in the originall languages. A safe and easie way to winde out of these perplexed difficulties, is to acknowledge, that the
Evangelist, who wrote by the same spirit wherewith the Prophet Esay was inspired, tyed nor himselfe precisely to the Prophets words; but fit∣teth the Prophets sense to his owne purpose, and what the Prophet deli∣vered in two Verses, he contracteth into one. For what is hee shall bring forth judgement unto truth, and he shall not faint nor be discouraged, till hee hath done it; but that he shall doe it effectually and powerfully? and what is that but he shall send forth judgement unto victory? Hee shall send forth.Cal. in Mat. 1. Hoc verbum educere quo utitur Prophe∣ta, significat of∣ficium Christi esse Regnum Dei, quod tum inclusum erat in angulo Ju∣deae propagare in totum or∣bem. This phrase reacheth forth unto us a twofold ob∣servation; the first touching the extent, the second touching the freedome of this judgement here spoken of. By judgement is here meant the King∣dome of Christ, which must not bee confined to Jury, nor bounded within the pale of Palaestine: but hee sent forth, that is, propagated and spread over the whole world, according to the prophecy of the Psalmist,Psal. 110.2. The Lord shall send a rod of thy strength out of Sion: be thou ruler in the middest of thine enemies. Whilst our Saviour lived upon earth, the soveraigne bal∣samum of wounded mankind yeelding a savour of life unto life, was kept as it were in a narrow boxe; but at our Saviours death the boxe was broken, and this precious oyntment poured out, and the whole world filled with the smell thereof. This doctrine touching the naturalizing (if I may so speak) of the Gentiles into the spirituall Common-wealth of Israel, was im∣plyed in the Metaphor of the Rose of the field;Cantic. 2.1. I am the Rose of the field (Christ is not a garden flower, for few to see, and fewer to smell unto; but a Rose of the field, for all to gather that have a hand of faith to touch him): but it was unfolded at large to Saint Peter in a vision of a sheet let downe from Heaven, knit at foure corners,Acts 10.11, 12. in which were all manner of foure footed beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, &c. The foure corners of the sheet signified the foure parts of the world, all sorts of living creatures, all sorts of men, of all kindreds, nations, and lan∣guages. The sheet in which they were all wrapped is the Church militant. In the end of the vision the vessell was received up againe into heaven,Acts 10.16. to shew, that in the end of the world the whole Church militant shall be tran∣sported into heaven, and become triumphant. St.Orig. com∣ment. in Cant. homil. 1. Quemadmo∣dum in Evan∣gelio mulier illa quae san∣guine fluebat, archi Synago∣gae filiam cura∣tione praevenit; sic Aethiopissa, id est, Gentium Ecclesia, Israel aegrotante sa∣nata est. Origen representeth this truth most cleerly unto us through the mirrour of an allegory; Though (saith he) the found of the Gospel came later unto the Gentiles, yet the Gen∣tiles prevented the Jewes in giving credit to it, and were justified before them; as the woman in the Gospel, that was sicke of a bloudy issue, was healed before the Rulers daughter. The daughter of the Ruler of the Synagogue, was a type of the Jewish Synagogue; the woman that was in a long con∣sumption by reason of her continuall fluxe of bloud, was an embleme of the people of the Gentiles, lying more than twelve ages sicke of a bloudy issue, weltring in her naturall filth and bloud. Now, as Christ, going to cure the Rulers daughter, was touched by the Canaanitish woman sicke of a bloudy issue, and she by that touch was cured; so though Christ came first to heale the Synagogue, yet the Gentile Church touching the hemme of his garment by faith, is first healed and saved. The phrase of sending forth judgement, expresseth our Saviours readi∣nesse in opening the treasures of heavenly wisedome, and unfolding the mysteries of eternall salvation;  till he shooteth out, casteth out, or
sendeth forth judgement of his owne accord, as a tree doth his fruit, or the Sunne his beames.Matth. 12.35. A good man bringeth forth out of the treasure of his heart good things.Matth. 2.11. The Sages opened their treasures, and every Scribe which is instructed unto the Kingdome of heaven, is like unto a man that is an house-holder, which bringeth forth out of his treasures things new and old. I have not hid thy righteousnesse within my heart,Psal. 40.10. saith David in the person of Christ, I have declared thy faithfulnesse and thy salvation: I have not con∣cealed thy loving kindnesse and thy truth from the great congregation.Ver. 9. I have preached righteousnesse in the great assembly, I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest. And according to this fore-going type, how ready the truth himselfe was to publish the Gospel of the Kingdome, appeareth by his taking all occasions from every ordinary occurrent, to instruct his Di∣sciples in points of heavenly wisedome; as from a draught of fish to admo∣nish them of fishing for soules: from Well-water, to treat of the water of life: from barly loaves, to exhort them to labour for the food that peri∣sheth not: from burying the dead, to reprove those that are dead in sinne: from curing the blind in body, to rebuke the spirituall blindnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees: from a question concerning the materiall Temple, to fore-tell the dissolution of the temple of his body, and raising it up againe in three daies. To conceale any needfull, especially saving truth, is to bury the gold of Ophir, and thereby deprive not only others, but our selves also of the benefit and use thereof. Wherefore St.August l. 12. confess. Veritas nec mea, nec tu, nec illius est, sed omnium nostrûm quos ad ejus com∣munionem publicè vocas, admonens nos ut nolimus eam habere priva∣tam, ne prive∣mut ea. Augustine sharply censureth such as would challenge a peculiar interest and propriety in that which is the common treasure of Gods Church, saying: The truth is neither mine, nor thine, nor his, but all ours in common, whom thou, O Lord, callest pub∣likely to the communion thereof, dreadfully admonishing us, not to desire to have it private, lest we be deprived of it. In speciall, the truth of judgement ought not to bee kept in, but to bee sent forth. For to detaine any private mans goods, is but a private wrong; but unrighteously to detaine justice, which is the Kings, or the Common-wealths, or rather both their good, is a kind of peculatus, or publike theft. We laugh at the Indians for casting in great store of gold yeerly into the river Ganges, as if the streame would not runne currently without it: yet when the current of justice is stopt in many Courts, the wisest Soliciters of sutes can finde no better means than such as the Indians use, (by dropping in early in the morning gold and sil∣ver into Ganges) to make it runne. Pliny reporteth of Apis the Aegyptian god (whom they worshipped in the likenesse of a Cow or Oxe) that hee gave answers to private men, è manu consulentium cibum capiendo, Taking alwayes some food from their hands, otherwise the Oracle was dumbe. I need not to prosecute the application in this place, where, by the testimo∣ny of all men, and the truth it selfe, the streame of Justice (if any where) runneth cleerly, most free from all filth and corruption. Therefore I passe from Christ his sending forth judgement to his victory. Hee shall send forth judgement unto victory. There are two principall acts, or to speake more properly, effects of our Lords Princely function,  and , judgement and victory; judge∣ment upon, and victory over all his enemies: Wee have them both in the words of my Text, Judgement which hee shall send forth, and
Victory unto which. But of what Judgement or Victory the words are to bee construed, the learned Interpreters of holy Writ somewhat differ in judgement. Some in their ghesses fall short upon the particu∣lar judgement and utter overthrow of the Jewish Nation by Vespasian, and his sonne Titus. Others deferre the accomplishment of this prophecy, till the dreadfull day of the Worlds doome, when by the shrill sound of the Archangels Trumpet all the dead shall bee awaked, and the son of man shall march out of Heaven with millions of Angels to his Judge∣ment seat in the clouds, where hee shall sit upon the life and death of man∣kinde. That day, saith SaintAugust. l. 20. de civitate Dei. Ille dies judicii propriè dicitur, eo quod nullus erit ibi imperi∣tae querelae lo∣cus, Cur inju∣stus ille sit foe∣lix, & cur ju∣stus ille infoe∣lix? Austin, may bee rightly called a Day of Judgement, because then there shall bee no place left for those usuall ex∣ceptions against the judgements of God, and the course of his providence on earth, viz. Why is this just man unhappy, and why is that unjust man hap∣py? Why is this profane man in honour, and that godly man in dis∣grace? Why doth this wicked man prosper in his evill wayes, and that righteous man faile in his holy attempts? Nay, why for a like fact doth some man receive the guerdon of a crowne, and another of aJuvenal. Satyr. Sceleris preti∣um ille cru∣cem tulit, hic diadema. crosse or gibbet? the one of a halter, the other of a chaine of gold? These and the like murmurs against the justice of the Judge of all flesh shall bee hushed, and all men shall say in the words of thePsal. 58.11. Psalmist, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth. And then Christ may bee said properly to bring or send forth judgement, when hee revealeth the secrets of all hearts, displayeth all mens consciences, and declareth the circumstances of all actions, where∣by all mens judgements may bee rightly informed in the proceedings of the Almighty, and all men may see the justice of God in those his most secret and hidden judgements, at which the wisest on earth are asto∣nished, and dare not looke into them, lest they should bee swallowed up in the depth of them. I speake of those judgements of God, which SaintAugust. lo. sup. cit. Dies decla∣rabit ubi hoc quoque mani∣festabitur, quàm justo Dei judicio fi∣at, ut nunc tam multa, ac penè omnia justa Dei judicia sensus mentem∣que mortalium fugiant, cum ta∣men in hac re¦piorum fidem non lateat ju∣stum esse, quod latet. Austin termeth Occuliè justa, and justè occulta; Secretly just, and justly secret: so they are now; but at the day of Judgement they shall bee manifestly just, and justly manifest; then it shall appeare not onely that the most secret judgements of God are just, but also that there was just cause why they should bee secret, or kept hidden till that day. Lastly, then Christ may bee said properly to bring forth judgement unto victory, because hee shall first conquer all his enemies, and then judge and sen∣tence them to everlasting torments. Of which dreadfull Judgement, en∣suing upon the glorious Victory of the Prince of peace over the great Whore, and the false Prophet, and the Divell that deceiveth them all; from which the Archangel shall sound a retreat, by blowing the last trump, and summoning all that have slept in the dust to arise out of their graves, and come to judgement, I need not to adde any thing more in this Religious and Christian auditory. Wherefore I will fill up the small remainder of the time with some briefe observations upon the ruine and utter desola∣tion of the Jewish Nation, who even to this day wandring like Vagabonds in all countries, and made slaves not only to Christians, but to Moores, Turkes, and other Infidels, rue the crucifying of the Lord of life, and the spilling of the innocent bloud of the immaculate Lambe of God, that ta∣keth
away the sinnes of the World. As according to the custome of our country, Quarter-Sessions are held in Cities and Shire-townes, before the generall Assises; so Christ a little more than forty yeeres after his death at Jerusalem, and ascension into Heaven, held a Quarter-Sessions in Jerusalem for that country and people: after which hee shall certainly keep a generall Assises for the whole world, when the sinnes of all Nations shall be ripe for the Angels sickle. Some of the wisest of the Jewish Rabbins entring into a serious con∣sideration of this last and greatest calamity that ever befell that people, together with the continuance thereof more than 1500. yeeres, and ca∣sting with themselves what sinne might countervaile so heavie a judge∣ment, in the end have growne to this resolution, that surely it could be no other than the spilling of the Messias bloud, which cryed for this venge∣ance from heaven against them. And verily if you observe all the circum∣stances of times, persons, and places, together with the maner and means of their punishments, and lay them to the particulars of Christs sufferings in and from that Nation, you shall see this point as cleerly set before your eyes, as if these words were written in letters of bloud upon the sacked walls of Jerusalem, Messiah his Judgement and Victory over the Jewes. 1. Mocking re∣paid.1. Not full sixe yeeres after our Lords passion, most of those indig∣nities and disgraces which the Jewes put upon him, were returned backe to themselves by Flaccus, and the Citizens of Alexandria, who scurri∣lously mocked their King Agrippa in his returne from Rome, by inve∣sting a mad man, called Carabbas, with Princely robes, & putting a reed in his hand for a Scepter, & saluting him, Haile King of the Jewes. Note here the Jewes mocking of Christ repaid unto themselves: yet this was not all.Whipping re∣paid. The Alexandrians were not content thus scornfully to deride the King of the Jewes, they proceeded farther to make a daily sport of scourging many of the Nobility, even to death, and that, which Philo setteth a Tra∣gicall accent upon, at their solemnest Feast. Note here the Jewes whipping and scourging Christ upon the solemne Feast of Passover repaid unto them. 3. Spitting re∣paid.3. And howsoever their noble and discreet Embassadour Philo made many remonstrances to the Emperour Caligula of these unsufferable wrongs offered to their Nation; yet that Emperour, because the Jewes had refused to set up his Image in the Temple, was so farre from relieving them, or respecting him according to the quality he bare, that he spurned him with his foot, and spit on his face. Note here the Jewes spitting on Christ repaid them. 4. The Jewes re∣fusing Christ to be their King, to flatter the Ro∣mane Caesar, re∣vened on them by Caesar himself.4. In conclusion, the Emperour sent him away with such disgrace and discontent, that hee, turning to his country-men, said: Bee of good cheare, Sirs, for God himselfe must needs right us now, sith his Vicegerent, from whom wee expected justice, doth so much wrong us, and contrary to the law of all Nations most inhumanely, insolently, and barbarously useth mee, employed as a publike minister of state for our whole Nation. But all this in vaine; these wrongs fell right upon them. It was just with God, that they who in disdaine of his Sonne cryed out, Wee have no King but
Caesar, should finde no favour at Caesars hands, and much lesse at Gods, before whom they preferred Caesar.Baron. annal. Noluerunt flo∣rem, nacti sunt Florum praesi∣dem. They would none of the flower of Jesse, they cast him away: therefore God in justice after the former trou∣bles, sent them by Nero's appointment Deputy Florus,The Pharisces envie at the peo∣ples crying▪ Ho∣sanna to Christ, punished. who robbed their Church treasury to raise a rebellion, & after put them to the sword for this rebellion: received money of them to save them from spoile, and spoiled them the more for it; insomuch that the Scribes and Pharisees, and chiefe Rulers, who rebuked the people for bringing in Christ to Jerusalem with branches of palmes, and happy acclamations of Hosanna to the sonne of David, Hosanna in the highest, are now forced to bring out all the trea∣sures of the Temple, and Priestly ornaments, by them as it were to adjure the people, and beseech them even with teares to march out of Jerusalem in seemliest order, and with expressions of joy to meet and greet the Ro∣mane souldiers, who requited their salutations with scornes, and their gifts with pillaging them. Note here the Jewes envie at Christs triumphant riding into Jerusalem punished. 6. I beseech you observe the circumstances of time, persons, and place, and you shall perceive that divine Justice did not onely make even reckonings with them in every particular of our Saviours sufferings, but also kept the precise day and place of payment. Galilee, wherein Christ first preached, and wrought so many miracles, first of all suffers for her unbeliefe, and is laid waste by Vespasian. The infinite slaughter at Jeru∣salem, began with the high Priest Ananus his death, whom the Zelots slew in the Temple: Sanguine foedantem quas ipse sacraverat aras. A lamentable sight, saith Josephus, to see the chiefe Priest, a little before clad with sacred and glorious vestments, richly embroidered with gold and precious stones, lye naked in the streets, wallowing in dirt, mud, and bloud; to behold that body which had been annointed with holy oyle, to bee torne with dogges, and devoured by ravenous and uncleane fowle; to looke up∣ the Altar in the Temple polluted with the bloud of him, who before had hallowed it with the bloud of beasts. But so it was most agreeable to divine Justice, that that order (though never so sacred) should first and most dreadfully rue our Lords death, whose envie was first, and ma∣lice deepest in the effusion of his most innocent bloud. Who can but take notice of that which the Histories of those times, written by Jewes as well as Christians, offer to all readers observation? viz. That the Jewes, who escaped out of Jerusalem, and fell into their enemies quar∣ter, because they were thought to devoure downe their money and jew∣els, that the Romane souldiers might not finde them about them, were in great numbers after they were slaine, rippedTheir giving money to Judas to betray him, repaid. and bowelled; and that besides those Jewes crucified by Flaccus, whose deathPhilo in legat. Alii die festo mortuos de crucibus de∣traxerunt, at hic, non mortuos de crucibus, sed vivos in crucem sustulit. Philo so much bewailed, because the execution was done upon them at their great Feasts, without any regard to the solemnity of the day: there were so many in this last siege of JerusalemTheir crucifying him repaid with advantage. crucified on the walls every day, that there
wanted in the end crosses for mens bodies, and spaces for crosses. Note here their price of bloud given to Judas to betray his Master, as also their cru∣cifying the Lord of glory, was repaid with advantage. Crucified they are in their persons (for some of them that conspired Christs death might live till this time) or in their children and nephewes by hundreds, who cryed to Pilate when hee would have freed Christ, Away with him, away with him; Crucifie him, crucifie him. Their bloud is shed for money, who gave money to betray innocent bloud; and shortly after thirty of them are sold for a piece of silver, who bought his life at thirty pieces of silver. As wee have compared persons and actions, or rather passions; so let us now parallel times and places. Titus began to besiege Jerusalem, as Caesar Baronius exactly calculateth, upon the day in which our Savi∣our suffered: hee surveyed the City on MountTheir contempt of Christs teares, Olivet, whence our Savi∣our before viewing it, wept over it. And now the Jewes have their wish against their wills, theirand their cursing revenged. Matth. 27.25. owne curse is returned to their bosome, viz. His bloud bee upon us and our children. For so indeed it was, in such a man∣ner and measure, as never before was heard or seene. Besides those that fled out of the City, which were either crucified upon the walls, or slaine by the gates, when Titus made a breach into the City, hee saw all their streets paved in a manner with carkeises, and caemented with bloud: yea, their channels ran with gore so full, that the best meanes they could think of, or use to quench the fire of the Temple, was the bloud of the slaine. And now Jerusalem which had been so free inTheir stoning Gods Prophets, and spilling inno∣cent bloud, repaid. casting stones at the Pro∣phets, and killing them that were sent unto her, (to exhort them to repen∣tance unto life, and shewed before of the comming of the Just One, of whom these later Jewes had been the betrayers and murderers) hath not one stone left upon another in her,Acts 7.52. but is made even with the dust; nay, nothing but dust,Sutton. de Tiber. and , dirt leavened with bloud, the just tem∣per of that Tyrants complexion, in whose reigne the Lord of glory was crucified. What other conclusion are wee to inferre upon these sad premisses but this, that it is a most fearfull thing to provoke the Lion of the Tribe of Ju∣dah? Who shall bee able to stand before him in the great day of his wrath, from whose face the heaven and the earth fled away,1 Pet. 2.7. Mat. 21.42, 44. and their place could no where be found? The stone which the builders refused, is now become the head of the corner. Take heed how yee stumble on it, or lift at it; Whosoe∣ver shall fall on this stone shall be broken, but upon whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grinde him to powder,Vid. mag. de burg. sub. finem. Cent. prim. & Baron. annal. tom. 1. as it did Herod, and Pilate, and Annas, and Caiaphas, and all that were accessary to the death of the Lord of life. And not only those that committed high treason against the sacred person of the Lords Annointed, and imbrued their hands, and stained their conscien∣ces with that bloud which cleanseth us from all sinne;1 John 1.7. but also Nero, and Domitian, and Trajan, and Antoninus, and Severus, and Maximinus, and Decius, and Valerianus, and Dioclesianus, and Maxentius, and all other Emperours that employed their swords; and Simon Magus, and Cerin∣thus, and Arrius, and Nestorius, and Manes, and all other obstinate arch-Heretickes, who employed their pens against him: none have hitherto
escaped the heavie judgement of God, who have bid battell to the Chri∣stian Faith, and have wilfully, and of set malice given the Spouse of Christ the least wound or skarre, either by a gash with their sword, or a scratch with their pen. Bee wise now therefore, O yee Kings:Psal. 2.10, 11, 12. bee instructed yee Judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trem∣bling. Kisse the Sonne, lest hee bee angry, and yee perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: blessed are all they that put their trust in him. Some Interpreters by Judgement understand the spirituall govern∣ment of Christ, which is managed in his Church with excellent wisedome and judgement; and by Victory, the prevalent power of grace in the faith∣full, wherby they are victorious in all temptations, in such sort, that though Sathan labour with all his might to blow out a poore sparke, yet hee shall not be able to quench it: and that the smallest degree of faith, like a grain of mustard seed, is stronger than the gates of hell, and is able to remove mountaines of doubts and oppositions cast up by Sathan, and our rebellious hearts, between God and us. And from hence they inforce the Apostles exhortation to all the souldiers of Christ, to be strong in the Lord,Ephes. 6.10. and in the power of his might; not to looke who are their enemies, but who is our Captaine; not what they threaten, but what hee promiseth, who hath ta∣ken upon him, as to conquer for us, so to conquer in us. These are sweet and comfortable notes, but, as I conceive, without the rule of this Text: for questionlesse the Donec, or Untill, is not superfluous, or to no purpose; but hath reference to some future time, when Christs mild proceedings shall be at a period, and he shall take another course with his enemies, such as I have before described in the particular judgement of the Jewish Nati∣on, and the generall judgement of the whole World. But if Judgement and Victory bee taken in their sense, there needed no untill to bee added. For Christ even from the beginning of his preaching, when he strived not, nor cryed, nor brake the bruised reed, nor quenched the smoaking flaxe, sent forth judgment unto victory, according unto their interpretation, that is, wise∣ly governed his Church, and gave victory to the faithfull in their conflicts with sinne and Sathan. That therefore the members of this sentence bee not co-incident, and that the donec or untill may have his full force, I con∣ceive, agreeably to the exposition of the ancient, and the prime of the la∣ter Interpreters, that in this clause, Till hee bring forth judgement unto vi∣ctory, the Prophet determineth the limits of the time of grace. Whosoe∣ver commeth In between the first and second comming of Christ shall be received into favour, but after, the gates of mercy shall bee locked up. Yet our gracious Ahasuerus reacheth out his golden Scepter to all that have a hand of faith to lay hold on it; but then he shall take his Iron mace or rod in his hand, to bruise his enemies, and breake them in pieces like a potters vessell. I must sing therefore with holy David, of Mercy and Judgement; mercy in this life, and judgement in the life to come: mercy during the day of grace, but judgement at the day of the Worlds doom. For although sometimes God meets with the Reprobate in this life, yet that judgement which they feele here may bee accounted mercy in comparison of that which shall be executed upon them hereafter, without all mitigation of fa∣vour,
release of torments, or limitation of time. Now the vials drop on them, but then they shall bee poured all out upon them. Wherefore let us all, like the bruised reed, fall downe to the earth, and humble our selves un∣der the mighty hand of God. Let us, like smoaking flaxe, send forth bitter fumes of sighes for our sinnes, assuring our selves, that now whilst the day of grace lasteth, hee will not breake the bruised reed, nor quench the smoaking flaxe: but if we neglect this time of grace, and deferre our repentance, till he send forth judgement unto victory, we shall smoake for it. Cogitemus fratres de tempore in tempore, ne pereamus cum tempore; Let us thinke of time in time, lest we perish with time. Let us imagine that we now saw the Angel standing upon the sea,Apoc. 10 5, 6. and upon the earth, and lifting up his hand to heaven, and swearing by him that liveth for ever, who created heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the things that are therein, that there should be time no longer.Jonas 2.8. O let us not forsake our owne mercy, but to day if wee will heare his voice, harden not our hearts, but mollifie them, by laying them asoake in teares. Let us breake off our sinnes suddenly by repentance, and our iniquities by almes-deeds. Now is the seed-time, let us now there∣fore sow the seeds of faith, hope, mercy, meeknesse, temperance, patience, and all other divine Vertues, and we shall reape a plentifull harvest in hea∣ven.Cypr. ad Dom. Hic vita aut a∣mittitur aut te∣netur, hic saluti aeternae cultu Dei, & fructu fidei provide∣tur. Galat. 6.8. For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reape corruption; but hee that soweth to the spirit, shall of the spirit reape life everlasting. Which God of his infinite mercy grant that we may all do in heaven, through the merits of his Sonne, by the grace of the holy Spirit: to whom, &c.
THE TRAITORS GUERDON. A Sermon preached on the Gowries conspiracy before his Grace, and divers Lords and persons of eminent quality, at Croydon, August 5. Anno Dom. 1618. THE FIFTH SERMON. PSAL. 63. VER. 9, 10, 11. 9. But those that seeke my soule to destroy it, shall goe into the lower parts of the earth. 10. They shall make him run out like water by the hands of the sword: they shall be a portion for Foxes. 11. But the King shall rejoyce in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speake lyes shall be stopped. Most REVEREND, Right Honr. Right Worsh. &c. WEe are at this present assembled with religious Rites and sacred Ceremonies, to celebrate the unfortunately fortunate Nones of August, which are noted in red let∣ters in the Romane Calendar (as I ghesse) to represent the bloud of many thousand Martyrs spilt upon them: (twenty three whereof were put to most exquisite tor∣ments by Dioclesian in Rome) but deserve to be distin∣guished from other dayes by golden letters in ours, in memory of two of the most renowned Princes that ever swayed Scepter in these Kingdomes wherein wee live; the one received life, the other escaped death on this day. ForBed. & Baron. in Martyrolog. mens. August. Beda and Baronius in their Church Rolls of Martyrs, record on the fifth of August the nativity of King Oswald; who united theWhich were af∣ter severed for many ages, but ow by the speci∣all providence of Almighty God againe lye loving∣ly, encompassing and embracing each the other. Crownes of England and Scotland, and after hee had much enlarged the bounds of Christs Kingdome with his owne, in the end exchanged his Princely Dia∣dem
for a Crowne of Martyrdome, and signed the Christian Faith with Royall bloud. So happy an uniter of the Royall Diadems, and Princely Martyr of our Nation, should not be forgotten on this day; yet may hee not every way compare with our Rex Pacificus, who hath so fastened these Diadems together, that we hope they shall never be severed againe. Nor is the birth of any Prince by the usuall course of Nature so remarka∣ble, as the unheard of, and little lesse than miraculous preservation of our Soveraigne his Royall person, from the bloudy assacinate of the Earle Gowry, and Alexander Ruthen his brother, to the everlasting memory whereof our Church hath consecrated the publike and most solemne de∣votions of this day. And therefore wee are now to change the old spell, Quintam fuge, and , that is, Carefully shunne the fifth day, into Quintam cole, Religiously observe the fifth day of this Moneth; if not for King Oswald, yet for King James sake: if not for the birth of the one, yet for the safety of the other: if not for the ordinary Genesis and entry of the one into the gate of life, yet for the extraordinary Exodus, or exit of the other out of the chambers of death. Which wonderfull delivery of our gracious Soveraigne that I may print the deeper in your memories, I have borrowed characters from King Davids royall presse as you see: But those that seeke my soule, &c. Ver. 9, 10, 11. All which Verses, together with their severall parts and commaes, even to the least Iota or tittle, by the direction and assistance of Gods holy Spi∣rit, I will make use of in my application, if I may intreatHere he bowed to his Grace. your Gracious patience, andHere he turned to the Lords. your Honourable attention for a while in their explication. And first of the translation, then of the relation of these words, as well to the eternall destruction of the enemies to Christs Crosse, as to the tem∣porall punishments of the traitors to Davids Crowne. They shall goe into the lower parts of the earth, these shall goe into the nethermost hell. They shall fall by the hands of men, these shall fall into the hands of the living God. They shall be a portion for Foxes, these shall he a prey for Divels. But the King shall rejoyce in God, David in Christ, Christ in his Father. And all that sweare by him, that is, Christ, to him, that is, David, shall glory. For the mouth of all that speake lyes against the one, blasphemies against the other, shall be stopped. The vulgar Latine, upon which the Romane Church so doteth, that she is in love with the errours thereof, asCic. de orat. Naevus in pue∣ro delectat Al∣ceum, est defor∣mitas in vultu, illi tamen lu∣men videbatur. Alceus was with the wirts in his boyes face, rendereth the Hebrew thus: Quaesiverunt in vanum ani∣mam meam, introibunt in imâ terrae; They have sought my soule in vaine, they shall goe into the lowest parts of the earth. Of which words in vanum
inserted into the Text, I may say as Aristotle doth of the ancient Philoso∣phers discourseAristot. Phys. auscust. c. de Vacuo. . de vacuo, of a supposed place voide of a body to fill it. Their disputes, faith he, of this void or empty space, are empty, void, and to none effect. For neither are they found in any originall copy, as is confes∣sed, neither serve they as artificiall teeth to helpe the speech, which soun∣deth better without them: yet Cardinall Bellarmine to helpe out the vul∣gar Interpreter, with an officious lye beareth us in hand, that his book was otherwise pointed than ours are, and that where we reade  he reades  as if Leshoath and Leshava, the one signifying to destroy, the other in vaine, differed no more than in prickes or vowels, and not in consonants and radicals; or the sense were so full and currant, they seeke my soule in vaine, as they seeke my soule to destroy it, or for the ruine or destruction thereof they shall goe to the lowest parts of the earth, that is, they that seek to overthrow me, and lay mine honour in the dust, they shall lye in the dust themselves. They shall fall by the sword. So wee reade in the last translation, and the members of the sentence seeme better to fall and shoot one in the other, if we so reade the words, They shall fall by the edge of the sword, they shall be a portion for Foxes, than if we reade according to the Geneva Transla∣tion, They shall cast him downe with the edge of the sword, they shall bee a portion for Foxes. Yet because Calvin, Moller, Musculus, Tremelius, and Junius concurre with the Geneva Translation & Note, understanding these words as a speciall prophecy of Sauls death, who was Davids capitall and singular enemy; and this translation and exposition fitteth better the appli∣cation which I am to make of this Scripture to the present occasion: but especially because the Hebrew Jaggirhu signifieth as the last Translators rightly note in the margent, They shall make him runne out like water by the hand of the sword, that is, his bloud shall be spilt by the sword; I pre∣ferre the Geneva Translation before the last; and as the Macedonian wo∣man appealed from Philip to Philip, so I appeale from the Translators in the Text, to themselves in their Marginall note, and reade the tenth Verse thus: They shall cast him downe, or slay him with the edge of the sword. Thus having accorded the Translations, I now set to such heavenly lessons, as the Spirit of God hath pricked for us in the rules of this Scrip∣ture. The first is pricked in the title of this Psalme, (A Psalme of David when hee was in the wildernesse of Judah) and it is this: 1. That the wildernesse it selfe may be, and is often a Paradise to the ser∣vants of God. If the Poet could say of himselfe and his friend, Quo cunque loco Roma duobus erit;Martial. epigr. Wheresoever wee two are, wee make that place as Rome to us: have wee not great reason to thinke, that wheresoever God and the faithfull soule are together, and the one enjoyeth the presence of the other, there is Pa∣radise, nay, there is Heaven? This sweet flower I gather from this wil∣dernesse, to which David was driven by the pursuit of Saul his dreadfull and powerfull enemy. It was a vast and wilde place, a thirsty land without water, verse the first: yet here David is refreshed with waters of comfort,
and rivers of pleasure: there was neither Church nor Chappell in it; yet here David seeth the glory of God as in the Sanctuary, verse the second. It was a barren soile, yeelding no manner of sustenance for men or cattell; yet here David is satisfied as with marrow and fatnesse, verse the sixth. It was a hot and scorching place; yet here David findeth a shade to coole himselfe, (viz.) under the shadow of Gods wings, verse the eighth. In regard of which commodities of this wildernesse, I cannot but breake out into the praises of it, as SaintHierom. epist. ad Heliodor. O Desertum, Christ flori∣bus vernans! O Solitudo, in qua illi nascun∣tur lapides de quibus in Apo∣calypsi civitas magni Regis extruitur! O Eremus, famili∣arús Deo gau∣dens! Quàm diu te tectorum umbrae pre∣munt? quàm di fum sarum u bium ca cer includit? nescio quid hic plus lucis aspicio. Jerome doth into the commendations of the De∣sart of Syria: O Wildernesse, enameled with the flowers of Paradise! O Desart, in which those stones grow, of which the heavenly Jerusalem is built! O solitude, enjoying the familiarity of God and his Angels! Why doest thou keep under the shade of houses? Why doest thou shut thy selfe up in the pri∣son of smoaky Cities? come hither to mee, thou shalt finde here freer aire, and much more light. Such pleasure this holy Father took in that solitary and uncouth place. And SaintHilar. con. Auxent. Malè vos parietum amor cepit, montes mihi, & sylvae, & so∣litudines, & la∣cus, & voragi∣nes sunt tutio res; in illis e∣nim Propherae aut demersi, aut manentes Dei Spiritu prophe∣tabant. Hilary seemeth to be in love with the like places, by those speeches of his: You doe ill to dote upon walls, to build your faith upon stately buildings. I for my part preferre hills and woods, desarts and dens, and caves, and rockes, and lakes, for these have been the habita∣tions and lodgings of Gods dearest servants the Prophets. The Law was first given in the Wildernesse of Arabia. The Gospel was first preached by John the Baptist in the Wildernesse of Judeah. The noblest duell that ever was fought, was between Christ and the Divell, and the pitched field was the Wildernesse. The woman that was clothed with the Sunne, and had the Moone under her feet, lived obscurely in the Wildernesse a thousand, two hundred, and sixty dayes: and many of Gods dearest children all the daies of their life, Apoc. 12.6. The number of whom was so great, and their labours so profitable, and their lives so admirable in the Primitive Church, that as the Prophet spake of the barren woman, that she had more children than she that had an husband; so we may say of the barren soile and wildernesse, that it hath brought forth a greater increase to the Church than many inhabited coun∣tries, and better husbanded land. There are divers sorts of plants and fruits, that must be set in the Sunne, or else they will not prosper; but o∣thers are scorched with the heate thereof, and better thrive in the shade: such were PaulusVid. Hieron. in ita Paidi, & Hilarionis; & Marianum. Vi∣ctorinum in vita sancti Hieronomi. Eremita, St. Antony, St. Hilarion, St. Basil, S. Jerome, St. Isidore Pelusiotes, and others, which proved the fairest flowers in the garden of the Church, and prime-roses of Christs Spouse, yet grew in the Wildernesse: with whom the Bishops of the greatest Sees may not com∣pare, least of all the Bishops of Rome, of whom their owne creaturePlatina in vi∣tis Pontif. Hic Pontifex nihil memoriâ dig∣num reliquit: hic pontifex, nisi podagram habuisset, om∣nind ignorare∣tur. Pla∣tina hath often nothing to say, but that he can say nothing: This Pope, saith he, left nothing behind him worth memory. Well fare this Popes gout, but for it he had gone out of the world without any notice taken of him.Baron. tom. 10. ad ann 900. Intrudebantur in Petri sedem meretricum Amasii pseudo-Pontifices, qui non sunt, nisi ad consignanda tempora in Ca∣talogo Romanorum Pontificum scripti. Baronius himselfe, who received a Cardinals cap, to burnish the Popes triple golden Mitre, reckons himselfe up a dicker of Popes, who served for nothing but as ciphers to fill up the number of Bishops, or Chronologicall markes to designe the times. But I am affraid, lest I shall lose my selfe in this Wil∣dernesse
of Ziph; and therefore I will make haste out of it, and come into the rode of my Text. They that seeke my soule to destroy it, shall goe, &c. Davids confidence in God in this Epitasis of all his troubles, and Crisis of all his affaires, and the height of his hope in the depth of misery, ought to settle fast the anchor of our hope in all the surges of tentations. Wee see in him what is the carriage of Gods Saints in their greatest extremi∣ties. They never cast away the buckler of their faith, but lift up their hearts and hands to the God of their salvation, and hope even above hope in him, who is able to save beyond all means. Thus resolute Martin Luther, when he had stirred up the whole world against him, and there was no o∣ther appearance, but that the doctrine of the Gospel should have been stifled in the cradle, flyes to his God, layes hold on him by faith, and offe∣reth violence unto him by prayer, and never leaveth wrestling with him, till he received comfort from him, and rising up chearfully from his devotion, comes out of his closet triumphantly to his fellow-labourers, saying: Vicimus; We have overcome: at which timeSleidan in com. sui temporis. Vicimus. Sleidan observeth, that there came out a Proclamation from Charles the fifth, that none should bee far∣ther molested for the profession of the Gospel. What speake I of a noble Champion of Christ? Numa Pompilius a Heathen King of the Romans, when newes was brought him of his enemies, that they were at hand rea∣dy to surprize him, put the messenger off with this memorable speech:Plutarch. a∣poph. & in vit. Numae. , What tell you me of dangers or enemies? doe you not see that I am about sacrificing to God? Numa his confidence was paralleled byRaleigh hist. of the World. c. 6. lib. 3. Pausa∣nias the Lacedemonian Generall, who at Platea, when his Army was over∣taken by the enemies horse, and overwhelmed with flights of arrowes; as thicke as haile, quietly sate still, not making any defence or resistance, till the sacrifices for victory were happily ended; yea, though many were hurt and slaine before any good signe appeared in the enirals. But as soon as he had found good tokens of victory, he arose, and with excellent cou∣rage received the charge of the Persians, slew Mardonius that commanded in chiefe, and many thousands of the Barbarians. Did Heathen Religion put such courage, and breed such confidence in the worshippers of Idols, that they feared no danger while they were about their superstitious rites? and shall not true Religion beget more noble resolutions in us, who have God bound by promise to deliver us, when we faithfully crave his succour and assistance? Will he not glorifiePsal. 51.15. himselfe by delivering us in time of trou∣ble, who calleth upon us, to call upon him, to this end: Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorifie mee? Where∣fore, as the Athenians, when they were in greatest danger at sea, accusto∣mably cast out the great anchor called the holy Anchor. WhenceEras. adag. ex Lucia. Sacram Anchoram sol∣vere dicimur, quando ad ex∣tremum praesi∣dium confugi∣mus. grew the Proverbe, ; so when wee are tossed with waves of persecution, and so overwhelmed with violence of tentation, that wee are ready to sinke in despaire, let us lift up our hands to God, and cast anchor in heaven; and though wee see no meanes at all to subsist, yet still hang upon Gods providence. It is scarce possible, that wee should bee put to a greater plunge than David was in this wildernesse, who having but a hand∣full of men, and most of them hunger-starved, or fainting for want of wa∣ter
to quench their thirst, was surrounded by Sauls royall Army; yet in this deplorate, and almost desperate estate, after parley with God by pray∣er, shall I say he conceived hope of delivery? nay, hee assureth himselfe of the Crowne, and in a manner insulteth over his enemies, as if they were already under his feet, saying: They that seeke my soule to destroy it, shall go into the lowest parts of the earth. They shall cast him, &c. that is, they that goe about to cast mee downe from my high throne of Majesty, shall fall low themselves; they who seeke to devest mee of my royall Purple and Diadem, shall bee clothed with confusion as with a garment: they who hunt after me, and would make a prey of me, shall be themselves a portion for Foxes: they that seeke my soule to ruine it, shall downe themselves; They shall cast him downe.  These words in Hypothesi containe a prophecy of Sauls bloudy end, and the desolation of his Army on the mountaines of Gilboa; but in Thesi, a generall judgement of God upon the wicked, whom he entangleth in their owne malice, and punisheth with their owne sinne, and bringeth to confusion by their owne order. Hesiod.  l. 1. Sibi ipsi mala fabricat homo, qui alteri fabri∣cat, & malum consilium con∣sultori pessi∣mum. Which Verses of the prophane Poet may be thus translated, and they be∣come sacred Oracles: ThePsal. 7.15, 16. ungodly shall be trapped in the works of his own hands: he made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which hee made; his mischiefe shall returne upon his owne head, and his violent dealing shall come downe upon his owne pate. For it is just with God to mete to the wicked their owne measure, as he did to the accusers of Shadrach, Mesach, and Abednego, who were burned in the fire of that furnace which they had caused to beDaniel 3.22. heat seven times more than ordinary for those three noble Confessors. And to the traducers of Daniel, who were cast to the Lions, which they keptDaniel 6.24. fasting, on set purpose, that they might make but one morsell of the Prophet. And toEster 7.10. Haman, who had the honour to bee hanged on that high gallows, to which he would have preferred Mordecai. And toJudges 1.7. Adonibezeck, who when his thumbes were cut off by Judah, beshrewed his owne fingers, saying: Threescore and ten Kings, having their thumbes and great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: As I have done, so God hath requited mee. All ages yeeld examples in the like kinde, insomuch that the Heathen themselves have taken notice of Gods using the wickeds mete-wand, to measure out their own ruine. Thraseus in∣structing Busirus how to expiate the wrath of the gods, by the effusion of strangers bloud, was first himselfe sacrificed, and constrained to write a probatum est under that conclusion with his owne bloud: Ovid. de art. l. 1.Cum Thraseus Busirin adit, monstratque piari hospitis effusi sanguine posse deum; Illi Busiris, fies Jovis hostia primus inquit, & Aegypto tu dabis hospes aquam. What Puny in the Schooles hath not read Ovids golden Motto upon Perillus his brasen Bull: Ovid ibid. Et Phalaris tau∣ro violenti membra Peril∣li, Torruit infoe∣lix, imbuit au∣thor opus.—nec enim lex justior ulla est, Quàm necis artifices arte perire suâ. There can be no juster law, than that the devisers of mans ruine should rue
their owne devices, and that the inventers of new deaths should dye by their owne inventions. ScironPlutarch. in Theseo. the Giant, that sate upon the cleft of a high rocke, and kicked downe all that scrambled up to it into the sea, was him∣selfe served in the like manner by Theseus, who comming behind him, push't him downe with his foot into the deep. And Termerus, who had a strange fashion of beating out mens braines, by playing at hard head with them, in the end met with his match at that barbarous sport, and lost the little braine he had, his skull being broken by Hercules. What should I re∣late the tragedy of an agent of PopeBeno Cardina∣lis devita & gest Hildeb. Hildebrands, who standing upon a planke in the roofe of a Church in Rome, and taking up a huge stone to cast down upon the Emperour, when he was at his devotion, by the waight of the stone and his owne, the planke brake under him, and hee fell downe into the floore, having his braines struck out by the rowling of that stone upon him? Or of Laurentius Medices, who having fitted a flesh-baite forBodin l. 4. de rep. Alexander Medices, and as he was greedily catching at it, being naked and disarmed, set a desperate villaine, in the habit of a Masquer, to stabbe him with a Stilletto; and himselfe was shortly after stilletoed at Venice, by a suborned Traitor at a Masque, in the habit of a Whiffler? The ancient Ro∣mans glanced at this retaliation in their sacrifices to Ceres and Bacchus, to whom they offered Swine and Goats, because these of all creatures most annoy corne and wine: Ovid. fast. l. 1. & Martial l. 13. cui nomen Xen. Lascivum pe∣cus & viridi non utile Bac∣cho, dat poenas, no∣cuit nam tener ille Deo.Prima Ceres avidae gavisa est sanguine porcae ulta suas meritâ caede nocentis opes. Rode caper vitem, tamen hinc cum stabis ad aras, in tua quod spargi cornua possit, erit. I will not charge your memory with more examples at this present than of PopeBodin. l. 6. de rep. Alexander the sixth, who was poysoned in that very cup, through a mistake, and with that very potion, which he prepared for the Cardinals of the opposite faction: and of theSuet. in Jul. Caes. conspirators against Julius Caesar in the Senate, who most of them were slaine with the same daggers numero, wherewith they had stabbed him before: and of Saul, who fell upon that sword of his, which he sought to draw through Davids bowels; as he here prophesieth of him: They shall cause him or his bloud to run out like water by the hand of the sword, (viz.) his owne sword. And they shall be a portion for Foxes. Beasts were given to men for their food,Unnaturall pu∣nishment for unnaturall crimes. but here men are given to beasts for a prey. A lamentable spectacle to see the vilest of all creatures ra∣venously feast themselves with the flesh of the noblest; and irrespectively hale and teare in pieces the casket, which whilome inclosed the richest jewell in the world. Is it not against the law of Nature, that men should become beasts meat; yea, the meat of such beasts as are carrion, and not mans meat? Questionlesse it is: yet Nature giveth her consent to this kind of punishment of unnaturall crimes. For it is consonant to reason, that the law of Nature should be broken in their punishment, who brake it in their sinne; that they who devoured men like beasts, should bee devoured of beasts like men: that they, who with their hands offered unnaturall vio∣lence
to their Soveraigne, should suffer the like by the clawes and teeth of wilde beasts, their slaves: that they, who bare a Foxe in their breast in their life, should been tombed in the belly of a Foxe at their death. SaintAugust in Psal. 62 Jud ei ideo voluerunt Christum cci∣dere ne terram perderent; ideo terram perdiderunt, quia Christum occiderunt: quia repulerant Agnum, & ele∣gerunt Vul∣pem, ideò prae∣da Vulpium facti sunt. Austin, expounding this whole prophecy of Christ, yeeldeth a speciall reason of this judgement of God, by which the Jewes were con∣demned to Foxes. The Jewes, saith hee, therefore killed Christ, that they might not lose their countrey; but indeed they therefore lost their countrey, because they killed Christ: because they refused the Lambe, and chose Herod the Foxe before him, therefore by the just retribution of the Almighty, they were allotted to the Foxes for their portion. Notwithstanding this allusion of Saint Austin to Foxes in speciall, Jansenius and other Expositors extend this grant in my Text to all wilde beasts and fowles, which are, as it were, in patent with the Foxe, and have full power and liberty given them to seize upon the corps of Traitors to God and their Country. But Foxes beare the name, because they abound in those parts, where was such store of them, that Sampson in a short time with a wet finger caught three hun∣dred, so that upon the matter, they shall be a portion for Foxes, is all one with that doome in theHom. Il. 1. Poet: —, . They shall be exposed to the teeth of every cruell beast, and to the bill and talons of every ravenous fowle. I might insist upon the severall branches of this Scripture with delight and profit, but because the occasion of our meeting at this present is ra∣ther to offer unto God the fruits of our devotion for his Majesties and our enemies destruction, than to gather fruits of knowledge from Scripture for our instruction; I descend from the generall explication of the whole, to the particular application of the parts: and first, I will shew you how this prophecy, according to the severall members thereof, was accomplished in Christ Davids Lord, then in David the Lords Christ, and last of all in King James our David. Saint Austin, Saint Jerome, Arnobius, and almost all the ancient Inter∣preters of this propheticall Psalme, understand the letter spiritually of Christ; on the other side, Calvin, Musculus, Mollerus, and others under∣stand the spirit literally of David. I know no reason why we may not spell them together, and of two make one perfect and compleat interpretation of this Scripture. Wherefore to avoid vaine jangling, where the golden bels of Aaron may bee orderly rung, and distinctly heard; for the literall exposition, I accord with the later Interpreters, yet beare a part with the Ancients in their spirituall descant upon the ground of the letter; the rather, because David is a knowne type of Christ: and therefore by the law of con∣traries, Saul and his host of Sathan or Antichrist, and their infernall troups; but especially, because (asCalin. epist. ad Fran. gallo. reg. Nusquam legi∣mus reprehen∣sos quod nimi∣um de fonte aquae vivae hauserint. Calvin piously observeth) that wee never read of any blamed for drawing too much water out of the Well of life; so it is most certaine, that we cannot offend in ascribing too much honour to the King of glory. Then take the cliffe as you please, the notes will follow according∣ly; if you take it higher from Christ, thus the notes follow: They that seek my soule to destroy it, that is, Herod and Pilate, Scribes and Pharisees, Ru∣lers
and people that conspire against the Lord, and against his annointed, to take away his life from the earth, they I say shall goe into the lowest parts of the earth; that is, the nethermost hell, without repentance: they shall make him run out like water; that is, Pilat, who in discontent was driven to slay himselfe; as also did Saul, to whom the letter pointeth: or, as we reade in my text, They shall fall by the edge of the sword; that is, the Nation of the Jewes shall fall by the sword of the Romans: who shall make such a slaugh∣ter of them at Jerusalem, where they crucified Christ, that the channels shall run with gore bloud, and the streets be strowed with dead carkasses, left unburied for a prey to the fowles of heaven, and every ravenous beast: but the King, viz. the King of glory, and Prince of Peace, Christ Jesus, shall rejoyce in God, and triumph at the right hand of his Father; and every one that sweareth by him, and putteth his trust in him, shall glory in these his victories. But the mouth of all Jewes and Gentiles, Turkes and Infidels, A∣theists and Idolaters, that belch out blasphemies against him, shalbe stopped when he shall come in the glory of his Father, with his elect Angels, and sit in judgement upon quicke and dead.Hieron epist ad Heliod.

Then thou poore and simple countrey swaine shalt leap for joy, and say, Behold my God who was crucified, behold the Judge who sometimes wrapt in swadling clothes cryed in a manger: this is the Carpenters sonne, this is he who borne in his mothers armes being God fled from man into Aegypt: this he who was clad in purple, and crowned with thornes: see O Jew the hands which thou nailedst: view O Roman the side which thou diggedst with thy speare: behold O Jew the head which thou prickedst with thornes, now compas∣sed with radiant beames: behold the face thou defiledst with spittle, shining brighter than the Sun: behold the hands thou woundedst with Iron nailes, holding a rod of Iron, and bruising his enemies like a potters vessell: behold O Roman the naked side which thou piercedst with a speare, now guarded with a troupe of Angels with their polaxes: behold the body thou strippedst starke naked, cloathed with light as with a garment. In a word, behold him whom thou esteemedst the scorne of the earth, made now the glory of the hea∣vens, in a triumphant march, with millions of Saints and Angels, riding on bright clouds, as it were fiery chariots, through the aire, to execute speedie vengeance upon all his enemies, and to take up all the elect with him into heaven:Apoc. 22.20. Etiam sic veni Domine Jesu; Even so come Lord Jesu, come quickly. You have heard how sweet and heavenly the musicke is, if you take the highest cliffe from Christ; if you take the middle from David, thus the notes follow; They that seeke my soule to destroy it, that is, my bloud-thirsty ene∣mies, shall goe into the lowest parts of the earth; that is, either enter into their graves, or hide themselves in caves of the earth: they shall make him to run out like water; that is, cause Saul my capitall and mortall enemie to spill his
owne bloud, by falling upon his owne sword. And they shall be a portion for foxes. This clause of the prophecie was not fulfilled in Saul his person, nor his sonnes, for1 Sam. 31.12.13. their flesh was burnt and their bones buried under a tree at Jabesh: but in his servants and souldiers, which mortally wounded on the mounts of Gilboa, and being not able to helpe themselves, nor having any to burie them after they had breathed out their last gasp, fell to the foxes share: and therefore David purposely al∣tereth the number, saying not they shall cast him downe, and he shall bee a portion for foxes; but they shall be a portion for foxes, as in the truth of the story afterwards they fell to the foxes commons. Now after the death first of Saul, and the discomfiture of his royall armie, and the overthrow after∣wards of the Philistims, and destruction of all his enemies round about; King David, sitting safely and quietly in his throne, full of joy and comfort, breaketh forth into a Psalme of thanks-giving to God for his wonderfull victories and strange deliverances, and all the loyall subjects of Judah and Israel beare a part with him in it: whereat all those that before had falsely traduced his person, or impugned his right to his crowne, were put to si∣lence and shame. Thus have I set the tune in my text to the middle key also, and as you heare the musicke is sweet; if you will have the patience to heare it once more set to the lowest key, you will all perceive that every note in it confor∣teth not onely with our voices, but our thoughts and affections at this pre∣sent. I have shewed you how this prophecy in my text was fulfilled in Christ, Davids Lord, and secondly, in David the Lords Christ: may it please you out of your love to him, to whose honour you have dedicated this feast, to stretch out your patience to the length of the houre, and I shall briefly exemplifie the same in our Israels David. To resume then the words of this Scripture, and by the parts of it to draw the lineaments of that nar∣ration, which shall serve for my conclusion. First, I will relate unto you the attempt of the conspirators the Earle Gowrie and Alexander Ruthen his brother, and their complices, by the occasion of these words, They that seek my soule to destroy it. Secondly, the event, by occasion of the words follow∣ing, shall goe to the lowest parts of the earth, &c. They that seeke my soule to destroy it.

Nullam te toto orbe stil∣lam cruoris hu∣mani mifisse. untainted with the effusion of the least drop of bloud: for ambition is a sworne enemy to so∣veraignty, envie to eminencie, libertie to law, disorder to justice, faction to peace, schisme to unity, heresie to true religion: whereby it comes to passe that Princes, who are to right all men, are themselves most wronged of all men, by mis-information of their subjects demeanours towards them, and mis-construction of their actions, and proceedings, and affections also to∣wards their subjects. You will yet say, be it that the actions of Princes are subject to censure, and their persons, though sacred, yet sometimes lie open to violence: howsoever, if they establish their throne with judgement, and support their scepter with equity, their innocencie shalbe a perpetuall guard unto them, and the arme of the Almighty shall be a buckler of steele over them, and the love of subjects shall be a wall of brasse about them; so that the enemie shall not be able to hurt them, the sonnes of wickednesse shall not come neere them. Notwithstanding all this, it pleaseth him, by whom Kings reigne, either to make Princes to walk more humbly before him, and more warily before their subjects; or for the greater triall of their faith in grea∣test distresses, or cleerer manifestation of his power in their delivery, to ex∣pose their persons to imminent dangers, and suffer them to be led to the brinke of destruction, and to be entangled in the snares of death. How did he sufferCamerarius meditat. histor. c. 27.30. Charles the fifth to ascend to the top of the Pantheon in Rome, and there to looke out of a great gallery window, where there was a desperate villaine set to take him up by the heeles and throw him downe headlong? How did hee suffer that staine of the French Nobility to approach neare Augustus in the dangerous passage of the Alpes, with a purpose to justle him out of the narrow path into the steepe of the hill, where it was impos∣ble to stay himselfe? Was not Titus past all mans helpe, and given over for dead a thousand times, when scouting out with a few to spie the ene∣mies campe, at the siege of Jerusalem, he fell unawares into an ambush, and
was constrained to passe through a volly of darts and arrowes, cast and shot at him, whereof some fell before him, some behind him, many on each side of him: yet by Gods marvellous protection not one fastened on him? Was not Fredericke the first at the brinke of destruction by the river side, when a souldier tooke hold on him, and clasped about him to draw him with him∣selfe into the deep and drown him? Had notCambd. in vit. Reg. Eliz. Parry the meanes and op∣portunity to parley with Queene Elizabeth of famous memory in her garden privately, with a dagger in his hand, and a dag charged? These and many other presidents of the like nature make me the lesse marvaile that God should suffer Ruthwen, with a golden hooke, (a pot full ofVid l. Angl. scrip. de conjura. Gowr. outlandish coyne) to draw his Majestie through divers chambers, which hee still locked after them, into that dismall study which was more fearefull than any Jesuits chamber of meditation; in which they shut up their desperate instruments to cracke their braines, and fit them for horrid designes. For there are but pictures onely of Divels, and Images of severall kindes of death; but here were very Divels incarnate, and death it selfe. Bookes he saw none in this study, but those two mentioned bySutton in vita Calig. Suetonius, in which Caligula wrote the names of those men whose heads he meant to take off; calling the one of them, which was longer, gladium, the sword; the other, which was shorter, pugionem, the dagger. The subject he was now to medi∣tate upon was a bloudie assacinate, and the points he was to handle, no other than the sharpe ends of swords and rapiers. Made then he was to beleeve that he should there take an outlandish man, with great store of treasure; but he found an armed man, ready to take away that from him which was more precious unto him than all the jewels in the world. Here wee see what a soveraigne care the Highest hath over soveraigne Princes his vice∣gerents on earth, and what a terrour sacred Majestie striketh into the hearts of barbarous and bloudie traitors. The Italian varlet had not the power to lift at Charles the fifth: with a lift onely he had throwne him out of the window. The French miscreant had not the power to push at Augustus: with a push only he had broken his neck downe the steepe Alpes. Parry had not the power to draw the pin of his fire-lock: upon the moving but of a pinne the dag had gone off in his hand, and the Queene had beene shot through the heart. Parry's dag fell out of his hand, and Hendersons dag∣ger stucke in his hand; he could no more stirre it than the souldier at Min∣ternum, who drew upon Caius Marius, but was not able to strike a stroke, nor make a thrust at him. Lucan de bell. Phasal.—primo nam caedis in ictu Diriguit, ferrum{que} manu torpente remisit. Howbeit, though Hendersons faint heart and benummed hand would not serve him to act his bloudie part; yet the Divell so hardened Ruthwen, that he tooke out the other dagger, and set the point thereof at his Maje∣sties royall breast. And now if ever any lay interEras. adag. sacrum & saxum, be∣tweene the axe and the blocke, orTheori. in dios∣c. , upon the edge of the razor, or in ipsis fatiCic. Catilin. ai. 2. faucibus, in the very chops of destinie, or jawes of death it selfe; at the point lay the hope then, and now the joy and life of us all.
Alone, in a remote place, his servans and attendants barred from him by many doores locked and bolted, himselfe destitute of all weapons, betweene two Conspirators, with a poynard bent to his heart. O King live for ever, is not thy God whom thou servest able to deliver thee from this perill of death? Could hee not snatch thee out of the paw of the Lion? Could hee not have strucke downe both the Conspirators dead to the floore with a thunderbolt from heaven, or at the least taken away the use of Ruthwens limbes, drying up that hand that presumed to touch the apple of his owne eye, the sacred person of our Soveraigne? With a word he could, but it seemed best to his all-sweetly-disposing providence wonderfully to preserve his Majestie, yet without a miracle. For if he had rescued him by any such miraculous meanes as I named before, there had beene no occasion offered, nor place left for his Majesties faithfull servants to stake their lives for their Master: neither had the world taken such no∣tice of his Majesties rare gift of eloquence, by the force whereof, like an∣otherCic. de orat. l. 3. Antonie, intentos gladios jugulo retudit, he stayed the Traitors hand, and delayed the intended blow: first, clearing his owne innocencie from the aspersion of bloud in the execution of the Traitors father, by course of justice, in his Majesties minority; then recounting to him the many princely favours he had conferred upon his brother, himselfe, and all their kindred: but especially laying before his eyes the horrour of the guilt of embruing his hands in the bloud of the Lords annointed; which said he, if my children and subjects should not revenge, the stones out of the wall, and the beames of the timber, conscious of such a villanie, would execute ven∣geance upon thee for so unnaturall, barbarous, and bloudie an act. In fine he promised in the word of a King, pardon for all the violence he had hi∣therto offered him, if he would yet relent and desist from his murtherous in∣tent and attempt of spilling royall bloud. At which words Ruthwens heart, though of Adamant, began to relent and give in; in such sort, that hee gave his Majestie a time to breathe, and offer up prayers with strong cries to the God of his salvation, who heard him in that hee feared, as you shall heare anon. In the interim, Ruthwen consults with the Earle Gowrie his brother, and according to the LatineEras. adag. Aspis a vipera sumit venenum proverbe, the aspe suckes poyson from the viper, wherewith he swelleth, and brusling up himselfe, flies at his Majestie the second time to sting him to death, and wrapping about him, begins to bind his royall hands; who nothing appalled at the hide∣ous shape of death within a fingers breadth of his heart, answers like himselfe, that he was borne free, and would die free and unbound: forth∣with he unlooseth his hands, and with one of them clasping the Trai∣tors sword, with the other he grapples with him, and, after much strug∣gling, his Majestie draweth the Traitor to the window, by which it so plea∣sed God to dispose for his Majesties safety, that some of his Majesties ser∣vants passed at that very instant, and both heard and saw in part, in what distresse his Majestie was, and made all possible speed to rescue him: but before they could force a way through so many doores, the King by power from above got the Traitor under him, and drew him by maine force to the top of the staire-case; where soone after the Kings servants, forcibly breaking through all barres, bolts and lockes, met with him,
and throwing him downe staires sent him with many wounds to his owne place, verifying the letter of this prophecie in the confusion of our Davids enemies, qui quaerunt praecipitium animae meae, they which seeke the downe∣fall of my soule, they shall goe or rather tumble downe with a witnesse. And so I passe from the Traitors attempt to the event and happy catastrophe, on the Kings part, of this not fained Interlude. They shall goe downe. By this time as I intimated but now, the Kings ser∣vants partly made, and partly found their way into the study, rushing in to save the life of their Soveraigne; where they had no sooner dispatched one of the brothers Alexander Ruthwen, but the other brother the Earle, with seven of his servants well appointed, encountreth them. The skir∣mish growes hot betweene them; these fighting for their lives, they for their Soveraigne; these animated by hope, they whet on by desperation, After many wounds given and received on both sides, they of the Kings part, according to the words of the tenth verse, cast him down; or, as it is in the Hebrew, make his bloud spin or run out like water on the ground: his, I say, the arch-Traitor the Earle Gowrie, who may be compared to Saul Da∣vids chiefe enemie; whose downefall the spirit in the pronoune in the sin∣gular number him pointeth at, in many respects, but especially in this, that he tooke counsell of the Divell to murther the Lords Annointed. For as Saul conferred with the Witch at Endor before he put himselfe into the field which he watered with his bloud, so the Earle Gowrie, before hee entred into this Acheldamah field of bloud, pitched by himselfe, hee made the Divell of his counsell, and was found with many magicke cha∣racters about him when he fell by the edge of the sword. If any man question how it could so fall out that Alexander Ruthwen, being more nimble, strong, and expert in wrestling, and having many wayes advantage on his Majestie, should not throw him downe, or get him under him; I answer out of the words immediately going before my text, dextra Jehovae sustentabat eum, the right hand of the Lord supported him the King: by whose speciall providence it was ordered, that his Majesties servants should passe by the window at the very moment when his Majestie looked out; as also, that some of them should finde that blinde way by the turne-pecke into the studie which the Earle Gowrie caused to bee new made for this his divellish enterprise. Therefore his Majestie, as soone as the bloudie storme was blowne over, kneeled downe in the middest of all his servants, and offered up the calves of his lips to the God of his life; promising a perpetuall memorie of this his deliverie, and professing that hee assured himselfe that God had not preserved him so wonderfully for nought, but that he reserved him for some greater worke and service to his Church, as wee see this day. There remaineth yet one clause in my text; And the mouth of every one that speaketh lies shall bee stopped: and answerably an appendix to the narration of the conspiracie of the Gowries, for stopping the mouthes of all that shall call in question the truth of that relation. Which besides the conscience of his Majesty, the deposition of his servants, the publicke justice of the Parliament of Scotland, the solemne piety and devo∣tion of the Churches of great Brittaine and Ireland, was sixteene yeeres af∣ter the plotting thereof, and eight yeeres after the acting confirmed by the
publicke, free, and voluntarie confession ofVid. a booke intituled, the examination of G. Sprot, pub∣lished with a learned preface to it by G.A. Dr. D. and Dean of Winchester. George Sprot, arraigned and executed at Edinburgh for it. Thus have I fitted each member of this prophecy to the severall parts of the storie of his Majesties deliverance as on this day: betweene which there is such good correspondencie, that the prophesie seemeth text to the storie, and the storie a commentarie on the prophesie. Ob∣serve I beseech you the harmony of them, and let your heart dance with joy at every straine. 1. The first is, They that seeke my soule to destroy it, shall goe downe, &c. This was exemplified, and according to the letter accomplished in Alexander Ruthwen, who sought the ruine of our David, and was himselfe throwne downe the staires, and after part of him into the lowest parts of the earth, a deepe pit, into which his bowels were cast. 2. The second is, They shall cast him downe by the edge of the sword. This was accomplished in the Earle Gowrie, whom the Kings servants smote in the study with the edge of the sword, that hee died and fell at their feet. 3. The third is, And they shall be a portion for foxes; that is, lie unbu∣ried for a prey to the fowles of heaven, and beasts of the earth: this was accomplished in all the Traitors, who were according to the Lawes of the kingdome hanged, drawne and quartered, and their quarters set up upon the most eminent parts of the Citie, where the fowles preyed upon them till they dropped downe to the ground, and were made an end of by some ravenous beasts. 4. The fourth is, The King shall rejoyce in God. This was literally verified in our King, who joyfull after hee was plucked out of the jawes of death, gave publicke thankes to God, and ascribed the whole glo∣ry of his deliverance and victorie over his enemies to his gracious good∣nesse; and in memorie of this so great a benefit, commanded this feast, which wee now celebrate, to be solemnly kept in all his Dominions yeerely. 5. The fifth is, And all that sweare by him, that is, all which worship the true God, the God of our Jacob; or all that sweare to him, that is, alle∣giance to his Majestie, shall glorie. This, as it was accomplished in other congregations, so is it in us here present, assembled to glorie in the Lord for this wonderfull delivery of their then, and now also our Sove∣raigne. 6. The sixt and last is, And the mouth of all that speake lies shall bee stopped. This was also fulfilled by the meanes of George Sprot, who by his pious behaviour, and penitent confession at his death, and a signe which he promised to shew after his breath should be stopped, and according∣ly performed (after he had hanged a great while, clapping his hands a∣bove his head) stopped the mouth of all such as before spake lies against the truth of the precedent relation. To the lively expression whereof, I have borrowed, as you see, Davids princely characters, and set the presse, placing each letter in his ranke, and part in his order. What remaineth but that I pray to God by his spirit to stampe them in our hearts, and so im∣print
them in our memories, that he that runneth may reade our thank∣fulnesse to God for this deliverance, and confidence in his future prote∣ction of our Soveraignes person, and love and loyaltie to his Majestie, whom God hath so strangely saved from the sword, to save the sword from us; that in peace and safety he might receive and sway the Scepter of these Kingdomes of great Brittaine and Ireland. Which long may hee, with much prosperity and honour, to the glory of God, and propagation of the truth, libertie, and safetie of the Church and Common-wealth, ex∣ceeding joy and comfort of all his friends, and remarkeable shame and confusion of his implacable enemies. So bee it. Deo patri, &c.
THE LORD PROTECTOR OF PRINCES; OR DEUS ET REX, GOD AND THE KING. A Sermon appointed to be preached before his Grace at Croydon, August 5. 1620. THE SIXTH SERMON. PSAL. 21.1. The King shall joy in thy strength, O Lord: and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoyce? Or, (as wee reade in the Bishops Bible) The King shall rejoyce in thy strength, O Lord: exceeding glad shall he be of thy salvation. THat manifold, or (to make a new compound to translate a compound) in the OriginallEph. 3.10. . multivarious wisedome and goodnesse of God, which hath illustrated the firmament with varietie of starres, some more, some lesse glistering and glorious; enamell'd the meadowes with choyce of flowers, some more, some lesse beautifull and fragrant; in∣riched the sands of the Sea with pearle, some more, some lesse orient; and veines of the earth with metals, some more, some lesse pre∣tious: hath also decked and garnished the Calendar of the Church with va∣riety of Feasts, some more, some lesse holy and solemn. You may observe a kinde of Hierarchy among them; some have a preheminence over the rest,
which we call greater and higher Feasts. Among which this day challen∣geth his place, on which we refresh the memorie of his Majesties rescue out of the prophane and impious hands of the Earle Gowry and Alexander Ruthwen. A paire of unnaturall brethren; brethren in nature, and brethren in a most barbarous and unnaturall attempt against their Soveraigne the Lords annointed: brethren by bloud, and brethren also in bloud: who by the just judgement of God cleansed that study with their owne bloud, which they would have for ever stained by the effusion there of the Roy∣all bloud of the most innocent Prince that ever sate on that or this Throne: whom almighty God seemeth not so much to have preserved from those imminent dangers he then escaped, as reserved for these unvaluable bles∣sings we now enjoy by the prorogation of his life; enlarging of his Scep∣ter and propagation of his Issue. In his life the life of our hope is revived; in his Scepter the Scepter of Christ is extended; in his stocke the root of Jesse is propagated, and shall, I hope, flourish to the end of the world. For this cause the King shall rejoyce, &c. he shall rejoyce in thee, we in him; he in thy strength, we in his safetie; both in thy salvation. Here is God assi∣sting, and the King trusting: God saving, and the King rejoycing: God blessing, and the King praising: lastly, the King desiring, and God satisfi∣ing his desires to the full, as you may see through the whole Psalme. In this verse you may discerne three remarkeable conjugations or couples. 1. God is joyned with the King. 2. Strength with confidence. 3. Salvation with exceeding great joy. And thus they depend each of other. 1. The King of God. 2. Confidence of strength. 3. Joy of salvation. 1. God exalteth the King. 2. Strength begetteth confidence. 3. Salvation bringeth with it exceeding joy. 1. God is above the King. 2. Salvation is above strength. 3. Exceeding joy above confidence. If the King seeke God, in him he shall find strength, and in his strength salvation, and in his salvation exceeding great joy. Marke the word King; it standeth as a cliffe before a song, which directeth the singers how to tune the notes, and lift up or depresse their voyces. If the King stand here as a lower cliffe for David, then strength is aid, salvation victory, rejoycing thanks-giving: but if the word King be set as an higher cliffe for Christ, then strength here is omnipotencie, salvation redemption of mankinde, re∣joycing the exaltation of the humane nature to the highest degree of cele∣stiall glory and happinesse. This heavenly Manna of Evangelicall doctrine which the Fathers finde within the golden pot, that is, the inward sense of
the words; the Jewish Rabbins note to be carved in the outside of the let∣ter: to speake yet somewhat plainer, that minde and meaning which the Christian Expositors make of the words, by referring them to the truth whereof David was a type, they gather from the very characters, for  transposed, is , the Anagram as it were of the word which sig∣nifieth to rejoyce is Mesiach, that is, Christ, or the annointed. Now the title of King is attributed to Christ in Scriptures sometimes ab∣solutely, sometimes with additions; but such as make him more absolute, exalting his crowne as farre above all corruptible crownes as the heaven is above the earth. For his stile given by the sacred Heralds is King immor∣tall, King of Heaven, King of righteousnesse, Prince of peace, Lord of life, Lord of quicke and dead, Lord of all, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. This heavenly crowne in glorie, as much obscuring the lustre of earthly Diadems as the Sun doth the least blinking starre, belongeth to our head Christ Jesus by a threefold right: 1. Of birth. 2. Of donation. 3. Of conquest. His birth giveth it him; for he is the first born of the Father, and thereforeGal. 4.1. heire of all things, and Lord of all. By gift also he hath it.Psal. 2.8. Luke 1.32. The Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his Father David, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever. Aske of mee, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy posses∣sion. It is his also by conquest, for he hath overcome the world, John 16.33. he hath conquered hell and death, and hath the keyes of both, Rev. 1.18. If you demand where his throne is, I answer, above at the right hand of his Father, Psal. 110.1. below in the hearts of all the faithfull, whom he ruleth by the Scepter of his word. Thus much for the cliffe, I set now to the notes, which are either 1. In rule. 2. In space. 1 The note in space I take from the coherence of this Psalm with the for∣mer; the last words of the former Psalme are Salvum fac Regem, Lord save the King, or Save Lord, let the King heare when we call: the first of this, Exultabit Rex in salute, The King shall rejoyce in thy salvation. That which there the Church prayeth for the King, here the King praises God for. The Chuch prayeth God there, ver. 1. The name of the God of Jacob defend thee, send thee helpe, and strengthen thee out of Sion. And ver. 4. grant thee thy hearts desire, and fulfill all thy mind: and doth not the King in this Psalme trace the former footsteps, and follow the same notes in this Psalme of thanks-giving? The King shall rejoyce in thy strength, ver. 1. And, thou hast given him his hearts desire, ver. 2. What instance I in divers Psalmes? In the same Psalme, for the most part, in the beginning the Pro∣phet soweth in teares, and in the end reapeth in joy; in the beginning hee complaineth, in the ending he prayseth; in the beginning he cries for sor∣row,
in the end he sings for joy; in the beginning we have a storme of pas∣sion, in the end the sunshine of Gods favour. The countenance of the Pro∣phet, drawne to the life in this booke of Psalmes, resembleth the picture of Diana at Delphos, quae intrantibus tristis, exeuntibus hilaris videbatur, the face whereof seemed to frowne upon all at their comming in, but to smile upon them at their going out. Such a copie of Davids countenance wee have Psal. 6. lowring at the first verse, Lord rebuke mee not in thine anger, &c. but clearing up at ver. 8. Depart from me yee workers of iniquitie, for the Lord hath heard the voyce of my weeping. How dolefully doth the 22. Psalme begin? My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee? but how sweetly doth it conclude from ver. 22. to the end? I will declare thy Name to my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee, &c. O the wonderfull power and efficacy of prayer, which in a moment pier∣ceth the clouds, and bringeth backe a blessing before wee can imagine it is gone out of our lips! Like a piece of Ordnance highly mounted it battreth the walls of heaven before the report thereof be heard on earth. No na∣turall agent produceth any effect before it selfe be produced: nothing bringeth forth before it selfe is brought forth: yet prayer worketh often∣times before it is made, and bringeth forth some good effect before it selfe is perfectly conceived: for God understandeth the thoughts before the notions are framed; he heareth the heart dictating, before the tongue, like the pen of a ready writer, copieth out our requests. Now if the prayer of one righteous man prevaileth so much with the Omnipotent, how much more the united prayers of the whole Church? If one trumpet sound so loud in the eares of the Almighty, how much more a consort of all the silver trumpets of Sion sounded together? If one sigh is of force to drive our barke to the wished haven, how much more a gale of sighes breathed from a million of Gods afflicted servants? What judgement cannot so many hands lifted up beare off from us? what bles∣sing are they not able to pull down from heaven? Wherefore, as the whole Synagogue with one mouth prayed God for their King, so according to Saint Pauls precept, the whole Christian Church offered up their united devotions for the Roman Emperour. The matter and forme of their pray∣er is set downe byTertul. in apol. Manibus ex∣pansis, quia in∣nocuis, capite nudo, quia non erubescimus, precantes sem∣per sumus pro omnibus Impe∣ratoribus, vitam illis prolixam, imperium secu∣rum, domum tutam, exerci∣tus fortes, Sena∣tum fidelem, populum pro∣bum, orbem quietum. Tertullian; With hands spread abroad, because innocent; and bare head, because not blushing, we are alwayes praying for all Empe∣rours, that God would grant unto them a long life, a happie reigne, a safe house, victorious armies, a faithfull councell, a loyall people, and a peace∣able world. And if according to SaintCypr. de laps. Cyprians passionate admonition we would joyne publickly our prayers to their prayers, and our teares to their teares, and our sighes to their sighes, who groane under the heavie yoake of heathenish or antichristian tyranny; who knoweth whether God would not change the face of Christendome, and not onely wipe bloud from the bodie, but also all teares from the eyes of his most disconsolate Spouse? Thus much of the notes in space; the notes in rule are specially In thy strength.1. That the onely securitie of Princes and States is in the strength of the Almighty. The King shall rejoyce in thy salvation.2. That God holdeth a speciall hand over Soveraigne Princes.
3. That Princes mightily defended and safely preserved by the arme of God must thankfully acknowledge this singular favour, and deliver their deliverances to after ages, that the children yet unborne may praise the Lord as we doe this day. 1. That Princes and states have no safe repose but under the shadow of the Almighty, I need not alledge any one Psalme for proofe: it is the burthen al∣most of every song. Not a string in Davids harp but soundeth out this tune, briefly,Psal. 2.12. happy are they that put their trust in him.Psal. 4.8. Thou Lord onely makest me to dwell in safety.Psal. 20.7. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but wee will remember the Name of the Lord our God.Psal. 21.7. The King trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.Psal. 44.6.8. I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me. In God wee boast all the day long: and praise thy Name for ever. Selah. Upon this note how excel∣lent doth he divide?Psal. 18.2. The Lord is my rocke, and my fortresse, and my deli∣verer: my God, my strength in whom I will trust, my buckler, the horne of my salvation, and my high tower.Xen. Cyr. p. ed. , &c. It is not the golden Scepter wee see Princes leane upon that supporteth them, it is the loyalty of their loving subjects which beareth them up: withdraw this golden Scepter from them they cannot stand.Plin. in panegyr. Satellitium principis ipsius innocentia op∣timum muni∣mentum muni∣mento non e∣gere. The best guard of a Prince, saith Plinie, is his owne innocencie, the best defence and munition to need none, for armes are provoked by armes; nei∣ther can a Prince be guarded from his owne guard but by his buckler of faith, and the right hand of the Almighty: Dextra mihi deus est, My right hand is my god saith he in the Poet falsely and blasphemously: but David truely and most religiously, The Lord is the strength of my right hand.Psal. 127.1. Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vaine that build it: except the Lord keepe the City, the watchman waketh but in vaine. Except the Lord protect the royall person of a Prince, the States-man counselleth, the Cap∣taine fighteth, the Guard waiteth but in vaine: no magazine of treasure, no arsenall of armour, no fleet by Sea, no forces by land, no alliance with neighbour Princes, no allegeance of subjects can secure their persons for a moment. Those in the bath who forsake their guides and will venter to goe of themselves are often drowned: and travellers who refuse or distrust their convoy when they passe through theevish places, dismissing them or stealing away from them, for the most part by escaping seeming danger, fall into certaine danger: so it fareth with them who rely not upon the protection of the Almighty, but seeke other helpe, aid and support, from the arme of flesh, or the braine of worldly Politicians.Jer. 17.5. Cursed is hee who maketh flesh his arme, and trusteth not in the Lord his God. To the truth of which verdict the greatest Potentates in the world have subscribed with their owne bloud. Nebuchadnezzar trusted in his Citie Babel, and it be∣came his Babel, that is, his confusion. Xerxes trusted in his multitude of men, his multitude encumbred him. Darius in his wealth, his wealth sold him. Eumenes in the valour of his regiment called the Silver-shields, his Silver-shields bound him and delivered him to Antigonus. Roboam in his young Counsellers, his young Counsellers lost him the ten Tribes. Caesar in his old Senatours, the Senatours conspired against him. Domitian in his guard, his guard betrayed him. Adrian in his Physicians, his Physicians
cast him away: Multitudo medicorum perdidit Adrianum Imperat orem. These all leaned upon Egyptian reeds, which not onely brake under them, and so deceived their trust; but also ran in to their hands and sides, and wounded them. By whom let us all learne to distrust all meanes of trust and confidence, save in the continuance of Gods favour, and the support of his power and Grace. St.Prosp. sent. ex∣cerpt ex Aug. Qui in se stat non stat, qui se sibi sufficere confidit, ab eo qui verè sufficit defici. Prosper out of St. Austine happily concludeth this point; Whosoever standeth upon himselfe standeth not; hee who is confi∣dent in his owne support, by this his arrogancie loseth the support of true confi∣dence; opinion of selfe-sufficiencie inferreth a deficiencie from him in2 Cor. 3.5. Not that we are sufficient of our selves to thinke a∣ny thing of our selves but our sufficiencie is of God. whom is all our sufficiencie. I have shewed you the pictures of those who have suffered shipwracke by making worldly policie their Pilot, and committing their bodie and goods to those brittle barkes which I before mentioned: behold now the cheerefull faces of those who in a deluge of troubles have yet arrived to the faire havens, being steered by the compasse of Gods Word, and carried safe in the arke of divine protection. How many mutinies against Moses? how many stratagems against Joshuah? how many attempts against Da∣vid? what preparations against Hezekiah? what combinations against Jehosaphat? what armies against Constantine? what fulminations from Rome, what Armadoes from Spaine, what poysons, what dags and daggers from Traitours at home against Queene Elizabeth? Yet all these were compassed as it were with a wall of brasse, and castle of Diamond, the Divine protection. Abijah and his people joyning battaile with Jero∣boam smote him and all Israel, and slew five hundred thousand, and tooke Bethel with the Townes thereof, and Jeshanah with the Townes thereof, and Ephraim with the Townes thereof; and the children of Israel, though farre more in number, were at that time brought under, and the children of Judah prevailed. Why? Because they were better soul∣diers? or better armed? or led by a more expert Generall? or because they had advantage of the place? Nay, rather they were every way disadvanta∣ged. For2 Chron. 13.13. Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah and the ambushment was behind them. To put you out of doubt, the holy Ghost yeeldeth a reason of Judahs prevailing,2 Chron. 13.18. be∣cause they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers. St. Austin parallels this wonderfull victorie with the like that fell out about his time. WhenAug. de Ci. Dei l. 5. c. 23. U∣no die Rhadage∣sus tanta celeri∣tate victus est, ut ne uno qui∣dem non dicam extincto, sed ne vulnerato qui∣dem Romano, multo amplius quam centum millium pro∣sternetur ex∣ercitus. Rha∣dagesus King of the Gothes with a puissant army environed Rome, and by reason of the small preparations in the City no hope could be expected from man, how did God performe the trust by his Saints reposed in him, and fought for them in this their greatest extremitie, and so discomfited the enemies, that in one day an army of a hundred thousand was utterly defea∣ted, not a man of the Roman side being slaine, nor so much as wounded? God loveth those best who trust him most, and he saveth them above meanes who hope in him above hope: as did Abraham the father of the faithfull. Beleeve him who spake it out of his owne experience:Psal. 125.1. They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.Ps. 91.1.4.5.6.7.10. ver. 4. He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
Thou shalt not be affraid for the terrour by night:5.6. nor for the arrow that fly∣eth by day: nor for the pestilence that walketh in darknesse: nor for the de∣struction that wasteth at noone-day. A thousand shall fall by thy side,7.10. and ten thousand at thy right hand, but it shall not come nigh thee. There shall no e∣vill befall thee, nor any plague come nigh thy dwelling.Psal. 3.8. Salvation belon∣geth to the Lord.Ps. 144.10. It is hee that giveth salvation unto Kings who deli∣vereth David his servant from the hurtfull sword. Why is the accent up∣on Kings? as likewise in the words of my text, The King shall rejoyce in thy strength, exceeding glad shall Hee bee of thy salvation. Doth not the wing of Gods provident care extend to all his Children? are they not all safe under his feathers? They are all; yet Kings are nearest to his breast, they receive more warmth from him, hee hath a speciall care of them, according to my second observa∣tion: That God taketh Princes into his peculiar protection. He keepeth them as the Signet of his finger, because in them the Image of his Soveraigne Majestie most brightly shineth. It concerneth him in honour to maine∣taine them who are his Vicegerents upon earth. It concerneth him in love to defend the defenders of the faith, and cherish the nursing Fa∣thers of his deerest Spouse. It concerneth him in wisedome to save them who are the breath of so many thousand nostrils; to keepe them whole who are theSen. de clem l. 1. c 4.

In the danger of a King is the hazzard of a State, in the hazzard of a State the ruine of a Church, in the ruine of a ChurchVid. Camerar. meditat. hist. c. 30. Magnos vios divinitus ab in∣sidiis saepenu∣merò conser∣vari. Gods honour lyeth in the dust. The heathen Poet glanced at this truth, when every where he sti∣leth Kings , as it were bred up and fostered in the bosome of Jove, or rather Jehovah. Keepe me, saith David, as the apple of thine eye: Who can endure the least pricke in the apple of the eye? no more will God abide his annointed to bee so much as1 Chro. 16.22. touched: Nolite tangere unctos meos. Is God so tender over Princes safety, and ought not they to bee as tender of his honour? Is hee so gracious to them, and ought not they bee as gratefull to him? The planets that receive more light from the Sunne, reflect more backe againe: the earth that receiveth raine from hea∣ven, returneth it backe in vapour: Cessat decursus donorum si cesset recur∣sus gratiarum:  God will shut the windowes of heaven, and restraine the golden showers of his blessings, if we send not up the sweet vapours and exhalations of our thankes-giving and praise. Hee forfeiteth his tenure who refuseth to doe his homage, bee it but the tendering of a red rose in acknowledgement of service. Such a kinde of homage Almighty God requireth of us for all we hold of him, the red roses of our lips, and the sweet savour of our devout meditations. Verily hee deserveth to lose his garden who will not afford his Landlord a flower. Si ingra∣tumSen. de bene fic. dixeris, omnia dixeris; if you call a man unthankefull you need say no more, for you cannot say worse: whosoever deserveth to be bran∣ded with a marke of Ingratitude, hath his conscience feared with a hot Iron. For what isCic. pro planc. Religion, but Gratitude to God; Pietie, but Gratitude to Parents; Loyaltie, but Gratitude to Princes; Charitie
and friendship, but gratitude to our neighbour. Now of all men Princes are most obliged to be thankfull to God, because the beames of his fa∣vour shine most bright in their Crownes and Scepters, he sets them in his owne seat of authoritie, investeth them with his owne robes of maje∣stie, armeth them with his owne sword of justice, supporteth them with his own Scepter of power, adorneth them with his owne Diademe of roy∣all dignitie, and graceth them with his own stile of Deity, Ego dixi dii estis, I have said yee are Gods,Joh. 10.34. & Psal. 82.6. and all of you are children of the most High. Above all therefore Princes ought to be most gratefull to God, because God hath placed them in that high condition, that all other owe dutie and thankfull service to them, and they to him alone. Thankes are not thankes-worthy if they flote onely in the mouth for a time, and spring not continually from the heart. That gratitude is gratefull and acceptable to God and men, whose root is in the heart, and blossomes in the tongue, and fruits in the hands; whose root is love, and blossomes praises, and fruits good works. The root in the heart cannot be seene of any but God, the blossomes in the lips are blowne away with a breath, but the fruits in the hands are more lasting. Wherefore Noah was not contented after he and his fami∣ly were saved from the deluge to offer up a sweet smelling sacrifice of thankes-giving upon the Altar of his heart; but he leaveth behind him an Altar of stone, Jacob an house to God, Joshua a Trophey, Solomon a Tem∣ple, the Centurion a Synagogue, Veronica a statue of brasse, Constantine many Churches and Hospitals, Paula a magnificent Monasterie at Bethle∣hem, where our Lord was borne. The Heathen after they had escaped shipwracke hung up theirHorat. od. Me tabula sacer vo∣tiva paries indi∣cabit humida suspendisse ve∣stimenta Maris deo. votivas tabulas to Neptune. After victorie, be∣sides supplications per omnia pulvinaria deorum, they put garlands upon the Images of their gods, and left the chiefe spoyles taken in warre in the Temple of Mars. The Jewes by the commandement of God reserved a golden pot of Manna in the Arke, in memorie of that Manna which fell in the Wildernesse. In a thankfull acknowledgement of the deliverance of their first borne in Egypt, they offered every first borne to God: and to eternize the memoriall of their passage out of Egypt, and freedome from servitude, they altered their Calendar, and made that moneth in which God by Moses delivered them out of the house of bondage theExod. 12.2. beginning of their moneths. Application.According to which religious presidents our gracious King, being as upon this day pulled out of the paw first of the Beare, and then of the Lion and his seven clawes, hath erected a lasting, living, and which is more, a speaking monument of his thankfulnesse to God, by appointing the feast we now keepe to preserve from oblivion his Majesties wonderfull preser∣vation on this day from imminent destruction. When a motion was made in the Senate of dedicating a statue of massie gold to the honour ofTacit. annal. l. 2. Illae verae sunt Statuae quae in hominum men∣tibus collocan∣tur. Germa∣nicus, Tiberius the Emperor opposed it, but upon a very plausible pretence, that Images of brasse and gold are subject to many casualties; they may be stolne away, they may be defaced and battered, foule indignities and scorns be put upon them. Those are the true Statues of vertue and Altars of fame which are set up in mens mindes: such Altars hath our Soveraigne ere∣cted in the hearts of all his loving subjects, upon which wee offer this
day throughout all his dominions the sacrifice of praise and thankes-giving for his Majesties marvellous deliverance, unparalleld in our age.Psal. 19.2. Dies ad diem eructat sei mo∣nem, & nox ad noctem annun∣ciat scientiam. One day shall tell another, and one night shall proclaime it to another what great things the Lord did upon this day for his Annointed, whereat we rejoyce. How was his Majestie wrapt over and over in the snares of death, when under colour of taking a Seminarie Priest (as he was made beleeve) newly arri∣ved with a pot full of golden seeds to sow rebellion and treason in his King∣dome, he was led by Alexander Ruthwen through so many chambers into that study which was a long time before appointed for the stage whereon to act that bloudie tragedie, whose catastrophe was as happy to the King and Kingdome, as dismall and fatall to the principall Actors. If ever study might be rightly termed according to the Latine name armarium, this was it; for it was not musaeum, but campus Martius, not a students treasurie, but a traitors armorie: here he findeth but two Authors, and they should both have beene Actors. In stead of the gold which was promised, here he seeth Iron and steele, and no strange coyne as he was borne in hand, but his own, I meane the crosse daggers, not stamped on metall, but readie to be driven into his sacred breast, and sheathed in his bowels. Well might the King here cry uponPhilo de legat. Alex. Ubi cessat humanum auxi∣lium ibi adest divinum. Philo as Croesus did uponHerod. clio. Solon when hee stood on the pile to be burned, and the fire was kindled at the bottome: O Philo, Philo, I finde thy words to be gospell, though thou wert an unbeleeving Jew. Mans ex∣treamest necessitie is Gods chiefest opportunitie: then commeth helpe from heaven when the earth is at a stand, and man at his wits end. What hope was here from man? whence could the King expect any helpe being unarmed, unattended, unguarded, betweene two Traitors (as Christ be∣tweene two theeves) with the point of a dagger at his heart, in that darke roome? Whence or how should there breake in any light of comfort from any the least chinke? Where should his hope cast anchor? Upon his servants and traine? But besides many doores, lockes, bolts and barres betweene them and his Majestie, most of them by the Earle Gowry upon a false alarum were sent out of doores to post after him in the field. Upon the Traitor himselfe? But his respectlesse and barbarous carriage, his desperate speeches, his execrable oathes, his bloudie lookes, his sparkling eyes, and glistering poynard drawne threatned nothing put present death. Upon himselfe? But alas he had no weapon defensive or offensive, and now the signe was at the heart, I meane the daggers point at his breast. O the dread of sacred Majestie! O the bulwarke of innocencie! O the power of eloquence! O the force of conscience! which though they could not blunt the point of the Traito dagger, yet they dulled the edge of his malice for a time. When a scholar of St.Ruffin. in hist. John the Evangelist, mis-led by ill company, had turned to a Ruffian, and common hackster, and robber by the high way, and drew at his master; upon a word only, spoken to him by St. John, he re∣lents, flings away his weapon, falls downe upon his knees, craveth pardon with teares, and promiseth for ever to abandon his wicked course of life. So powerfull is the ministerie of the word and mighty in operation, so reverend is the calling of the dispencers of Gods mysteries, that the naming only of a dead Preacher Mr. Rollock preserved for a time the life of our So∣veraigne. Ruthwen cannot endure to heare that the soule of Master Rollock
should accuse him before Christs tribunall, for defiling the doctrine of the Gospel which he taught him, by the bloud spilt by him of the Lords An∣nointed. His heart gives in, and he withdraweth himselfe for a while, and thereby giveth his Majestie time to breathe, and meanes to cause the study window to be opened, at which entred some light of comfort.Cic. pro Sylla. Sed urget ea∣dem fortuna quae caepit; his Majestie must yet beare a worse brunt. For like as a Toad, being eased of his swelling for a time by eating of a planten leafe, if he meet with a Spider afterwards receiveth new poyson, and swel∣leth more than before: even so Alexander meeting with the Earle Gowry his brother, (who was the Spider that spun all the web of this treason, which within a few houres was swept downe and himselfe in it with the besome of destruction) receiveth new poyson from him, and now is so bigge with ma∣lice and treason that he is ready to breake. In therefore he comes againe to the study with two rapiers, and first binding himselfe by oath to bereave his Majestie of his life, he offereth to binde his royall hands. But the King put∣ting on the resolution of the Oratour,Cic. in Catil. Si moriendum est in libertate mo∣riamur. If we must die let us die as free men, looseneth his hands, and fastning upon the Traitors hand and sword grap∣pleth with him, and by maine force drew him to the window (a little be∣fore opened) whence by speech and signes he made knowne to his faith∣full servants, at that instant passing under the window, how things stood with him, and how neer he was to utter ruine by trecherous villany. As soon as they heard his Majesties voyce they made all possible speed to rescue their master; yet before they could force the way through so many doores, lockes and barres betweene them and their immured Soveraigne, the light of all Israel had in all likelihood beene extinguished, but that one of the Kings servants by the secret conduct of divine providence ligh∣ted upon the false doore opening to the staire case, which hee had no soo∣ner got up, but he seeth the King on the ground, and the Traitor grap∣pling with him, whom after hee had loosened from the King, with many wounds he tumbled downe the staires to receive his fatall blow from two other of his Majesties servants, who by this time had found the blind way leading to the turnepecke. And thus was the first act of this bloudie tragedy ended by the exit or going out of the first Actor Alexander Ruthwen, first out of that stage, and soone after of this world. The next act though more bloudie yet was by so much the lesse dreadfull, because the King by his servants, velutEras. adag. homerica nube tectus, was saved out of murthers way. Now his Majesties honourable attendance must prove their valour, and testifie their loyaltie by as many mouthes as they received wounds in that hot skirmish, wherein their Antagonists had the advantage of all things save the cause: double they were in number, better appointed of weapons, and more acquainted with the place. For the Earle Gowry (like the man possessed in the Gospel, whichLuke 11.26. walked through drie places, and took to him seven spirits worse than himselfe) armed himself, and took seven of his servants with him, more hardy and desperate than himself, and finding his brother newly slain, , was so enraged with furie and revenge, that he swea∣reth at his entrie into the chamber that not a man of them should scape, cal∣ling them by hisCic. parad. Ex∣lem me suo nomine vocat. owne name Traitors. Here malice and love, fury and courage, trechery and loyalty, villanie and pietie trie it out at the point of
the sword, and the combat is soon ended by the death of the Arch-Traitor. Upon whose fall the hearts of the rest faile, and they are now easily driven out of the room, and fresh aid commeth to the King by the rest of his train, who by this time had broken down all the doores, and made a passage into the study, where now they finde the King safe, and the Earle Gowry lying dead at his feet. Whereupon they all fell upon their knees, and praised the mighty God of Jacob, who giveth salvation to Kings, and then had delive∣red his servant James from the perill of the sword: then were the words of my text verified, The King shall rejoyce in thy strength, O Lord, exceeding glad shall he be of thy salvation. Then, if ever, our King joyed in thy strength, and in thy salvation excessively rejoyced. And not long after the words fol∣lowing (ver. 3.) were fulfilled in him; Thou preventedst him with blessings of goodnesse, and thou didst set a Crowne of pure gold upon his head, viz. the Crowne of England; which shortly after fell unto him, and hath ever since flourished upon his head: and so Lord may it still till he changeth this his corruptible crowne with an incorruptible, and his mortall state with an immortall, purchased for him and all of us by the death and passion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit be rendred all glorie, honour, praise and thanks-giving now and for ever. Amen.
PANDORA'S BOXE; OR, THE CAUSE OF ALL EVILS AND MISERY. A Sermon preached before the high Commis∣sion in his Graces Chappell at Lambeth. THE SEVENTH SERMON. HOS. 13.9. Hesiod. erg. l. 1. .O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy selfe, but in me is thy helpe. Most Reverend, Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. I Should tremble to rehearse this text in your eares, if there were not comfort in it as well as terrour, joy as sorrow, helpe as calamity, salvation as destruction. But you may easily discerne in it a double glasse set be∣fore us; in the one we may see our hurt, in the other our helpe; in the one Israel fallen, in the other raised up; in the one Adam and all his posteritie wounded by a grievous fall from the Tree of knowledge, and weltring in their owne blood, in the other healed and washed by Christs bloud; in the one de∣struction from within, (Thou hast destroyed thy selfe O Israel) in the other salvation from above; (but in me is thy helpe.) In the Originall  it hath destroyed thee, or one hath destroyed thee, or thy destruction O Israel, or O Israel thy utter ruine and desolation. An abrupt and imperfect sen∣tence, to be made up with something that goeth before, or to be gathered from that which followeth after,  but or for in me is thy helpe. There were never pictures held in greater admiration than those ofPlin. l. 35. c. 10. Ti∣manthes, and they for this especially, that they exhibited more to the un∣derstanding than to the eye, intimating more than was expressed, and pre∣senting alwayes somewhat to the conceit which could not by co∣lours be represented to the sight. And for the like reason, those straines of
Rhetorike most take the wise, and affect the judicious eare, which expresse more by expressing lesse, the sentence being broken off in the midst, to shew the force of violent passion which bereaveth us on the sudden both of sense and speech. The Musicians also in their way tickle the eare by a like grace in musicke to that figure in speech by unexpected stops and rests, making a kinde of Aposiopesis and harmonicall Ellipsis. Surely as the bro∣ken joynts and maimed limbes of men uncovered much move us to com∣passion; so the imperfect and maimed members of sentences, uttered in an∣ger or griefe, are aptest both to signifie and to move passion. Such is that broken speech of2 King. 13.14. Joash the King concerning Elisha, over whose face hee wept and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof. And that ofPsal. 6.3. David, My soule is sore troubled, but thou O Lord how long! And the like of ourLuke 19.42. Saviour, If thou hast knowne, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace. And semblable there∣unto is this in my text, Shikethka, Jisrael perdidit te, or perditio tua, it hath undone thee, or thy ruine O Israel. For those words (ex te) which we finde in many latine copies are added by the Translator to fill up the breach in the sentence: in the Hebrew there is a verball Ellipsis or defect, which ex∣presseth a reall Ellipsis or utter failing of Israels strength, and a figurative Ellipsis and seeming deficiency in God himselfe, through a deepe taking to heart of Israels now most deplorate estate: Virg Aen. 2.—ruit Ilium & ingens Gloria Dardanidum. The Crowne of Israel is fallen from his head, and all his honour lyeth in the dust. Israel after many grievous strokes and wounds received, now bleeds at the heart, and is a breathing out his last gaspe; and the God of Israel by a Sympathy of griefe seemeth to lie speechlesse. For his words faulter: thy destruction Israel, or it hath destroyed thee, Israel is destroy∣ed, who hath destroyed Israel? or why is Israel destroyed? why is the cause and author of Israels woe concealed, and the sentence left abrupt and imperfect?Tertul. adver. Hermog. c. 22. Adoro Scriptu∣rae plenitudi∣nem. Tertullian speaking of the perfection of Scripture saith, I a∣dore the fulnesse of the Scriptures: in another sense, yet true, I may use the contrary attribute, and say, I adore the deficiencies and seeming vacuities in Scripture sentences, where the roome left for words is anticipated by passion, and filled up with sighs and grones. Will you have the cause why God expresseth not the cause of Israels plagues? Because he would not adde unto them. Had he filled up the bracke in the contexture of the sen∣tence, it must have bin with these or the like words, by the consent of In∣terpreters, It is thy stubborne heart, O Israel, and thy open rebellion against mee: it is thy stoning my Prophets, and killing my messengers sent early and late unto thee: it is thy spirituall fornication, and Idolatrous worship of Je∣roboams golden calfes that hath heretofore brought all thy miserie upon thee, and now hath wrought thy finall overthrow. But alas this had beene to mingle judgement with wormewood, to kill them with a word whom he meant to smite with a sword. It is enough for a Judge to pronounce the dreadfull sentence of death, it is too much then to fall foule upon the prisoner with
amplifications and bitter invectives. Howbeit, whether for these or better reasons best knowne to himselfe, God doth not here particularly set down the author or cause of Israels woe; yet in the other member of the sentence (but in mee is thy helpe) removing the cause from himselfe, and professing that there had beene helpe in him for them, but for some barre: he giveth them to understand in generall what it was hee forbare to speake, but they could not but conceive, and wee must gather out this Scripture for our in∣struction, that the cause of Israels overthrow, and the ruine of all other Kingdomes is in their sinnes, and from themselves. As in musicke, though each string hath a different sound by it selfe, yet many of them strucke to∣gether make but one chord: so the last translation which I follow, and all the former which I have read, though they much differ in words, yet they accord in the sense by mee now delivered. For whether wee reade as some doe, Rex tuus, thy King; or as others, Vitulus tuus, thy calfe; or as Calvin, Aliquid praeter me, something besides me hath destroyed thee; or as St. Jerome doth, Perditio tua ex te, thy destruction is from thy selfe; or as the Kings Translators render the Hebrew, thou hast destroyed thy selfe, the sentence is all one, thy mischiefe is from thy selfe, but all thy hope of help is from thy God. Julian gave for his armes in his Scutchion an Eagle strucke through the heart with a flight shaft feathered out of her owne wing, with this Motto, propriis configimur alis, our death flies to us with our owne feathers, and our wings pierce us to the heart. To apply this patterne to my text, and leave the print thereof upon it to imprint the doctrine thereof deeper in your memories. The Eagle strucke dead is the Church and Com∣mon-wealth of Israel, the arrow is the swift judgement of God, the feathers shed out of her owne wings which carried the arrow so swift, and drave the head of it in so deepe are Israels sinnes. It is a lamentable thing to heare of the ruine and utter overthrow of any Kingdome; how much more of the downefall of Israel Gods chosen people, his chiefe treasure, his on∣ly joy? But that Israel should be Israels overthrow, that Israel should be felo de se, and accessarie to his owne death and utter confusion; this must needs pricke the quickest veine in our hearts. And these are the three points which by the assistance of Gods spirit I am first to cleare to your under∣standing, and after to presse upon your religious affections: 1. The accident to the subject: Destruction. 2. The subject of this accident: Israel. 3. The cause of this accident in this subject: Thou, or thy sinnes; thou by thy sinnes hast destroyed thy selfe O Israel. First, of the privative accident, destruction. Destruction is opposed to construction, as corruption to generation: and as that is the death and disso∣lution of all naturall bodies, so this of all artificiall. I except not such as are purposely made to preserve corpses from corruption and putrefaction, as coffins of lead, and sepulchres of Marble. For these also in time cor∣rupt and moulter away: —Sunt ipsis quo que fata sepulchris.
Nay, we may make this strong line of the Poet a little stronger,ver. 14. and say truly, sunt ipsis quo que fatis fata; death it selfe hath his dying day: for my Prophet in this chapter threatnethO death I will be thy plagues O grave I will be thy destruction. death with death, and the grave with destruction. Howbeit destruction here, as it is applied to Israel, seemeth not so much to signifie destruction in the vulgar acception, that is, the pul∣ling downe of the houses, or sacking of townes and villages, as the dissolution of the state, and downefall of the Kingdome of Israel: and therefore the point herein to be seriously thought upon is the Soph Pasuck full point, and fatall period of all earthly States, Societies, Common-wealths and King∣domes. All naturall things carry in their stile Corruptible, all humane in their stile mortall, all earthly in their stile Temporall: to distinguish the first sort from things supernaturall, which are incorruptible; the second sort from things divine, which are immortall; the third sort from heaven∣ly, which are eternall. The things which are seene, saith the2. Cor. 4.18. Apostle, are temporall, but the things which are not seene, are eternall. It is the royall prerogative of him whoApoc. 19.16. & 17.14. hath written upon his thigh, and on his vesture, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, that his Kingdome is bounded with no limits, nor confined to time: the eternity whereof is proclaimed in holy Scrip¦tures by five noble Heralds, two Kings, two Prophets, and an Arch∣angell. The two Kings arePsal. 45 6. Thy throne O God is for ever. David andDan. 4.32. Whose dominion is an everlasting do∣minion. Nebuchadnezzar. The two Prophets areCap. 17.14 His kingdome is that which shall not be destroyed. Daniel andMicah 4.7. The Lord shall reigne from hence∣forth even for ever. Micah. The Archangell isLuke 1.31, 32, 33. Horat. car. l. 1. od 3. Semotique prius tarda ne∣cessitas leti cor∣ripuit gradum. Gabriel, whose trumpet soundeth most shrill, and giveth a most certaine sound: Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy wombe, and bring forth a sonne, and shalt call his name Jesus, ver. 31. He shall be great, and shall be called the sonne of the Highest, and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David, ver. 32. And he shall reigne over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his King∣dome there shalbe no end, ver. 33. Of all other there shalbe. For all politike bodies are in some sort subject to the condition of natural bodies. As these, so they have their beginning or birth, growth, perfection, state, decay and dissolution. And as the statures of men in this decrepit and feeble age of the world are much diminished, and their life shortened; so even States and Empires fall short of their former greatnesse, and are like sooner to arrive to their period, naturall end, or to speake more properly, civill death and dissolution, called in my text destruction. Some who have taken upon them to calculate as it were the nativitie of the world, and erect a scheme of all the living, have set the utmost day of the duration of the one, and life of all the other to fall within foure hundred yeares, according to an ancient tra∣dition of the Jewes fathered upon the house ofMelancthon in Chron. l. 1. p. 10. Sex millia an∣norum mundus; duo millia ina∣ne, duo millia lex, duo millia dies Messiae: & propter pec∣cata nostra quae multa & magna sunt deerunt anni qui dec∣runt. Elias: The world shall last sixe thousand yeeres; two thousand thereof there shall be a vacuitie or empti∣nesse; two thousand the Law shall continue; and the dayes of the Messiah shall make out two thousand more; of which if any be lacking, by reason of our many and grievous sinnes they shall be lacking. The Cabalists favour this conceit, and labour to wierdraw it out of the first verse of the first chapter of Genesis, where because they finde sixe Alephs or A's which in numerall characters signifie so many thousand yeares, conclude the duration of the world from the first creation to the end shall make up just that number of yeeres. And many also of our Christian Chronologists, streining the let∣ter of2 Pet. 3.8. One day with the Lord is as a thou∣sand yeeres, and a thousand yeeres as one day. St. Peter too farre, allot precisely sixe thousand yeares for the conti∣nuance
of the world; at the seventh thousand they beleeve we shall all be∣gin to keepe our everlasting Sabbath in heaven. For the period of particu∣lar Kingdomes GasperPucer. praesat. in Chron. Carion. Hanc periodum lege quadam sancitam divi∣nits magnis Impeiis fata∣lem esse, & uni∣versales mutati∣ones afferre ostendunt om∣nium tempo∣rum historiae. Peucerus observeth that it seldome or never ex∣ceedeth 500. years; which he proveth by these instances following. From the departure of the children of Israel out of Egypt to the building of the first Temple we finde much about five hundred yeeres run out: the first, as also the second Temple stood thereabouts: the Assyrians ruled in Asia so long: Athens was ruled by Kings, Rome by Consuls just so many yeers: From Augustus to Valentinian the last, five hundred yeeres are reckoned, all which time the seat of the fourth Monarchy of the world was fixed at Rome. The Church of Rome in a sort continued in her puritie for five hun∣dred yeeres: After the Papacie and superstition grew to the height in the westerne parts before the thousanth yeere, and five hundred yeeres after the happy reformation begun by Martin Luther. Yet neither that traditi∣on of the house of Elias, nor the observation of Peucerus are of infallible certaintie.Acts 1.7. which the Father hath  in his owne power. It belongeth not to us to know times and seasons: and though often God hath translated Kingdomes within the limits of five hundred yeeres, yet not alwayes: some have lasted longer, as the Monarchy of the Assyrians; some farre shorter, as the monarchy of the Persians; and after them of the Grecians. The Christian Kings of Jerusalem finished their course within a hundred yeeres. Men may probably ghesse at the circum∣volution of great Empires and Kingdomes: but neither can the Astrolo∣gers certainely foresee by the course of the starres, norBod. de rep. l. 4. c. 2. ex Plat. pol. 8. Platonicks define by the accomplishment of the nuptiall number, nor Politicians foretell by their intelligence with forreine States, nor Magicians determine by conference with their familiar spirits: but the Prophets of God onely forewarne by inspiration from him who hath decreed before all time the dayes of man, and continuance of families, and periods of Kingdomes, and ages of the world, and lasting of time it selfe. That which Belshazzar saw,Dan. 5.25.26. a hand writing upon the wall, all Princes and States may see and read in the records of heaven kept in holy Scripture: Mene, Mene, thou art num∣bred, thou art numbred, thy yeares are summed, thy dayes are appoin∣ted, thine houre is set. Be thou as great and glorious as Nebuchadnezzars Image with a head of gold, armes of silver, bellie and thighes of brasse, and legs of Iron; yet thou standest upon feet of clay. And what is now become of the head of gold which represented the Assyrian? and armes of silver which resembled the Persian? and the thighes of brasse which set forth the Grecian? and the legs of iron which signified the Roman Monar∣chy? Are they not all broken together, and become like chaffe of a summers flower dispersed with the winde? How proudly doth Sennacherib insult over those Nations whom his Ancestors had destroyed?Esay 37.13. Where is the King of Hamath, and the King of Arphad, and the King of the Citie Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivah? Little did he then thinke of a bird from the East, Cyrus by name, that after a short time should chirpe the like note at the Court of the great King of Ashur: Where is the King of Shinar, and the King of Ba∣bylon, and the King of Damascus, and the King of Nineveh, and the great Mo∣narch of Assyria? Whereas he should with Nebuchadnezzar haveDan. 4.34.35. honou∣red for these victories him that liveth for ever, whose Kingdome is from ge∣neration
to generation. And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doth according to his will in the armie of heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What dost thou? Horat. l. 1. car. od. 34.Valet ima summis mutare: & insignem attenuat Deus, hinc apicem rapax fortuna sustulit, hic posuisse gaudet. If the state of Kingdomes and Monarchies is so fickle, what follie, or ra∣ther madnesse is it for any private man to dreame of perpetuities and cer∣tainties, and indefeisable estates? As if a man might be safe in a small cab∣bine under hatches, when the whole Ship is drowned under the water: or a Spider secure in his web, when the whole window is pulled downe: or a young bird out of danger in the nest, when the whole arme of the tree is torne off. All private mens estates are ventered in the bottome of the Com∣mon-wealth, and all Common-wealthes in the great vessell of the earth, which was once swallowed up with a deluge of Water, and shall be ere it be long with a deluge of fire. A house infected with some kinde of Lepro∣sie by the Law was to be pulled downe and burnt to ashes: and when ini∣quitie shall so abound on the earth that the whole world shall be infected with the Leprosie of monstrous and enormous sins, this great house which hath beene long tottered, shall be burned, and fall downe about our eares. And verily if all other signes be accomplished, as many of the learned in their commentaries upon the Apocalyps contend, I should thinke the world cannot long stand: for Juvenal. sat. 1. Quando ub∣rior vitiorum co∣pia? quando Major avaritia patuit sinus, &c Horat. l. 1. car. od. 35. Eheu cicatricū & sceleris pudet, fratrumque quid nos dura refugimus caetas? quid intactum nefasti liqui∣mus?Omne in praecipiti vitium stetit. Every sinne is growne to the height. Atheisme to the height, even in men of high calling: prophanenesse to the height, even on the Lords Sabbaths, and in his holy Temple: Impuritie and immodestie at the height, even da∣ring the consistory: Iniquitie at the height, possessing the place and seat of justice: Drunkennesse at the height, reeling at noone-day: Idolatrie, He∣resie, and Superstition at the height, advancing their followers to the high∣est preferments in the Church, and keeping under pure Religion, and the sin∣cere Professours thereof. It will be said, though plagues fall upon all Egypt, yet Goshen shall be free, though the whole world be destroyed, all Israel shall be saved. Is∣rael is Gods first-borne, who shall dis-inherit him? Israel is the Vine which the right hand of God hath planted, who shall root it up? Israel is the Signet on his finger, who shall plucke it off? Nay, Israel is the apple of his eye, who shall pull it out? Let heaven and earth passe away, yet Gods covenant with Israel shall stand fast; his seed shall endure for ever, and his throne shall bee as the Sunne before God. If these promises stand good unto Israel, this Prophecie of Israels downefall must needs fall to the ground. For how can the Kingdome of Jacob, and the captivitie of Jacob, Israels gathering out of all Nations, and Israels scattering abroad into all Nations, Israels perpetuall standing, and Israels falling and utter subversi∣on stand together?
To compose this seeming difference betweene Gods promises to Israel, and his threats against Israel, we must distinguish of divers kindes of promi∣ses made to Israel, and of divers Israels to which the promises may apper∣taine. Israel sometime signifieth 1. Properly 1. Either the whole posteritie of Jacob: 2. Or the ten tribes which were rent from Roboam. 2. Figuratively The spiritual kingdome of Christ over the Elect. Againe, there is a threefold Israel: 1. According to the flesh onely, of which theRom. 9.6. Rom. 11.25. Apostle spea∣keth expressely; They are not all Israel which are of Israel. And obstinacie is come to Israel.1 Cor. 10.18. Behold Israel after the flesh. 2. Israel according to the Spirit onely.Heb. 8.10. This is the cove∣nant that I will make with the house of Israel after those dayes, I will put my Law into their mindes, and write them in their hearts, &c. and so allRom. 11.26. Israel shalbe saved, for this is my covenant with them when I take away their sinnes. 3. Israel according to the flesh and spirit; which may rightly be called the Israel of Israel, as Demosthenes termeth Athens , the Greece of Greece: to Israel in this third sense Christ had a speciall commission: I am not sent, saith he, but to the lostMath. 10.6. G to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. sheepe of the house of Israel. Saint Paul pointeth to this Israel, when the fulnesse of the Gentiles is come in, allRom. 10.26. Is∣rael shall be saved. And Saint John,Apoc. 7 4. There were sealed an hundreth and fourty and foure thousand of all the Tribes of the children of Israel. Retaine these distinctions of Israel, and put a difference betweene the promises; whereof Some are 1. Absolute, 2. Conditionall. Some are 1. Temporall, 2. Spirituall: and you shall easily reconcile those texts of Scriptures which seeme to overthrow this prophecie concerning the utter overthrow of the Kingdome of Isra∣el, (by which we are here to understand the ten Tribes) which fell out not long after this Prophecie, in the daies of Hosea their last King. As for Judah, theGen. 49.10. Scepter, according to Jacobs prophecy, departed not from it untill Shilo came: but after he came and was rejected of that Nati∣on, and the sacred twig of Jesse was nailed to an accursed tree, God cut it off root and branch by the Romans. Within lesse than halfe an age after our Lords death, Jerusalem bewailed it with bloudie teares, and the Temple rued it: in the ruines, dust, and ashes whereof we may reade this motto: There is no place priviledged from Gods judgement: no Sanctuarie for presumptuous sinners: no protection from arrests taken out of the Court of Heaven. The Palladium saved not Troy from the Greekes,
nor the Arke the Israelites from the Philistims, nor the Temple the Jewes from the Romanes, nor the tombes of Martyrs Rome from the Gothes, nor the Crucifix the Christians in Palestine from Saladine the Sultan of Egypt. God most hateth sinne in them whom he loveth most, and most severely punisheth it in them; as Moses, Job, David, and Saint Paul felt by their owne smart. When the Jewes in Jeremie cryed out,Jer. 7.4. The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, presuming that God would save them for the Temples sake; the Prophet might have answe∣red, Which you have defiled, which you have polluted, which you have propha∣ned. The cry of our sinnes will soone move the justice of heaven (if we stop it not) to turne the mouth of this roaring Cannon towards us. We are, we trust in the God of Israel, the Israel of God: and if we take not their de∣struction to heart, it will prove ours. For we cannot but thus reason with our selves: If God spared not the naturall branches for their unfruitfulnesse, will he spare the engraffed? If judgement beginneth at the house of God, where is it like to end? If God hath sent a bill of divorce to the beloved Citie, and hath quite forsaken his first love, may his latter Spouse the Church of the Gentiles presume to escape better, if she prove alike disloyall? If it hath beene thus done, as before is specified, to the greene tree, what shall bee done to the drie? If Jerusalem be made an example, and the Temple a lamentable spectacle of divine justice, can Babylon and the house of Rim∣mon stand long? If the seven golden Candlestickes placed by Christs owne hand in Asia, and furnished with burning and shining lampes, are removed, and their lights put out, have not we cause to feare that our Candlestickes shall bee removed if we love darkenesse more than light? Did God not spare his owne House, but suffered it to bee burnt to Ashes for the sinnes committed in it? will hee, thinke yee, spare our houses if such wickednesse bee found in them for which hee destroyed the Holy of Holies? But I list not to dwell any longer upon the ruines of Israel: I hasten to the cause of Israels woe. Which as it concerned the Israelites more nearely, so it will come also more home to us; Thou hast destroyed thy selfe: Tu, Te. Praise God O Israel for thy former prosperitie, but now thanke thy selfe for thy imminent desolation.Clem. Alexand. strom. l. 1. . Clemens Alexandrinus observeth acutely that although Theologie, flowing from the fountaine of sacred Scripture, runne all in one channell; yet that many other rivers arising from divers heads and sources fall into it: as for example, in the pro∣per doctrine of this text, that destruction is from our selves, but salvation from God, Morall Philosophie entervaineth with Divinity in that her as∣sertion;Plat. apol. Socr. Anytus & Mile∣tus occidere me possun, laedere non possunt. Nemo laeditur nisi a seipso, no man is hurt but by himselfe. Politie in that observation,Lucan de bello Pharsal. l. 1. In se magna ruunt, Great States as buildings are oppressed with their owne weight, and fall upon themselves. Art milita∣rie in that stratagem intus Equus Trojanus, that Trojane horse is within the walls which ruines the Citie. The sword of the enemie draweth out but a little corrupt bloud, that may bee well spared: it is sedition and intestine warre that giveth the State her deathes wound.

Eagle starved by his ra∣venous feeding, which makes his bill grow so big that he cannot open it wide enough to receive in food? The historie of all times brings in evi∣dence of fact to confirme the truth of this observation in humane affaires. Sodome might have stood for all the five Kings that bid her battaile, if the unnaturall fire of lust had not drawne downe upon her unnaturall fire, I meane the fire of hell, asSalvin. de gubern. Dei. l. 1. Deus voluit declarar udi∣cium qando super impium populum Ge∣hennam misit de coelo. Salvian speaketh, from heaven. Troy might have stood a thousand yeeres for all the Grecian Fleet of a thousand ships, if An∣tenor had not by trechery opened the Scean gate, and the Inhabitants upon the unexpected remove of the Fleet throwne their houses out at the windowes; whereof the Greekes having intelligence Virg. Aen 2.Invadunt Urbem somno vinoque sepultam: surprise the Citie, partly in a dead sleepe, partly dead drunke. It was not Dan's vigilancie, butJudg. 18.27. And they came unto Laish, unto a people that were quiet and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the City with fire. Laish her securitie that exposed her to spoile. It was notXen Cyr. poed. Cyrus his valour and prowesse, but Babylons effeminatenesse and luxu∣rie that subdued it: the Citizens kept a feast, and their King Belshazzar was quaffing in the bowles of the Sanctuary, when the Persians stole in upon them and slew them like beasts. They were not Fabius his souldiers, but Capua's pleasures which conqueredCapua Hanni∣bali Cannae. Hannibal. It was not Titus his siege without, but the Zelots sedition within the walls that dispeopled Jerusalem, strowing her streets with carkasses, and dying her common Seurs with bloud. It was not the Turkes puissance, but the covetousnesse of the Citi∣zens of Constantinople which made it a prey to the enemie, as the Turk him∣selfe confessed, when in the sacking of the City, and rifling the houses, he found such a masse of treasure as might have easily secured the place if the owners would have contributed but a small part of it to the maintenance of the Greeke Emperours warre against the Saracens. And to come neerer my text, it was not the Assyrians horse and chariots, but Jeroboams gol∣den calves, together with their sorcerie, witchcraft, and other sinnes discovered unto them by the Prophets Amos and Hosea, but unre∣pented of, which destroyed Israel. It is true which Arnobius affirmeth,
that weArnob. adver. gent. l. 2. Procul absit tam scele∣rata persuasio, ut rerum omni∣um salus Deus ulli rei fuerit miseriarum aut discriminum causa. may by no meanes staine the decrees of God with any aspersion of bloudy cruelty, or impute to him the miseries which befall us: and yet God by his ProphetAmos 3.6. Amos demandeth, Shall there bee any evill in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?Salv. de pro∣videntia l. 8. A Deo quippe punimur, sed ipsi facimus ut puniamur, cum autem punire nos ipsi faci∣mus, cui dubitum est, quin ipsi nos nostris cri∣minibus puni∣amus, vim Deo faciamus ini∣quitatibus no∣stris, & ipsi in nos iram Dei armamus. Salvianus excellently accordeth the seeming difference betweene these assertions; God is the cause, and wee are the cause of our woe; God punisheth us, and wee punish our selves: God indeed punisheth us, but wee cause, and after a sort force him to doe it: God inflicteth stripes, but wee deserve them: God striketh, but wee provoke: God powreth out the vials of his wrath, but wee fill them up to the brimme by our over-flowing iniquities. God maketh us good if wee are so: but in a true sense wee make him just, (and which may seeme a great Para∣doxe) even by our injustice. For if wee were not unjust in transgressing, God could not bee just in punishing; neither would hee desire any way to exalt his glory by the ruine of his creature. For he delighteth in mercy, (Micah 7.18.) and goodnesse is his nature. Hee therefore never sendeth e∣vill upon us before we have it in us, hee never fils us a cup ofPsal. 75.8. In the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full of mixture, and he powreth out of the same. red wine be∣fore the measure of our crimson sinne is full; neither powreth hee out the dregges of his wrath upon any, but such as Moab-like are settled upon their lees, Zeph. 1.12. To strike saile then, and land my discourse: If our Israel, if the Scep∣ter of our Moses, and the Rod of our Aarons flourish not as in former times, if the people bee multiplied, and yet our joy not increased, if our corne, and wine, and oyle abound, and yet wee are not enriched, if the publike weale and every mans private, by some secret veine inwardly blee∣ding, hath beene in a kinde of consumption, if our State hath received any wound, or our Church any blow, wee know where to lay the blame: wee must say with mournefull Jerusalem,Lam. 1.8. The Lord is righteous, but wee have rebelled against him: God hath beene good to us, but wee have rewarded evill unto our selves: God hath not forgotten to bee gracious, but wee to bee thankefull: God would bee better to us if wee were better: Hor. car. l. 1. od. 3.Sed nos per nostrum non patimur scelus Iracunda Deum ponere fulmina. Doth any desire to know how it commeth to passe that our gold is not so pure? our silver so bright? our brasse and iron so strong as here∣tofore? that is, the honour of our Nobility, the riches of our Gen∣try, the vertue and strength of our Commonalty is much empaired. If I and all Preachers should bee silent, ourSen. de ira l. 2. Nec furtiva jam scelera sunt, praeter o∣culos eunt, & in publicum missa nequitia est. loud sinnes would proclaime it, blasphemy would speake it, prophanenesse sweare it, pride and vanity paint and print it, usury and bribery tell it, luxury vent it, gluttony and drunken∣nesse belch it out. St. Peters argument were now of no force, these men are not drunke, seeing that it is but the third houre of the day: for all houres of day, yea and night too, are alike to many of our drunkards.Tacit. annal. l. 3. Praestat o∣mittere prae va∣lida & adulta vi∣tia, quam id as∣sequi ut palam fiat quibus viti∣is impares si∣mus. Tibe∣rius his advice in Tacitus may passe in point of policy for good, viz. to dissemble and conceale overgrowne and head-strong evils, rather than by tax∣ing them to make it knowne what vices have so got the masterie of us, that wee
cannot stand against them: but religion allowes of no such politicke si∣lence. God layeth this burthen upon his Prophets, to burthen all sorts of men with all sorts of sin, and to tell the greatest Potentates upon the earth, that Potentespotenter, that the mighty shall bee mightily tormented; that theApoc. 19.18. fowles that flie in the midst of heaven shall eat the flesh of Kings, and the flesh of Captaines, and the flesh of mighty men. The lowder our sinnes cry, the higher we must lift up our voice like a trumpet to cry them downe, even by thundering Gods judgements against them. PopePlat. in vita Silv. Silvester when he was bid beware of Jerusalem, for that when∣soever hee should come thither, hee should certainly dye, he flattered him∣selfe that hee should put off his death long enough, because hee was sure that he never meant to travell into Palestine, little thinking that there was a Church at Rome of that name, into which hee had no sooner set his foot, but hee met with his evill Genius, as Brutus did at Philippi, and suddenly ended his wretched dayes. Suffer I beseech you the word of admoniti∣on and exhortation: It is not Rome in Italy which we need so much to feare, though it bee the Seminary of Heretickes and Traytors; but Rome in Eng∣land, Rome at home; I meane the Popish faction among us, which casteth continually fire-balls of dissention in the State, and of Schisme in the Church, to set all in a combustion.Cant. 2.15. O take away the foxes, the little foxes that spoile the grapes of that far spreading vine which God hath planted among us by his word, and watered by the bloud of so many noble Martyrs. But I feare to lance any publicke sores any deeper: let mee give but a pricke at our private wheales, and then I will soone rid you and my selfe of paine. Beloved, wee are all querulous, yet none almost either knoweth or looketh after the cause of their woe. One complaineth that hee goeth backward in the world, and sinketh in his estate, and hee lay∣eth all the blame either upon bad servants, or theevish neighbours, or racking Land-lords, or hard times, or some losses by sea or land; but never looketh into his owne heart, where the true cause lyes, be it co∣vetousnesse, or distrust of Gods providence, or a quarrelling dispositi∣on, or pride, or idlenesse, or luxurie, or sacriledge. Another is still whi∣ning that hee cannot get or keepe his health, and he imputeth this either to his crazie constitution by nature, or ill ayre, or over much labour and stu∣dy; whereas indeed the cause is his ill diet, his sitting up all night at Re∣vels, his powring in strong wines, and spending the greatest part of the day in Tavernes, his intemperancy or incontinency. All other sinnes are without the body, but hee that1 Cor. 6.18. committeth fornication sinneth a∣gainst his owne body. First, against the honour of his body; for thereby he maketh the members of Christ the members of an harlot: next, the strength, health, and life of the body, which nothing more enfee∣bleth, empaireth, and endangereth, than greedily drinking stolne waters, and coveting after strange flesh. A third is troubled in minde, and hee feeleth no comfort in his conscience, the good spirit hath left him, and the evill spirit haunteth him, and scorcheth his soule with the flashes of Hell fire; and hee ascribeth this to some melancholy bloud, or worldly dis∣content, or the indiscretion of some Boanerges, sonnes of thunder, who preach nothing but damnation to their hearers; whereas the true cause
is in himselfe; hee grieveth the spirit of grace, hee turneth it into wan∣tonnesse, and quencheth the light of it in himselfe; and therefore God withdraweth this holy Comforter from him for a time. WhenJust. hist. l. 1. Zopyrus qui si∣bi labia & na∣res praecidi cu∣rasset, queritur crudelitatem Regis. Zopyrus had cut his owne lips and nose, he gave it out that the Babylonians had so barbarously used him: such is the condition of most men; they disfigure their soules, dismember their bodies by monstrous sinnes, and yet lay the whole blame upon others.Mat. 10.36. The enemies of a man, saith our Saviour, are those of his owne house. So it is, so it is, saith S.Bern med. c. 13. Accusat me conscientia, te∣stis est memo∣ria, ratio judex, voluptas car∣cer, timor tor∣tor, oblecta∣mentum tor∣mentum, inde enim punimur unde oblecta∣mur. Bernard, in mine owne house, in my proper family; nay, within my selfe I have my accuser, my judge, my witnesse, my tormentor. My conscience is the accuser, my memory the wit∣nesse, my reason the judge, my feare the torturer, my sinfull delights my torments.Camerar. med. hist. cent. 1. c. 20. Plancus Plautius hiding himselfe in the time of the proscription, was found out onely by the smell of his sweet oyles wherewith hee used luxuriously to anoint himselfe,Eras. adag. Sorex ut dicitur suo indicio. Sylla hea∣ring some displeasing newes, was so enflamed with anger, that streining himselfe to utter his passion, he brake a veine, and spitting bloud died. Re∣member the words of dying Caesar, when hee felt their daggers at his heart whom he had saved from the sword; Mene servare ut sint qui me perdant! O that I should save men to doe mee such a mischiefe! O that wee should harbour those snakes in our bosomes, which, if wee long keepe them there, will sting us to death! A strange thing it is, and much to bee la∣mented, that the soule should prescribe remedies against the maladies of the bodie, and yet procure nourishment for her owne diseases. What are the vitious affections we feed and cherish within us, but so many pernitious infections of the minde? What is anger, but a fit of a frenzie? feare, but a shking feaver? ambition, but a winde collicke? malice, but an apostem? faction, but a convulsion? envie, but a consumption? security, but a dead palsie? lust, but an impure itch? immoderate joy, but a pleasing trance of the soule? These are the greatest causes of our woe, not onely because they disturbe the peace of our conscience, and set us upon scandalous and dange∣rous actions; but also because they draw upon us heavie and manifold judgements. From which if we desire to be freed, that they prove not our utter destruction, let us First, confesse our sinnes with David to be the fuell of Gods wrath, and the fountaine of all our miseries:Psal. 51.4. Against thee, thee onely have wee sinned, and done this, and that, and the third, and many more evils in thy sight, that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and cleere when thou art judged: and withSalv. l. 4. de provid. Sive mi∣seae nostrae sint. sive infir∣mitates, sive e∣versiones &c. testimoni sunt mali servi & boni domini: quomodo mali servi? quia pa∣timur ex parte quod meremur: quomodo boni domini? quia ostendit quid mereamur, sed non irrogat quae meremur. Salvianus, Whatsoever our miseries are, or afflictions, or perse∣cutions, or overthrowes, or losses, or diseases, they are testimonies of an evil servant and a good master. How of an evill servant? Because in them we suf∣fer in part what wee deserve. How testimonies of a good master? Because by them he sheweth us what wee deserve, and yet layeth not upon us so much as we deserve. Secondly, let us compose our selves to endure that with patience which we have brought upon our selves: Tute in hoc tristi tibi omne exedendum est. Thirdly, let us forsake our beloved sinnes, and then God will take a∣way his plagues from us: let us be better our selves, and all things shall goe better with us: let repentance be our practise, and a speedy reformati∣on
our instruction, so Gods judgements shall not bee our destruction. Now O Father of mercy and tender compassion in the bowels of Je∣sus Christ, who hast shewed us what wee deserve by our sinnes, and yet hast not rewarded us according to our iniquities, take away our stony hearts from us, and give us hearts of flesh, that thy threats may make a deepe impression in us, and that wee may speedily remove the evill of our sinnes out of thy sight, that thou maist remove the e∣vill of punishment from us: so our sinne shall not be our destruction, but thy mercy our salva∣tion through Jesus Christ.

THE CHARACTERS OF HEAVENLY WISEDOME. A Sermon preached before his Grace, and di∣vers other Lords and Judges spirituall and temporall, in Lambeth. THE EIGHTH SERMON. PSAL. 2.10. Be wise now therefore, O yee Kings: be instructed yee Judges of the earth. Most Reverend, Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. THe mirrour of humane eloquence apologizing for his undertaking the defence of Murena against Cato the el∣der pertinently demandethCic. pro Muren. A quo tandem Marce Cato ae∣quius est defen∣di Consulem quam a Con∣sule? who so fit a patron of a Con∣sull as a consull himselfe? The like may be said in the ju∣stification of King Davids lesson read in my text to Princes and Judges; a quo tandem aequius est doceri Reges quam a Rege? erudiri Judices quam a Judice? Who so proper to tutour Kings as a King? who might better give Judges their charge than the chiefe Judge and Soveraigne Justice in his Kingdome? Not onely nature and bloud, but arts also and professions make a kinde of brotherhood: and an admonition that commeth from a man in place to an∣other in like place and office, (that is, spoken by authority to authority) carrieth a double authority, and cannot but be entertained with due respect and carefull regard. Therefore God in his wisedome instructed the Pro∣phet David by2. Sam. 7.3.5. Nathan a Prophet, reproved the Apostle SaintGal. 2.14. Peter by Paul an Apostle, informed John theApoc. 7.14. Elder by an Elder, and here adviseth
Kings by a King. Be wise now therefore, O ye Kings: be learned yee Judges of the earth. In this verse we have 1. A lesson applied, Of wisedome to Kings. Of instruction to Judges. 2. A reason implied in the words of the earth; that is, Either Kings and Judges made of earth, Or made Kings and Judges of earth. Kings and Judges are but men of earth, earthly and therefore in subje∣ction to the God of heaven: and they are made Kings and Judges onely of the earth, that is, earthly and humane affaires, and therefore in subordina∣tion to divine and heavenly Lawes. For the order, first King David com∣mendeth wisedome to Kings, and then instruction or learning, viz. in the Lawes, to Judges. Kings are above Judges, and wisedome, the glorie of a Prince, above learning, the honour of a Judge. Kings make Judges, and wisdome makes learned: as the power of Kings is the source of the autho∣ritie of Judges, so wisedome is the fountaine of all lawes, and consequently of all instruction and learning in them. First therefore be wise O ye Kings to make good Lawes, and then be learned O ye Judges in these Lawes, and found Yee your wisedome, Yee your learning in humility: for it is earth not onely upon which your consistory stands, but also of which you your selves consist. As the tongue is moved partly by a muscle in it selfe, partly by an artery from the heart: so besides the motive to these vertues in this verse it selfe, there is a reason drawne by the spirit to enforce these duties from the heart of this Psalme, ver. 6. which is like an artery con∣veying spirit and life to this admonition here: Yet have I set my King, &c. as if the Prophet had said, Behold, O Kings, a throne above yours set in the starres: behold, O Judges of the earth, a tribunall or judgement seat above yours established in the clouds. There is a King of heaven by whom all earthly Kings reigne, and a Judge of quicke and dead to whom all Judges of the earth are accountable. Horat. od. car. l. 3. od. 1.Regum timendorum in proprios greges, Reges in ipsos imperium est Jovis. Kings are dreadfull to their subjects, God to Kings: Judges call other men to the barre, but Christ Jesus shall summon all Judges one day to his tribu∣nall,Cyp. de mortal. justissimè judicaturus a quibus est injustissimè judicatus, most justly to judge Judges by whom both in himselfe and in his members he hath beene most unjustly judged. O Kings. The more excellent the office the more eminent the qualitie ought to be: no vertue so befits a Prince as religious wisedome, the Queen of all vertues: be wise therefore O yee Kings, excell in the grace which
excelleth all others: crowne your royall dignitie with all Princely ver∣tues, and chaine them all together in prudence with the linkes follow∣ing. Serve the Lord with feare, feare him with joy, rejoyce in him with love, and love him with confidence. First, serve him not carelesly, but sollici∣tously, fearing to displease him. Secondly, feare him, not servilely, but fi∣lially, with joy. Thirdly, rejoyce in him, not presumptuously, but awful∣ly, with trembling. Fourthly, Tremble before him, not desperately, but hopefully; so feare him in his judgements, that ye embrace him in his mercies, and kisse him in the face of Jesus Christ. Though he frowne on you in his anger, yet still seeke to please him: yea, though he smite you in his wrath, and kill you all the day long, yet put your trust in him and you shall be happie. Be wise. Wisedome is the mindesArist. Eth.  eye, by which she pryeth into all the secrets of nature, and mysteries of State, and discerneth betweene good and evill, and prudently guideth all the affaires of life, as the helme doth a ship. No good can be done without her direction, nor evill bee avoyded but by her forecast. She is the chiefe of the foure cardinall vertues, and may rightly be stiled Cardinalium cardo, the hinge that turnes them all a∣bout. They advance not till she strikes an alarum, nor retire till she sound a retreat. What the Apostle speakes of the three heavenly graces, now there1 Cor. 13.13. remaine these three, faith, hope, and charity, but the greatest of these is charitie; may be in like manner affirmed concerning the preheminence of wisedome in respect of the other cardinall vertues, now there remaine these foure: 1. Wisedome to direct, 2. Justice to correct, 3. Temperance to abstaine, 4. Fortitude to sustaine; but the greatest of these is wisedome. For wisedome informeth justice, moderateth temperance, and leadeth fortitude. Wisedome giveth rules to justice, setteth bounds to temperance, putteth reines on fortitude. With∣out wisedome justice hurteth others, temperance our selves,Horat. od. car. l. fortitude both our selves and others. Isoc. ad Demon. .Vis consili expers mole ruit sua. SaintBernard. ser. 85. in cant. Sapien∣tia a sapore di∣cta est quia vir∣tuti velut con∣dimentum ac∣cedens sapidam reddit. Bernard deriveth sapientia a sapore, sapience from sapour, because wisedome giveth a good rellish to vertue. Discretion is the salt of all our actions, without which nothing that is done or spoken is savourie. What doth pregnancie of wit, or maturitie of judgement, or felicitie of memorie, or varietie of reading, or multiplicitie of observation, or gracefulnesse of deliverie steed a man that wanteth wisedome and discretion to use them? In these respects and many more Solomon the wisest King that ever wore corruptible Crowne, in his prayer to God preferreth wisedome to all o∣ther gifts whatsoever. And indeed so admirable a vertue, so rare a perfe∣ction, so inestimable a treasure it is, that the heathen who had but a glimpse of it, discover it to be a beame of that light which no man can approach unto,
Cic. Tus. quaest.haec est una hominis sapientia, non arbitrarite scire quod nescias: this is the chiefest point of mans wisedome, saith Tully out of Socrates his mouth, to have no opinion of his wisedome, but to know that undoubtedly he knoweth nothing, at least as he ought to know. Justinian, though a great Emperour, could not avoid the censure of folly for calling his wife by the name of Sapientia; because, saith Saint Austin, nomen illud augu∣stius est quam ut homini conveniat: because the name of wise, and much more of wisedome in the abstract, is too high a title for any on earth to beare. What greater folly then can be imagined in any man or woman to assume wisedome to themselves, whose greatest wisedome consisteth in the humble acknowledgement of their follies and manifold oversights? Therefore Lactantius wittily comes over the seven wise masters, as they are called, whom antiquity no lesse observed than Sea-men doe the se∣ven Starres about the North Pole. When, saith he,Lact. . 4. divin. instit. 1. Sicae∣ter omnes praeter ipsos stulti fuernt, ne illi quidem sa∣pientes, quane∣ sapiens ve∣e stltorum ju∣dicio esse potest. there were but se∣ven wise men in all the world, I would faine know in whose judgement they were held so, in their owne or the judgement of others; if in the judgement of others, then of fooles, by their owne supposition em∣paling all wisedome within the breasts of those seven: if in their owne judgement they were esteemed the onely wise of that age, then must they needs be fooles; for no such foole as he who is wise in his owne conceit. This consideration induced Socrates to pull downe his crest, and re∣nounce the name of a wise man, and exchange Sophon into Philosophon, the name of Sophister into Philosopher, of wise into a lover of wise∣dome, with which title all that succeeded him in his Schoole of wise∣dome contented themselves. When theSphinx Philo∣soph. c. 7. Gryphus. Milesian Fishermen drew up in their net a massie piece of gold in the forme of a Table or planke, there grew a great strife and contention in Law whose that draught should be, whether the Fishermens who rented the fishing in that river, or the Lords of the soyle and water. In the end, fearing on all hands lest this Altar of gold should melt away in law charges, they deferre the judge∣ment of this controversie to Apollo, who by his Oracle answered, that it neither appertained to the Fishermen, nor to the Lord of the Mannor, but ought to bee delivered as a present to the wisest man then living. Whereupon this golden Table was first tendered to Thales the Milesian, who sendeth it to Bias, Bias to Solon, Solon in the end to Apollo, whom the heathen adored as the God of wisdome. By this shoving of the Ta∣ble from wise man to wise man, and in the end fixing it in the Temple of Apollo, they all in effect subscribed to the judgement of him who thus concludes his Epistle, ToRom 16.27. 1 Tim. 1.17. To the King immor∣tall, invisible, the onely wise God be honour and glory for ever and ever. God onely wise bee glory for ever. And questionlesse, if wee speake of perfect and absolute wisedome, it must bee adored in heaven, not sought for on the earth. Hee alone knoweth all things, who made all things: hee comprehendeth them in his science, who containeth them in his essence. Yet ought we to seeke for the wise∣dome here meant as for treasure: and although wee may not hope in this life to be wise unto perfection, yet may we and ought we to know the ho∣ly Scriptures which are able to make us2 Tim. 3.15. wise unto salvation. In these we find a fourefold wisedome mentioned: 1. Godly, 1. Godly wisedome is piety: 2. Worldly, 2. Worldly wisedome is policy: 3. Fleshly, 3. Fleshly wisedome is sensuality: 4. Divelish. 4. Divelish wisedome is mischievous subtlety. 1. Godly wisedome is here meant, as the words following make it evi∣dent, Serve the Lord with feare; and reason makes it yet more evident. For the Prophet needed not to exhort Princes to worldly wisdome, the point of Policie is too well studied by them: nor to fleshly wisdome, for they most∣ly take but too much care to fulfill their lusts, and maintain their Port, and provide for their temporall peace and safetie. As for divellish wisedome, which makes men wise to doeJer. 4.22. evill, so holy a Prophet as David was would not so much as have taken it in his lips, unlesse peradventure to brand it with the note of perpetuall infamie. The wisedome therefore which he here commendeth to Kings is a godly, a holy, and a heavenly wisedome. A wisedome which beginneth in the feare of God, and endeth in the salva∣tion of man. A wisedome that rebuketh the wisedome of the flesh, and de∣spiseth the wisedome of the world, and confoundeth the wisedome of the Divell. A wisedome that advertiseth us of a life after this life, and a death after this death, and sheweth us the meanes to attaine the one, and avoid the other. Morall or civill wisedome is as the eye of the soule, but this wise∣dome the Spirit here preferreth to Kings, is the eye of the spirit. Ubi desi∣nit Philosophus ibi incipit Medicus, where the Philosopher ends there the spi∣rituall Physician begins. The highest step of humane wisedome is but the lowest and first of divine. As Moses his face shined after he communed with God, so all morall and intellectuall vertues, after we have communi∣on with Christ, and he commeth neere to us by his spirit, receive a new lustre from supernaturall grace. Prudence or civill wisedome is in the soule as a precious diamond in a ring; but spirituall wisedome is like Solis jubar, the Sunnes rayes falling upon this Diamond, wonderfully beautifying and illustrating it. Of this heavenly light, at this time by the eye-salve of the Spirit cleering our sight, wee will display five beames. 1. The first, to beginne with our end, and to provide for our eternall estate after this life in the first place. For here we stay but a while, and be our condition what it will be, it may be altered: there wee must a∣bide by it, without any hope of change. Here wee slide over the Sea of glasse mentioned in theApoc. 15.2. And I saw as it were a sea of glasse. Apocalyps, but there we stand immoveable in our stations: here we are like wandring starres erraticke in our motions, there we are fixed for ever, either as starres in heaven to shine in glorie, or as brandirons in hell to glowe in flames. Therefore undoubtedly the unum necessarium, the one thing above all things to be thought upon is, what shall become of us after we goe hence, and be no more seene. The heathen saw the light of this truth at a chincke as it were, who being demanded why they built for themselves glorious sepulchres, but low and base houses, answered, because in the one they sojourned but for a short space, in the other they dwelt. To this Solomon had an eye when hee termeth
the grave mansEccles. 12.5. Man goeth to his long home, and the morners goe a∣bout the streets. long home; and a greater than Solomon, when he infor∣meth his Disciples that in hisJoh 14.2. Fathers house there are many mansions, that is, standing or abiding places. Such are many in heaven built upon preci∣ous stones, but none on earth: here we have onely stands for an houre, or boothes for a Faire, or bowers for a dance, or at the most Innes for a bait.Eccles. 3.2. There is a time, saith the wise man, to bee borne, and a time to die: what, and no time betwixt? sometimes none at all, as in those that are still-borne: if it be any, as sometimes it is, he makes no reckoning of it, but joynes death immediately to our birth, as if they were contigu∣ous, and our cradles stood in our grave. The space betweene our birth and death, be it extended to the longest period, is but a moment in respect of eternity, and yet ex hoc momento pendet aeternitas, upon the well or ill employing of this moment dependeth our eternitie. I will tell you a strange thing saithSen ep. ad Lucil. Seneca, Many die before they begin to live. I can tell you a stranger thing, many die before ever they thinke of the true life. These, howsoever they may carry the name of wise and great States-men, yet when it will be too late they shall see their folly farre to exceed that of the simplest Idiot in the world: when at the houre of their death fin∣ding that they have laid out their whole stocke of wealth and wit in pur∣chasing and furnishing a chamber in a thorough fare, and provided them∣selves no house in the Citie, where they are for ever to abide, shall cry out in the bitternesse of their soule, either withCarion. in Cron. Severus, Omnia fui, & nihil profui; I have beene all things, and yet have done no good at all: or with Adrian, Sphinx Philos.O animula vagula blandula hospes comes{que} corporis, quae nunc abibis in loca! &c. O my pretty soule, the pleasant guest and companion of my bodie, in∣to what places shalt thou now goe, naked, cold, and trembling! or with the afflicters of the righteous;Wisd. 5.8, 9, 10.13. What hath pride profited us? or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us? All these things are passed away like a shadow, and like a post that hasteth by. And as a Ship that passeth over the waves of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot bee found, neither the path-way of the keele in the waves: Even so wee in like manner, as soone as wee were borne, began to draw to our end, and had no signe of vertue to shew, but were consumed in our owne wickednesse. I like well of his resoluti∣on who said, , I hate that wise man, whose wisedome reflects not upon himselfe, who is no whit bettered by his wisedome. Hee cannot bee wise who is not provident: hee is not provident who prepares not a place for his soule after shee is dis∣lodged of the bodie. Hee is no thriftie man who lavisheth out his time, and spendeth his strength in pursuing shadowes, when with lesse paine and cost hee might have purchased a substantiall and indefeisable estate: hee is no good husband who taketh perpetuall care for his temporall affaires, and taketh little or none at any
time for his spirituall and eternall; who gathereth treasure upon earth, where rust andMatth. 7.19. moth doth corrupt, and theeves breake thorough and steale; and lay∣e up no treasure in heaven, where neither rust nor moth doth corrupt, and theeves doe not breake thorough and steale: who drives a great and rich trade in forraine parts, and returnes no money by letters of exchange, sent by the hands of the poore, to be repaid him upon his return into his country in hea∣ven: who travels sea and land to dig into the bowels of the earth, yea and sometimes rakes hell also for unrighteousLuke 16.9. Mammon, and when he hath great store of it, makes no friends with it, that when he failes they may re∣ceive him into everlasting habitations. 2. The second precept is to informe our selves certainely how we stand in the Court of heaven, whether recti in curia or no: to know by the refle∣ction of grace in our soules, whether Gods countenance shine upon us, or there be a cloud betweene it and us. For as thePlin. nat. hist. l. 9. c. 35. Coeli iis major socie∣tas est quam maris, inde nu∣bilum trahunt colorem aut pro claritate matutina sere∣num. Margarite or pearle hath such affinity with the skie, that if it be bred at the opening of the shell fish in a cleere morning, the colour thereof is cleere, and the stone most orient: but if in a duskie evening, or when the heaven is over-cast with clouds, the colour thereof is darker, and the stone lesse precious: so the hidden man of the heart is lightsome and cheerefull when Gods face shines upon him, but sad and dejected when heaven lowres upon him. Without assurance that we are in the state of grace, and reconciled to God in Christ, there is no com∣fort in life and death, because no sound joy, nor settled peace within. Neither is it so easie a matter as some imagine to get this assurance, or the know∣ledge thereof. For not onely the sicke patient, but also sometimes the skil∣full Physician is deceived in the state of our bodie, though all ordinary dis∣eases have their certaine symptomes by which they may be knowne, even to sense: how much more difficult a thing is it certainely to judge of the state of our soule? A man may set a good face on it, as Tiberius did, and brave it out, yea and riot also, who yet hath such a secret disease which will make an end of him in a few houres. Nay, a man may take infection, or receive some bruise inwardly, or spring some veine, and yet not know of it till it be too late to cure it: in like maner, a man that maketh great profession of Religion, and carrieth a great appearance of piety and sanctity, both at Church and in his owne house, feeling no inward gripe of conscience, may yet have taken some infection of Heresie, or have still in him some poyson of malice, or bruise of faction, or rupture of schisme, or corrupt humours of luxurie, and daily decay in grace, and be in a spirituall con∣sumption, and yet perceive it not. I have no commission to ransacke a∣ny mans conscience, nor to make privie search for concealed Idols, or masqued hypocrisie, or vailed impudencie, or closely conveyed bribe∣ry, or secretly vented luxurie, or statutable usurie, or legall simonie, or customary sacriledge. Onely I will bee bold to say the least breach which any of the above named sinnes make in the conscience, is like a small leake in the bottome of a Ship, which, if it be not stopped in time, will drowne the greatest vessell, fraught with the richest merchandise. Your experience sheweth you that Bristow and Cornish stones, and many other false gems, have such a lustre in them, and so sparkle like true jewels, that a cunning Lapidarie, if he be not carefull, may be cheated with them:
such are the enlightning graces which shine in hypocrites, they so neerly resemble the true sanctifying and saving graces of the Elect, that the eye of spirituall wisedome it selfe may mistake them, if it be not single, and looke narrowly into them. Are not repentance from dead workes, faith in Christ, peace of conscience, and joy in the holy Ghost, the proper characters of a regenerate Christian and an elect childe of God? Yet Esau counterfeited the first: (theHeb 12.17. Apostle saith that after he had sold his birth-right he sought it with teares.) Simon Magus the second: (St. Luke saith heActs 8.13. beleeved.) The man possessed in the Gospell the third: (our Saviour saith all things were inLuke 11.21. peace in his house.) The Jewes the fourth: (the text saith theyJoh. 5 35. re∣joyced at St. Johns preaching.) Here then is worke for spirituall wisedome to discerneGib. in Cant.

The third point of spirituall wisedome is, to consider what infirmities and maladies of minde our naturall constitution, state, place, or profession, or course of life maketh us most subject unto, and to furnish our selves with store of remedies against them; to mark where we lie most open to temptation, and there to have our ward readie. For Satan playeth alwayes upon advan∣tage, and for the most part boweth us that way to which we incline of our selves, through the weakenesse of our nature: he sailes ever with the wind. Is our knowledge in matter of faith deficient? he tempts us to error. Is our conscience tender? he tempteth us to scrupulositie and too much precise∣nesse. Hath our conscience like the eclipticke line some latitude? he temp∣teth us to carnall libertie. Are we bold spirited? he tempteth us to pre∣sumption. Are we timorous and distrustfull? he tempteth us to desperati∣on? Are we of a flexible disposition? he tempteth us to inconstancie. Are we stiffe? he labours to make obstinate Heretikes, Scismatikes, or Rebels of us. Are we of an austere temper? he tempteth us to crueltie? Are we soft and milde? he tempteth us to indulgence and foolish pitie. Are we hot in matter of Religion? he tempteth us to blind zeale and superstition. Are we cold? he tempteth us to Atheisme and flat irreligion. Are we moderate? he tempteth us to Laodicean lukewarmednesse. The Camelion when he lieth on the grasse to catch flies and grashoppers, taketh upon him the co∣lour of the grasse; as the Polypus doth the colour of the rock, under which he lurketh, that the fish may boldly come neere him without any suspi∣tion of danger: in like maner Sathan turnes himselfe into that shape which we least feare, and sets before us such objects of temptation as are most a∣greeable to our humours, naturall desires, and inclinations, that so he may the sooner draw us into his net. St.Greg. l. 29. mor. in Job. c. 38. Prius consper∣sionem uniuscu∣jus{que} antiquus adversarius perspicit, & tunc tentationis laqueos appo∣nit, alius nam{que} laeti, alius tri∣stibus, alius ti∣midis, alius cla∣ris moribus ex∣istit. Qu ergo occultus adver∣sarius facile ca∣piat vicinas conspersioni∣bus deceptiones parat. Quia e∣nim laetitiae voluptas juxta est, laetis mori∣bus luxuriem proponit & quia tristitia in iam facile labitur, tristibus poculum dis∣cordiae porrgit, paventibus ter∣rores intntat, & quia ela os extolli laudibus conspicit, eos blandis favoribus trahit: singulis igitur hominibus vitiis convenientibus insidiatur. Gregorie long agoe noted this subtle de∣vice of the wily serpent, he hath, saith he, fit allurements for all sorts of men, as fishermen have baits for fishes: for the luxurious he baiteth his hooke with pleasure; for the ambitious, with honor; for the covetous with gain; for the
licentious with libertie, for the factious with schisme, for the studious with curiosity, for the vaine-glorious with popularity. Here then is our spiritu∣all wisedome seene to be strong alwayes, there where our enemie is like to lie in ambush, and where he goeth about to undermine us, to meet him with a countermine. To unfold this precept of wisdome even to the meanest ca∣pacity: Art thou by nature a lover of pleasure? bend thy whole strength against the sin of luxurie. Art thou of a fiery disposition? lay all upon it to bridle thy passion of anger, and desire of revenge. Hast thou too much earth in thy complexion, and art given to the world? furnish thy selfe continually with spirituall levers to lift up thy heart, and raise thy thoughts and affections to heaven and heavenly objects. Doth the eminencie of thy place bring thee in danger of high mindednesse? let thy whole study bee humility. Doth thy profession incline thee to contention? study peace: to dissembling and cousening? study honesty: to extortion and exaction? study charity, and practise restitution: to corruption and receiving the wa∣ges of iniquity? let all thy prayers and endeavours be for integrity. Socrates was wont say, facile est Athenienses Athenis laudare, that it was no unpleasing argument to commend the vertues of the Athenians at Athens: neither will it seeme burthensome I hope to recommend yet more instructions of wisedome to you that are wise. God hath spread abroad the heaven and the earth as large samplars before our eyes, wherein every act of his speciall providence in governing the affaires of the world is as a flower or curious piece of drawne-worke, which a wise man ought to take out by observation, and worke it in his owne life by imitation. 4. The fourth lesson therefore which wisedome readeth to all those that have eares to heare, is to observe the carriage of all affaires in this great City of the world, and to set a marke upon Gods wonderfull protection and care over the godly, and his fearefull judgements upon the wicked. From the former spiri∣tuall wisdome gathereth the sweet fruit of comfort, from the latter the bit∣ter fruit of terror, from both the most wholesome fruit of instruction. The fruit of comfort she gathereth by using Jacobs ladder to rest upon, when she is weary, Hagars fountaine to quench her thirst, the widowes meale to sustaine her in famine, Jonah's gourd to shade her in heat, Jonathans hony to cleere her eye-sight, Hezekia's figs to heale her plague-sores, the Sama∣ritan's oyle to supple her wounds, and Christs Crosse to support her in all. The bitter fruit of terrour she gathereth when she maketh the drow∣ning of the old world a warning to her for security, the confusion of Lan∣guages at Babel for pride, the burning of Sodome for unnaturall lust, the pil∣lar of salt into which Lot's wife was turned for backsliding and disobedi∣ence, the plagues of Egypt for hardness of heart, the captivity of Israel and Ju∣dah for Idolatry, and the finall destruction of the City and Temple for in∣fidelity, and persecution of Christ and his Gospell. When the Divell offe∣reth us any forbidden fruit, seem it never so pleasant to the eye, let us thinke of Adam; when a wedge of gold, of Achan; when red broth, of Esau; when a pleasant vineyard lying neere to our house, of Ahab; when a bribe, of Ge∣hazi; when holy vessels to carouse in, of Belshazzar; when mony for the gifts of the holy Ghost, of Simon Magus; when the price of innocent bloud, of Judas; when a share in sacriledge, of Ananias. Let us learn by Adams fall
to shut our eares against evill counsell; by Noahs shame, to abhorre drun∣kennesse; by Davids adultery, to fly idlenesse; by Josephs swearing by the life of Pharaoh, to avoid ill company; by Peters deniall, to beware of presuming on our owne strength; by Pauls buffetting, to take heed of spiri∣tuall pride. Doe the students at the law follow all Courts, and are ready at all assizes with their table-books to note what passeth in all trials, to put downe the cases, and take the sentences of the Judges: and shall we neglect the judgements of the Almighty, and not write downe in the tables of our memories such cases as are ruled in the Court of heaven? There is nothing will more deject us in the opinion of our own wisdome, and stir us up to the admiration of Gods wisedome, justice, and power, than to observe how he compasseth the wise of the world in their owne wayes, and shooteth be∣yond them in their owne bow, and over-reacheth them in their highest de∣signes: how he chuseth the foolish things of the world to convince and re∣buke the wise; the weake things of the world to conquer the mighty; the ignoble things of the world to obscure the glorious; and the things that are not to confound the things that are. When we see him draw light out of darknesse, sweet out of sower, comfort out of misery, joy out of sorrow, and life out of death, how can we distrust his goodnesse? Again, when we see on the sudden how he turneth day into night, liberty into captivity, beauty into ashes, joy into heavinesse, honour into shame, wealth into want, rule into ser∣vitude, life into death, how can we but feare his power? When we see Scepters made of mattocks, and mattocks of Scepters; hovils of Palaces, and Palaces of hovils; valleyes raised high, and hils brought low, Kings cast out of their thrones to the ground, and poore raised out of the dunghill to sit with Princes; how can we be proud? When we observe the godly man like the Oxe that goeth to plow, worn out with labour and pain, and the wicked like beasts fatted for the slaughter, abound with riotous superfluity, how can we but be patient? When we see daily stars rise and fall in the firmament of the Church, how can we then but be solicitous? Lastly, when we see our wants as well as our wealth, our defects as well as our exceedings, our falls as well as our risings, our sorrowes as well as our joyes, our fasts as well as our feasts, our sicknesse as well as our health, our terrors as well as our com∣forts, our crosses and afflictions as well as those we call blessings worke for the best for us, how can we but be content? This rule of wisedome every man by his experience can easily draw out at length, and the time calls upon me to cut the threed of this discourse: wherefore in a word I will now deli∣ver that precept of wisedome in the last place which in practice must chal∣lenge the first, viz. that in all serious and weighty affaires, especially such as concerne our spirituall estate, we aske counsell of God, who among other glo∣rious attributes, described by the Prophet Isaiah, is stiled the wonderfullEsay 9.6. His name shalbe called the wonderfull counseller. Aoc. 3.18. I counsell thee to buy of me gold, &c. Counseller, who freely gives us that counsell which cannot be got by any fee from mortall man. Successe crowneth no great attempt which wisdome undertaketh not: wisdome undertaketh nothing but by the advice of coun∣sell, and no counsell safe in deliberations of this kind but from the spirit of God. The Israelites usually asked counsell of God by the Ephod, the Greci∣ans by their Oracles, the Persians by their Magi, the Egyptians by their Hirophantae, the Indians by their Gymnosophistae, the ancient Gaules and
Brittaines by their Druides, the Romans by their Augures or Soothsayers. It was not lawfull to propose any matter of moment in the Senate,Cic. de Arusp. resp. prius∣quam de coelo servatum erat, before their wisards had made their observations from the heaven or skie. That which they did impiously and superstitiously, we may, nay we ought to doe in another sense piously, (viz.) not to imbark our selves into any action of great importance and consequence, priusquam de coelo servavimus, before we have observed from heaven, not the flight of birds, or houses of planets, or their aspects or conjunctins, such fowle or star-gazing is forbid by a voice from heaven; but the countenance of God, whether it shineth upon our enterprises or not, whether he approve of our endeavours, projects, and designes, or dislike them: if he approve of them we need not feare the successe: for if it be not good for the present, it shall be good: if he dislike them we may not hope for successe; for if the issue be not bad for the present, it shalbe bad in the end. Tullies resolution is good;Cic. ep. ad Att. sa∣pientis est nihil praestare praeter culpam, a wise man is to looke to his intentions, and to answer for his actions, that they be without blame, not to undertake for the events. Let us make good our ends, and the meanes we use, and God will make good the issue, and turne all to the best. A Pilot, as Quintilian obser∣veth, cannot be denied his lawfull plea dum clavum rectum teneam, though the ship be cast away or drowned he is not to make satisfaction, so long as he held the sterne right, and guided it by the compasse: in like maner, though our actions and good intentions miscarrie in the event, we are not to be bla∣med if we steered our course by the compasse of Gods word: though the barke be cast away, as St. Pauls was, the lives of all in it shall be safe: and our tem∣porall losses shall alway turne to our spirituall and eternall advantage. Yea, but God is in heaven, we are upon earth, how may we come to have speech with him, or open our case to him, or receive answer from him? The Jewes had two meanes to receive answer from him, either by the mouth of the Prophets, when the spirit was on them, or from the Priests, when they had put on the breast-plate of judgement: we have no such meanes now to en∣quire the will of God, neither are visions nor dreames by which men in for∣mer times understood the pleasure of God, now either frequent, or undoub∣ted oracles of truth; yet have we still meanes to advise with God both by prayer and consulting the holy Scriptures. Of the former St. James spea∣keth;Jam. 1.5. If any man lacke wisedome, that is, counsell and direction in his af∣faires, let his aske it of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shalbe given him. But let him aske in faith nothing wavering, &c. Of the second the Prophet David:Psal. 119.24. Thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellers; in the Hebrew, men of my counsell. Having now composed the presse, what remains but to clap it to the sheets, and labour by a word of exhortation to print some of these rules in your harts? Be wise now, &c. Be wise, 1. In the choice of your wisdome: 2. Be instru∣cted in the means of your instruction, make choice of the wisdome that com∣meth from above from the Father of lights, not that which commeth from beneath from the Prince of darkness: receive instruction from the spirit, not from the flesh: from God, not from the world: so shall you be wise unto sal∣vation and instructed to eternal life. Be your selves clients and sutors to God before your clients and sutors have accesse unto you; ask counsel of him be∣fore
you give counsell to them: and content not your selves with the waters of the brooke or rivelet, but have recourse to theCic. de orat. l. 2. Tard est inge∣ni rivulos con∣sectari, fontes rerum non vi∣dere. fountain. Now the foun∣taine of all law is the wisedome of God, as the wisest of the heathen Law∣givers in effect acknowledged it: Zamolxis ascribing the lawes (he delive∣red to the people) to Vesta, Zoroaster to Hormasis, Trismegistus to Mercu∣rie, Lycurgus to Apollo, Solon to Minerva, Numa to the Nymph Aegeria, Minos to Jupiter. If time be well spent in searching records of Courts, and evidences of conveyances, and titles of lands, how much better in searching the holy Scriptures which are the records of heaven, the deeds of Almighty God, and evidences of our salvation? Who would not search where he may be sure to find treasure? In Scriptures you may be sure to finde it, wherein all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge are hid: the treasures of naturall Philosophy in Genesis; of morall Philosophy in Exodus, Deuteronomie, and Ecclesiastes; of the Politickes in the Judicials of Moses, and the Pro∣verbes of Solomon; of Poetry in the Psalmes; of History in the bookes of Chronicles, Judges, and Kings; of the Mathematickes in the dimensions of the Arke and Temple; of the Metaphysickes in the bookes of the Prophets and the Apocalyps. Doe you desire that the tree of your knowledge in the Law should spread farre and neere, and that all men should shade themselves under your boughes? Water the root of the tree which beareth up your lawes, and sendeth sap and life to all the branches thereof, and that is true religion: forPsal. 111.10. the feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome: and a good understanding and care have all they that follow after it. First, to look to the maine chance, and provide for their eternall estate in another world: next, to learne certainly that they are in state of grace here: thirdly, to observe where they are weakest, and there to strengthen themselves against the assaults of the enemie: fourthly, to make use of the historie of the world, and comment upon the speciall workes of Gods providence: lastly, to entertaine God his Pro∣phets and Apostles for their learned counsell, to direct them in all their suits in the Court of heaven, and managing all their weightiest affaires on earth: so shall they be sure to attain that which David so earnestly sought of God by prayer, saying,Psal. 73.24. Guide me by thy counsell, and after that receive me to thy glory. To whom, &c.
THE JUDGES CHARGE. A Sermon preached at the Readers Feast in LINCOLNES Inne. THE NINTH SERMON. PSAL. 2.10. Be instructed, or learned, yee Judges of the earth. Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. AT the siege of Tarentum,Aelian. de Var. hist. l. 5. when the Citizens were driven by extremitie of famine to the point of yeel∣ding themselves into the hands of the Romans, they were strangely relieved by the charity of their neighbours at Rhegium, who every tenth day fasted themselves, and sent in their provision for that day to the Tarentines. In memory of which reliefe they kept ever after a feast which they cal∣led Jejunium, o Festum jejunii, the Fasts feast, or a feast grounded on a fast. Such is the Feast bid at this time in this place, gained by a long pre∣scription out of the Lent Fast. It may rightly be called Festum Jejunii, the Feast of the Fast; a Feast of the Law beside, if not contrarie to the Law of Feasts appointed by the Church. Wherein yet I conceive, according to the right meaning of the first founders of this exercise and Feast, the Eccle∣siasticall cannons of the Church, and locall statutes of these houses doe not harshly clash one against the other; but rather like strings tuned alike, and dexterously touched, make a perfect chord, and strike full unisons, both in∣tending Festum Jejunii; the one a spirituall, the other a scholasticall; the one an Evangelicall, the other a Legall Feast in the time of Fast. For the Church appointeth more frequent exercises of pietie and devotion, Prayers, Lectures, and Sermons, (which are the soules dainties) at this time, than any other season of the yeere. And agreeable hereunto in the U∣niversities, which are the Nurseries of Religion and Arts, and in these noble
Seminaries of justice, and knowledge in the lawes, the most solemne and profitable exercises for the proficiencie of students, (whether readings, disputations, or determinations) have beene, time out of minde, and are yet performed in the Lent: wherein the eye of the soule is the more apt and single for the contemplation of divine and humane knowledge, by how much it is freer from the fumes of bodily meats, and the smoake of worldly cares and businesse. As for the exceeding in some one day or other in varie∣ty of all palate provocations, it is a vaine thing for me or any other to speake against it; quia venter non habet aures, the belly hath no eares, especially to heare any thing against it selfe. If it had, I should have craved a Writ of re∣move of these Vitellian feasts out of the confines of Lent, or made a mo∣tion, that these surcharges of purse and stomacke might be turned into the LacedaemonianPhiditia were sparing meales, or frugall seasts: so named from ecl.  signifying to spare or be thrifty. Phiditia, or at least that the superaboundancie in them might not be wasted by luxurie, to the hurt of our owne bodies, but dis∣penced by charity to the reliefe of others; that devotion might recover that in almes deeds which it loseth in fasting: so would our tender and indul∣gent Mother, Christs dearest Spouse the Church, vouchsafe these mee∣tings her presence, as Mary the Mother of Jesus was present at the Feast in Cana; and Christ himselfe would furnish the wine of spirituall joy and gladnesse, even at these Feasts, though, like Saint Paul,1 Cor. 15.8. borne out of due time. But I leave the time, and have an eye to the notes pricked in my text, which are three: 1. Religion enjoyneth learning: Be learned. 2. Learning becommeth and qualifieth Judges: Ye Judges. 3. Judges give sentences of, and rules for land: The earth. 1. Divine wisedome excludeth not humane learning: Be learned. 2. Learning is not onely a comely ornament, but a necessary accoustre∣ment of a Judge: Ye Judges. 3. All Judges on earth are Judges of earth, that is, consisting of earth, or sitting upon the earth: The earth. The earth is their materia ex qua, and circa quam too. 1. The matter of which they are made. 2. The matter on which they make and give their judgement and sencence. O all ye Kings of these Netherlands, manum ad Sceptrum, oculos ad Astra: there is a King above who over-lookes you all, and will one day breake your Scepters with his Iron mace. O yee Judges of this lower Circle and Circuits, manum ad Gladium, oculos ad Astra: there is a Judge of heaven who will set his tribunall in the clouds, and call all you to his bar, and your judgements in question before him. Be wise now therefore O ye Kings, advance his Kingdome in yours: be learned ye Judges of the earth, declare his judgement by yours. Tullie giveth this character of Thacydides, that in his writings there are
neere as manyCic. declar. o∣rat. Numerum verborum nu∣mero sententia∣rum penè con∣secutus est. sentences as words: such is the Rhetorike of this parcell of holy writ, the parts are answerable to the words, the points of doctrine to the parts, the uses to the points of doctrine. 1 Erudimini, there is the charge. 2 Judices, there is the stile. 3 Terrae, there is the circuit of the Judges. 1 Be learned, there is the aime of your study. 2 Yee Judges, there is the title of your place. 3 Of the earth, there is the embleme of your frailty. These parts hold good correspondence; 1 The first with this present exercise. 2 The second with this honourable auditory. 3 The third with this holy time. 1 It is most agreeable at a Reading to treat of learning, Be ye learned. 2 It is most proper to give the Judges charge before the prime Jud∣ges of the kingdome, Ye Judges. 3 It is most seasonable to frame a discourse of the mould of us all, earth and ashes, in the time of Lent, Of the earth. By the law theLevit. 1.16. And ye shall pluck away the filth thereof with his feathers, and cast it besides the Altar, by the place of the ashes. crop, or as it is in the Hebrew, the filth of the birds that were sacrificed, together with their feathers, were to be cast in locum cinerum, into the place of ashes. Now if ever is the season not only to purge or remove the filth of our lives out of the sight of God, but also to cast away the beau∣tifull pompes, maskes, shewes, and all othes vanities of the world, which are no better than feathers in locum tinerum, where wee ought to mourne for our sinnes in sacke-cloth and ashes; pulvis & cinis, dust and ashes have great affinity with terrae in my text. Be learned. WhenCic. de orat l. 1. Neque tam molestus mibi fuit Antonius, quod jus no∣strum civile pervellit, quam jucundus quod se id nescire confessus est. Antony carped at the study of the civill law, with∣all acknowledging his small sight therein, Scaevola a great Lawyer smiling, said, that he made a kind of amends for his invective against the Law, by pro∣fessing his ignorance therein. For it is no disparagement to any science or profession to bee sleighted by such as understand it not. A bright beame and great light troubleth, and dazeleth, and paineth also a weake eye, Urit enim fulgore suo. Who can blamePeti. Diale∣ctcum crimi∣natur, sed cum ad interrogata respondere non possit. Petilian the Donatist for com∣plaining of Saint Austins Logicke, whereby that ignorant Hereticke was non-plussed and shamed? Verily as fast hath no enemy but gluttony, cha∣stity but lust, frugality but luxurie, wisedome but follie, humilitie but pride, orthodoxe doctrine but heresie, so neither knowledge but ignorance. Wherefore whatsoever faire glosse of the Scriptures selfe-sufficiency the Brownists and Separatists put upon their secret un∣dermining of our Schooles and Universities, and stopping up the Well-springs of good Learning among us, their true end is, thatEras. adag In∣ter coecos lus∣cum regnare posse. among blinde men they might bee some body, who among sharpe-sighted men are no body.
For the Latine proverbe puts them in some heart, (viz.) that a purblinde man may be a jolly fellow, nay by good reason chosen a King among such as are starke blinde. Doubtlesse, if ever learning were needfull, it is now adayes most necessary, when men by subtle Sophistry, and deceivable elo∣quence, not onely goe about to wrangle us out of our estates, but also jug∣gle us out of our Religion. Call ye it a reformation? is it not rather the de∣formation of a building to damb up the lights thereof? The state ofAelian de var. hist. l. 3. Gravis∣sima  poeam inflixerunt ut libeos suos non docerent literas. Mi∣ylene desiring to be revenged to the uttermost on their Confederates that had revolted from them, after they had got the mastery of them, laid this as the forest punishment they could devise upon them; that none of their children should goe to schoole, or be brought up in learning. And in a like regard Julians persecution was accounted more grievous than that of Dio∣clesian, though that blasphemous Apostata shed little Christian bloud; in as much as Dioclesian plucked but out the bodily eyes of Saints and Mar∣tyrs, (the holes whereof the good Emperour Constantine kissed) whereas Julian by shutting up all Christian schooles, and bereaving them of the light of knowledge, after a sort plucked out the eyes of their soules. Which I speake not for that I conceive the Scriptures are not sufficient of them∣selves for our instruction, to enlighten our understanding; but because we are not sufficient for the opening of the meaning of them, without the helps of arts and sciences, the miraculous gifts of the holy Ghost ceasing long be∣fore our time. The light of divers rapers in the same roome, though united, yet is not confounded, as the opticks demonstrate, by the distinct shadowes which they cast: neither doth the light of divine knowledge confound that of humane in the soule, but both concurre to the full illumination of the un∣derstanding. And as the organe of the bodily eye cannot discerne any thing without a double light, viz. 1.Brierhood tra∣ctat de oculo M.S. Lumine innato, an inward light in the christalline humour of the eye. 2. Lumine illato, an outward light in the aire, and on the object: so neither can the eye of the soule in this region of darknesse perfectly di∣stinguish the colours of good and evill without a double light, the in-bred light of nature, and the outward light which is acquired by learning; being Lumen not innatum, but illatum: not naturally resplendent in the soule, and brought with it into the world, but ab extrinseco, brought into the soule by reading, hearing, discoursing, contemplating, or divine inspiration.

Christ him∣selfe compareth every Scribe which is instructed unto the kingdome of hea∣ven, to a man that is an housholder, who bringeth out of his treasury new things and old. He likeneth him not to a pedler that hath nothing but inkle, tape, and such like trash in his pack, which he openeth at every mans doore; but to a rich ware-house man, who out of his treasury or ware-house bringeth out precious things, either new or old, as they are called for. Such a Scribe was Moses, whoActs 7.22. was learned in all the wisedome of the Aegyptians. Such a Scribe was Daniel and the foure children that were bred up with him, to
whom GodDan. 1.17. gave knowledge and skill in all learning. Such a Scribe was S. Paul, who wasAct. 22.3. brought up at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the Law of the Fathers. Neither was he conversant onely in the writings of the Rabbines, but also expert in the heathen Phi∣losophers, Orators and Poets, whom he after a sort defloureth of their choi∣cest sentences & observations, incorporating them into his most learned and eloquent epistles. Such a Scribe was Clemens Alexandrinus, whose writings in regard of all variety of good literature in them, are called stromata, rare pieces of Arras or Tapestry. Such a Scribe was S. Cyprian, who by Rheto∣ricke; Tertullian, who by the civill Law; Justin Martyr, and Origen, who by Philosophy; S. Basil, who by Physicke; S. Austin, who by Logicke; Eusebius, who by history; Prudentius, who by Poetry; Gregory Nazian∣zen, Jerome, and many other of the ancient Doctors of the Church, who by exquisite skill in the Arts and learned Languages, exceedingly impro∣ved their sacred talent of Scripture-knowledge.Vid. Lyps. Manuducti ad Stoicam Philosophiam. Philo that accomplished Jew deviseth an elegant allegory upon Abrahams companying with Hagar, before he could have issue by Sara. Hagar the bond-woman is secular or humane learning, with which we must have to doe, before wee can promise our selves fruit by Sarah, that is, much profit by the study of divinity. Neither doth this argue any imperfection in the Scriptures, but in us: the starres are most visible in themselves, yet through the imbecilli∣ty of our sight, without a perspective glasse we cannot exactly take their e∣levation, or true magnitude. What though God in the first plantation of the Gospell used the indu∣stry of illiterate men, and made Fishermen fishers of men, that our1 Cor. 2.5. faith should not stand in the wisedome of men, but in the power of God? yet after the miraculous gifts of the Spirit fayled in the Church, wee shall read of no Rammes hornes, but Silver Trumpets emploied in the throwing down of Sathans forts. Since that, the promise of dabitur in illa hora, it shall bee given you in that houre, is turned into the precept of attende lectioni, give1 Tim. 4.13.15 attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, meditate upon these things, give thy selfe wholly unto them, that thy profiting may appeare unto all men.

Religion commends learning, and learning a Judge:Numb. 11.17. The Lord tooke of the Spirit which was upon Moses, and put it upon seventy El∣ders. This Spirit it is which animateth a Judge, whose briefest and yet fullest definition is Jus animatum, enlived right, or the living law. For the law is a dead and mute Judge, and the Judge is a living and speaking law: As the Philosopher termethArist. Rhet. l. 3. Pictura muta poesis, poesis loquens pictu∣ra. painting silent Poetry, and Poetry a spea∣king picture. Now how can a Judge speake the law, or the law speake by him, if he know not the law? It implyeth a kinde of contradiction for an Actor to bee without action, or an Orator without words, or a Labourer without worke, or a Counsellor without advice, or a Judge without judge∣ment in the law. Can an Artificer worke by his rule, who holdeth it not in his hand? or a Pilot steere by the compasse who hath not the compasse before his eye, or understandeth it not? no more can a Judge give sen∣tence
according to the law, who is ignorant of the law. Ignorance in a pri∣vate man is a prejudice, and some blemish to himselfe, butAug. de civ. Dei. Ignorantia Judicis est ca∣lamitas inno∣centis. ignorance in a Judge is the calamity of the innocent, nay may prove the ruine of a State. What greater mischiefe in any society than that the estates, good name, livelihood, yea and lives too of men should lye in the breast of a Judge, who out of ignorance is faine to aske Quid est justitia, what is justice? as Pilate did, Quid est veritas, what is the truth? How will the Lawyers work upon this advantage? how far will the Counsell go in a bad cause, upon the strength of a large fee? what false glasses will they set before the eyes of such a Judge to deceive him, and lead him by the nose? Neither will skill in the municipall law alone suffice, and yet that law hath a large walke, and many turnings where hee may lose his way: hee must be well experienced in the affaires of the world: hee must sinke deepe into mens dispositions as well as their speeches: he must be able to weigh reasons, poyze witnesses, reconcile lawes, compare presidents: in a word, hee must be like an Angel of God to discerne betweene good and evill. Among the many titles of a good Judge, who is stiled the soule of the law, the oracle of the city, the priest of justice, the tutour of pupils, the father of orphans, the sanctu∣ary of innocents unjustly pursued, me thinks none so fitteth him as Regu∣la, or ratherArist. Rhet. l. 1. Regulator juris, a rule, or rather, the ruler of right. For or∣ders in Court you call rules, and judge cases in law, ruled cases: now that a man may rule well, that is, in your phrase judge well, sixe things are requisite. 1 That he hath skill to rule, 2 That his paper, or parchment bee spread abroad, and lye even before him, 3 That his eye be on his rule, 4 That he have nothing in his hand save his pen or plummet, 5 That his hand on his ruler be steady, 6 That his hand on his plummet be quick, to draw a line speedily. Upon these sixe ruled lines wee may write a faire copy for a Judge, ac∣cording to the forme following. 1 He must have skill to rule, knowledge to judge. 2 He must have his paper or parchment spread, that is, the case unfol∣ded before him. 3 He must fixe his eye on his rule, which is the law. 4 He must have nothing in his hand but that wherewith hee ruleth, hee must be empty-handed. 5 His hand on his ruler must be steady, it must not shake through feare. 6 His hand on his plummet or pen must be swift and ready, he must have a desire and dexterity to rid worke out of his hand, and speedi∣ly to set a period to tediously protracted suits. I had forgot one more circumstance if the last word of my text (earth) had not put me in minde of it, which is this: That a man cannot well rule,
or draw exact lines by a ruler upon his paper or parchment, but hee must needs how himselfe and looke downe up on it: neither can any man bee a good Judge who is not humble. For Lypsius truly observeth that it is a very hard thing for a manLyp polit. l. 4. Difficile est in alto positum non alta sapere. in high place not to bee high minded.Sen. de ira. l. 2. c. 21. Quic∣quid leve & in∣anc in animo est, secunda fortuna sustol∣lit, &c. Honour lifteth up the heart above measure, especially when it is armed with power. Knowledge also puffeth up, especially when it is blowne with the breath of flattery. Wherefore lest wise Kings and learned Judges should too much reflect upon the eminency of their place and gifts, and forget the frailty of their condition, the Prophet giveth them an alloy in the word immediately following the title of their dignities, Terrae, of the earth. Of the earth. When Bees are most angry in their swarming, cast but a little earth upon them, and they are presently quiet, and leave their hum∣ming. Though nothing else canPlin l. 1. c. 104. 106. Limum fla∣grantem, mal∣tham dictam, terra tantum extingui docue∣re experimen∣ta. Ignem mon∣tis Chimaerae extingui terra & fimo tradit Guidias. quench the burning slime of Samosaris, or the fire in the hill Chimaera, yet earth and dung can: so though nothing else can asswage the tumour of the proud, or quench the burning desire of honour in the ambitious, of wealth in the covetous, of pleasure in the vo∣luptuous, yet the consideration of the grave can. Hee that seriously thin∣keth with himselfe, these scarlet robes of mine clothe nothing but dung, all my dainty fare feeds but wormes; I who have power of other mens lives, have no power of my owne life, no not for a moment; even whilest I sit upon prisoners, and condemne guilty persons, I am arraigned in my consci∣ence, and plead guilty before God. Hee that keepes downe his heart with these thoughts, can no more be overthrowne with pride, than a ship which is well ballast be blowne away in a storme. Great personages, the stronger guard they have about them, the more they lye open to envie: the more secure they are by their authority, the more in danger they are of surpri∣zall by pride. Judges were Princes among the Jewes before the dayes of Saul, and Princes were Judges among the Romanes, as Augustus and A∣drian. I finde the title ofPsal. 82.1. God standeth in the congregation of the mighty, he judgeth among the Gods. & v. 6. I have said ye are Gods. Gods in Scripture attributed not onely to So∣veraigne Kings, who are the supreme Judges, but to inferiour Judges also, subordinate to Princes: theirBodin. de rep c. 4. Lex Horatia est, Jovi sacrum esse caput ejus qui Judici no∣cuerit. persons by the Roman lawes were sacred, hee who hurt them was presently to be sacrificed. In France when a Gal∣lant in his ruffe strucke a Judge, by an arrest of the Parliament at Paris his hand was suddenly cut off, and a heavie fine layd upon him. The pri∣viledges of Judges granted to them by Princes, in whose seat they sit, their power, their wealth, their clyents, their retinue, their robes, their maces, their officers, their titles will exalt them too high in their owne conceit, if they consider not with Trajan,Plin. in pane∣gyr. Se non mi∣nus hominem esse, quam ho∣minibus prae es∣se cogitet. that though they are above men, yet they are but men. Pliny the elder having related a strange story of a child, whose life was taken away by the snuffe of a candle, takes all the potentates of the earth to taske, and rings them a peale in their eare, saying,Plin. nat. hist. l. 7. c. 7. Tu qui te deum credis aliquo successu, tamen tan∣ti perire po∣tuisti, at{que} eti∣amnum potes aut minoris, ut Anacreon acino uvae, & Fabius Praeto in lactis haustu pilo. Thou which art so puffed up with the happy successe of some battell fought by thee, or some great fortune fallen unto thee, that thou takest thy selfe to bee a God, maist purchase thy death at as low a rate as this childe, or a lower, as Anacreon the Poet came to his end by a raisin stone, and Fabius the Pretor by a haire in his milke. No posture of the body seemeth more secure than sitting in a chaire, yet JudgeAug de civit. Dei, l. 22. c. 22. Quid videtur sedente securi∣us? de sella ce∣cidit Eli, & mortuus est. Ely fell out of his chaire, and brake his necke. Wherefore since Judges themselves are as subject to the lawes of humane frailty as other men, since
for ought they know they are as neere death as the prisoner whom they have newly condemned to dye: let them look above them, not about them; let them feare God, not man; let them deliver nothing at the bench, which they are not assured in their consciences that they are able to make good before the Judge of quicke and dead, from whose face heaven and earth fled away, and their place could no where be found. Judges may be considered either as of a particular circuit of the earth, and so they must receive instruction from the King or Lord of that land: or as Judges of the earth at large, and in that regard must take their Com∣mission, and receive Instruction from the Lord of the whole earth, who requireth in his Judges, 1 Religion,Exod. 18.21. thou shalt provide out of all the people, able men, such as feare God. 2 Moderation,Gal. 6.1. to restore such as are overtaken in a fault, in the Spi∣rit of meeknesse. 3 Learning and knowledge in the lawes, of which before. 4 Integrity, they mustNum. 11.24. hate covetousnesse,Exod. 18.21. & Deut. 16.19. they may not take a gift, &c. 5 Indifferency, theyDeut. 1.17. must not respect persons in judgement, but heare the small, &c. 6 Attention and diligent enquiry, theyDeut. 1.16. & 13.14. & 19.18. must heare causes, and make search, &c. 7 Expedition,Zech. 7.9. to execute true judgement, and not delay justice. 8 Resolution and courage, not toDeut. 1.17. feare the face of man. 9 Equity, toDeut. 1.16. & Joh. 7.24. judge equally and righteously betweene every man and his brother. 1 Want of Religion makes a prophane Judge. 2 Want of Moderation an unmercifull Judge. 3 Want of Learning an unsufficient Judge. 4 Want of Integrity a corrupt Judge. 5 Want of Indifferency a partiall Judge. 6 Want of Attention a rash Judge. 7 Want of Expedition a tedious Judge. 8 Want of Resolution a timorous Judge. 9 Want of Equity an unrighteous Judge. Lastly, Want of any of these an Incompetent Judge, want of all these an unsufferable and execrable Judge. 1 Religion is required in a Judge, without which there will be no con∣science of doing justice, where injustice may be borne out: and because e∣ven religious men are subject to passion, to religion a Judge must adde 2 Moderation and governement of his passions: and because a man of temper, fit for a Judge, may mistake his marke, if he be not expert in the Law, to moderation he must adde 3 Learning and knowledge in the Law, according to which he is to give sentence: and because bribes blinde theDeut. 16.19. eyes of the wisest and learnedst Judges, to learning he must adde
4 Integritie and incorruption, a sincere heart, and cleere hands: and be∣cause where bribes cannot open the hand, yet favour may enter at the eye, to his Integrity he must adde 5 Indifferencie, free from all kinde of partiality: and because a Judge, though never so religious, temperate, learned, incorrupt, and impartiall, cannot yet give right judgement without a full hearing and exact discussing of the cause before him, to indifferencie he must adde 6 Patient Attention, and diligentDeut. 19.18. inquisition: and because the plaintife or defendant are nothing benefited by the Judges hearing of, or searching into the cause, if after examination there follow not a sentence, to Attenti∣tion he must adde 7 Expedition; for delayed justice oftentimes as much wrongeth the plaintife as injustice: and because after enquiry and hearing, though the Judge be expert and readie, yet judgement may be stopped if a great per∣son appeare in the cause, to Expedition he must adde 8 Courage and Resolution: and because if a Judge strike too hard with the sword of justice he may breake it, as also because the sentence of the law may be just in generall, yet in regard of difference in circumstances may wring and wrong a man in particular, to all the former vertues a compleat Judge must adde 9Levit. 19.15. In equity shalt thou judgethy neighbour. Equity and stayed discretion, which holdeth steedily the gold weights of justice, and addeth or taketh away a graine or more to make the piece and weight perfectly agree. 1. Religion. Alvares reporteth that the Aethiopians place many chaires about the Judges seat, not out of State, but out of Religion, supposing that their Gods fit there with their Judges. That which they suppose we cer∣tainely know, that God and his Angels are present at the Assises, and that he judgeth among thePsal. 82.1.7. gods, that is, the Judges, or Princes. How reli∣gious then ought Judges to be, who are Almighty Gods Assessours? So neere is the affinity betweene Justice and Religion, that as Priests are cal∣led Judices sacrorum, Judges of Religion, and causes Ecclesiasticall; so Judges are by Ulpian stiled Sacerdotes justitiae, Priests of justice. And not on∣ly the high Priests among the Jewes, but also the Archontes of the Atheni∣ans, the Archiflamines andCic prò domo suâ ad Ponti∣fices. Cum mul∣ta divinitus Ponifices a ma∣joribus nostris in venta atque instituta sunt, tum nihil prae∣clarius quam quod vos cos∣dem, & religio∣nibus deorum immortalium, & summae reipub∣licae prae esse vo∣luerunt. Pontifices of the Romanes, the Muphteyes of the Turkes, the Brameres of the Indians, the Druides of the ancient Brit∣taines were trusted with Justice as well as Religion, and that for important considerations. For sith mortall men cannot prescribe against God, nor dis∣pence with his commandements, sith the divine law is the supreme law to which lyeth an appeale from all humane statutes and ordinances; they who by their calling are Interpreters of that law, might well be thought fit Um∣pires in all controversies concerning the equity of lawes, and conformity to the divine: especially in such points wherein the lawes trench upon holy things. But I list not in the heat of modern oppositions to drink of the waters of strife: let that question passe, whether sacred persons, expert in the divine law, are not fittest to judge in secular causes of greatest moment: this I am sure, Judges must be, if not in orders, yet eminently religious and skilfull in the law of God: for the judgement they are to give isDeut. 1.17. Gods. If a Judge be not religious, he will never be zealous for Gods honour, nor severely
punish the breaches of the first Table. If a Judge feare not God, hee will feare the face of man, and flye backe when he should stand out for a poore innocent against a mighty adversary. Martial. epig.Contra libertum Caesaris ire timens. If a Judge make no account of giving one day an account of all his acti∣ons to the supreme Judge of quicke and dead, hee will make no consscience of delaying justice, or denying it, or perverting it, or stifling it, or selling it. Justice shall be cast in her owne Court, and overthrowne upon her owne Tribunall. The JudgeCypr. l. 2. ep. 2. Inter leges delinquitur, in∣ter jura pecca∣tur, innocentia nec ubi defen∣ditu servabi∣tur. Sen. de ira l. 2. Quam turpes lites, quam tur∣piores advoca∣tos habent? Ju∣dex damnatu∣rus quae fecit, eligitur: & coro∣na pro mala causa, bona pa∣troni voce cor∣rupta. Lactan. divin. instit. l. 1. who sitteth on the bench to punish delinquents, will prove the greatest delinquent, and dye his dibaphum or bis tinctum, his twice died scarlet the third time with innocent blood. If a Judge depend upon the King, and not upon God, Seianus shall bee condemned to a most painefull and ignominious death, upon a bare letter from Tiberius, though no man know for what crime, or upon what evidence: nay a Pilate will condemne Jesus himselfe to be crucified, rather than not be thought a friend to Caesar. If a Judge be like Cardinall Caraffa, securus de numine, out of all feare of Gods vengeance, hee will make the law a snare, and justice a net, and the bench a step to his owne advancement: He will either like Hercules Priest, play with one hand for Hercules, and the other for himselfe: Or likeMazar. in Ps. 51. Ay∣at the Jew, utraque manu tanquam dextra uti, take bribes on both sides, and doe Justice on neither. 2 A Judge must be a religious man, and none but such ought to be called to the bench, yet neither are all religious men fit to be Judges; for beside the feare of God and devotion in a Judge, there must be temper in him, and sin∣gular moderation: he must be a Moses,Numb. 12.3. a very meek man above all the men that were upon the face of the earth: the mind of a Judge should be as still and calme as the upper region of the aire: Perpetuum nullâ temeratum nube serenum. For it is impossible for him clearely to discerne betweene man and man, cause and cause, blood and blood, there being colourable pretences on both sides, whose eye is clouded with passion, or overcast with any mist of preju∣dice. When the water is troubled, or mingled with mud, we see not a bright pearle or piece of silver in the bottom: in like maner when the mind is stir∣red & troubled with perturbations, we cannot discerne the truth, which for the most part lyeth not in the top, but in the bottome, as it were, of a deepe Well, according toDemoc. dixit veritatem in fundo demer∣sam. Democritus his embleme. In this consideration the A∣reopagite Judges prohibited Orators to play their Prizes of wit before them, or goe about any way by figures of amplification and exaggeration to move any affection in them, of love, or hatred, or feare, or anger, or en∣vie, or pity. AndArist. Rhet. l. 1. c. 1 . Aristotle yeeldeth a good reason for it; It is the part of an unskilfull and foolish artificer, saith he, to endevour to bow or crooke his owne rule whereby he is to work: Now the understanding of a Judge is, as it were, the rule & square by which all causes are to be tryed, and justice mett out. By indi∣rect meanes then to pervert the minde of the Judge, and deprave his judge∣ment, what is it else in an Advocate or Pleader, than to crook his owne square, and falsifie the common measure of right? Most certaine it is, that as meat ta∣steth not a like to a cleere stomacke, and to a stomacke repleat with ill hu∣mors,
so that no matter in debate presents it selfe in the like hue to a single and cleer eye, and to a dazled or blood-shot. Let S. James give the Judges their Motto, Be swift to heare, slow to speak, slow to wrath.Vellaius Pater l. 1. hist. Quic∣quid voluit valde voluit Brutus, nimium Cassius. Brutus would have made an ill judge, who was affianced to his owne will: and Cassius a worse, who was wedded to it: and Herod worst of all, of whom Josephus giveth this character, that he was Legis dominus, irae servus, Lord of the law, yet a slave to his owne passion. It is no strong piece that will easily bee out of frame: frame therefore and temper must needs be in a Judge; yet this will not serve without a great measure of 3 Knowledge and learning in lawes, 1 Divine. 2 Humane. As also in causes 1 Ecclesiasticall. 2 Secular: of which before. 1 Civill. 1 Municipall. 4 Integrity. Probè doctus est qui probus est, he is intirely learned who to his learning hath added integrity. Learning teacheth what is wrong as well as what is right, and without integrity instructeth a Judge how to make wrong passe for right in a legall forme. If a Judges eye be open to favour, or his hand to gifts, his learning will serve him to no other end, than cun∣ningly to divert the streight current, to bring water to his own Mill. He that opens his hand to catch after a great reward, cannot chuse but let fall his rule out of it. In which regard theRainold. com. in Rhet. Arist. l. 1. Thebanes pourtraying a Judge, drew a venerable personage in a sacred habite, fitting still in a chaire, having nei∣ther eyes nor hands; his sacred habit represented his religion, his venera∣ble yeeres, his learning and experience; his still sitting, his moderation; his eyes out, his indifferency or impartiality; his want of hands, his integrity or freedome from taking bribes.Mazar. com. in Psal. 51. Mazarinus complaineth of the Judges be∣yond the sea (and there let them still bee) that they resembled the blood-stone, which hath a speciall property to stanch blood, yet it is observed by Jewellers, that it never exerciseth this vertue, nor stancheth blood, unlesse it be set in, or covered over with silver, and so applyed to the veine. How true this is I know not, but sure I am that those who use a silver plummet draw blacke lines. When Demosthenes, having received a large fee of the adverse party to be silent in a cause, and being called to plead pretended the Squin∣sie, his clyent handsomely came over him, saying, , non est ista angina, sed argentangina. I could match such an Advocate with a like Judge in Poland called Ictus, who a long time stood for a poore plain∣tife against a rich defendant, in the end took of the defendant a great summe of mony, stamped according to the usuall stampe of the countrey, with the Image of a man in complete armour, and at the next Sessions in court jud∣ged the cause in favour of the defendant: and being taxed for it by his friends in private, shewing them the coyn he received, demanded of them, quis possit tot armatis resistere? who were able to stand against so many in com∣plete armour? Steele armour is bullet or musket proofe, but nothing except the feare of God is gold or silver proofe. Nothing can keepe a Judge from receiving a reward in private, in a colourable cause, but the eye of the Al∣mighty, who seeth the corrupt Judge in secret, and will reward him open∣ly, if not in his lower Courts on earth, yet in his high Court of Star-cham∣ber in heaven.
5 All corruption is not in bribes; hee who for hope of advancement or for favour, or for any by-respect whatsoever perverteth judgement, is not cleere from corruption, though his hands be cleane. The Judges who ab∣solved the beautifull strumpet Phryne, had their hands cleane, but their eyes foule. The Judges who absolved Murena, that by indirect meanes purcha∣sed the Consulship of Rome, are not taxed for taking any bribe from him, yet was their judgment corrupt, because that which swayed them in judgment was not the innocency of Murena, but his modest carriage, together with his sickness then upon him, moving them unto compassion. An upright Judge must in a morall sense be like Melchisedek, without Father or Mother, kiffe or kin; I meane in justice hee must take no notice of any affinity or consan∣guinity, friendship or favour, or any thing else, save the merits of the cause; to which 6 Hee must give a full hearing: for otherwise the Poet will tell him, thatSen. in med. Qui aliquid statuit parte in∣auditá alterá, aequum licet statuerit, baud aequus est. though the sentence he gives may be just, yet he cannot be just. The eare is not only the sense of discipline or learning, as the Philosopher spea∣keth, but of faith also, as the Apostle teacheth, yea and of truth also and ju∣stice. Though a Judge need not with Philip stop one of his eares while the accuser is speaking; yet ought he alwayes to reserve an eare for the defen∣dant, and according to the ancient decree of the Areopagites,Demost. orat. de coron. . heare both parties with like attention and indifferency their full time. Albeit our Lord and Saviour knew the hearts of men, which no earthly Judge can; yet to prescribe a rule to all Judges, hee professeth, sicut audio sic judico;Joh. 5.30. as I heare so I judge. Never any Romane Emperour was so much censured with injustice and folly asSueton. in Claud. Claudius Caesar, and the reason why hee so oft mistooke, was, because hee often sentenced causes upon the hearing of one side only, and somtimes upon the full hearing of neither. But of hearing you heare every day, not onely the Preachers at the Assizes, but the Counsell on both parts call upon you for it: I would you heard as oft of that which I am to touch in the next place (without which hearing is to no purpose:) 7 Expedition. If the time had not prevented me, I would have long insi∣sted upon the prolonging of suits in all Courts of justice. For a man can come into none of them but hee shall heare many crying with him in the Poet, Quem das finem Rex magne laborum? When shall we leave turning Ixions wheele, and rowling Sisyphus stone? O that we had an end either way! long delayed justice often more wrongeth both parties, than injustice either. I am not ignorant of the colourable pretence wherewith many excuse these de∣layes, affirming that questions in law are like the heads of Hydra, when you cut off one there arise up two in the place of it: which if it were so, as it ar∣gueth a great imperfection in our laws, which they who are best able make no more haste to supply, than beggars to heale the raw flesh; because these gaine by such defects, as they by shewing their sores: so it no way ex∣cuseth the protraction of the ordinary suits, disputes, and demurres, in which there is no more true controversie in point of law, than head in a sea-crab. 8 Of courage and resolution I shall need to adde nothing to what hath beene spoken, because the edge of your sword of justice hath a strong backe, the authority of a most religious and righteous Prince, under whom
you need not feare to doe justice, but rather not to execute justice upon the most potent delinquent. 9 There remaines nothing but Equity to crowne all your other vertues, which differeth but little from moderation above enforced; for moderati∣on is equity in the minde, as equity is moderation in the sentence. Bee not over just, saithEccl. 7.16. Solomon, but moderate thy justice with equity, and miti∣gate it with mercy, for summum jus est summa injuria; justice without mer∣cy is extreme cruelty, and mercy without justice is foolish pity; both to∣gether make Christian equity. Therfore these two vertues resemble Castor and Pollux, which if either alone appeare on the mast, is ominous, but both together promise a prosperous voyage: or like the metals, which are so termed, quia , because the veynes succeed one the other: after the veyne of one metall you fall upon the veyne of another: so in scripture you shall finde a sequence of these vertues, as in the Pro∣phet Micah,Micah 6.8. Hee hath shewed thee O man what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to doe justly, and love mercy? and in Ze∣chary,Zech. 7.9. Execute true judgement, and shew mercy and compassion every man to his brother: and in Solomon,Pro. 21.21. Hee that followeth after righteousnesse and mercy, findeth life, righteousnesse, and honour. To gather then up at length the scattered links of my discourse, to make a golden chaine for your neckes, Be instructed O ye Judges of the earth, ei∣ther Judges made of earth, earthly men, or made Judges of the earth, that is, controversies about lands, tenures, and other earthly and temporall cau∣ses, serve the Lord of heaven in feare, and rejoice unto him with trembling, bee religious in your devotion, moderate in your passions, learned in the lawes, incorrupt in your courts, impartiall in your affections, patient in hearing, expedite in proceeding, resolute in your sentence, and righteous in judgement and execution: So when the righteous Judge shall set his tribu∣nall in the clouds, and the unrighteous Judge, as being most contrary to him, shall receive the heaviest doome; ye that are righteous Judges, as be∣ing likest to him, shall receive a correspondent reward, and bee taken from sitting upon benches on earth, to be his Assessours on his throne in heaven: To whom, &c.

Hee that will blazon the armes of the Queen of affections, Eloquence, must borrow her own pencill and colours: nor may any undertake to expound this text, and declare the power of this gift here mentioned, but by the gift of this power. Wherefore as in the interpretation of other inspired Scriptures, wee are humbly to intreat the assistance of the Inspirer, so more especially in the explication and ap∣plication of this, which is not onely effectivè à spiritu, but also objectivè de spiritu, not onely indited and penned (as all other) by the spirit, but also of the spirit. This of all other is a most mysterious text, which being rightly understood, and pressed home, will not only remove the weaker fence be∣tweene us and the Greeke Church, touching the procession of the Holy
Ghost from the Sonne; but also beat downe and demolish the strong and high partition wall betweene the reformed and the Romane Church, built upon S. Peters supremacy. For if Christ therefore used the Ceremony of breathing upon his Apostles, with this forme of words, Receive yee the Holy Ghost, as it were of set purpose, visibly to represent the proceeding of the holy Spirit from himselfe, why should not the Greeke Church ac∣knowledge with us, the eternall emanation of the holy Ghost from the Sonne as well as the Father? and acknowledging it, joyne with us in the fellowship of the same spirit? Our difference and contestation with the Church of Rome in point of S. Peters primacy, is far greater I confesse. For the head of all controversies between us and them, is the controversie con∣cerning the head of the Church. Yet even this, how involved soever they make it, may be resolved by this text alone. For if Christ sent all his Apo∣stles, as his Father sent him, if he breathed indifferently upon all, if he gave his spirit, and with it full power of remittting and retaining sinnes to them all, then is there no ground here for S. Peters jurisdiction over the rest, much lesse the Popes: and if none here, none elsewhere, as the sequell will shew.

Peter as well in the mission (as my Father sent mee, so I send you) as in the Commission. Lastly, as this text containes a soveraigne Antidote against the infection of later heresies, so also against the poyson of the more ancient and farther spread impieties of Arrius and Macedonius, whereof the one denyed the di∣vinity and eternity of the Sonne, the other of the holy Ghost, both whose damnable assertions are confuted by consequence from this text. For if Christ by breathing giveth the holy Ghost, and by giving the holy Ghost power of remitting sinne, then must Christ needs bee God; for who but God can give or send a divine person? The holy Ghost also from hence is proved to be God, for who canMar. 2.7. or Esay 43.25. forgive sinnes but God alone? So much is our faith indebted to this Scripture; yet our calling is much more: for what can bee spoken more honourably of the sacred function of Bishops and Priests, than that the investiture and admittance into it, is the receiving of the holy Ghost?Primum in u∣noquo{que} gene∣re, est mensura & regula caete∣rorum. The first action in every kind of this nature, is a president to all the rest, as all the furniture of the Ceremoniall law was
made according to the first patterne in the Mount, such is this consecration in my text, the originall and patterne of all other, wherein these particulars invite your religious attention: 1 The person consecrating, Christ the chiefe Bishop of our soules. 2 The persons consecrated, The Apostles the prime Pastours of the Church. 3 The holy action it selfe, set forth 1 With a mysterious rite, he breathed on them: 2 A sanctified forme of words, receive ye the holy Ghost. 1 First, for the person consecrating. All Bishops are consecrated by him originally, to whom they are consecrated: all Priests are ordained by him to whom they are ordained Priests; the power which they are to employ for him, they receive from him, to whomMatth. 28.18. all power is given both in heaven and in earth. By vertue of which deed of gift, he makethMatth. 10.2. choice of his mi∣nisters, and hee sendeth them with authority,Jh. 20.21. as my Father sent me, so I send you: And hee furnisheth them with gifts, saying, receive yee the holy Ghost; and enableth them with a double power; of order, toMatth. 28.19. Teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost. & 1 Cor. 11.24. This do in the re∣membrance of me. preach and administer both the sacraments; and of jurisdiction also (Matth. 18.18.) Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall bee bound in hea∣ven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shallbe loosed in heaven. And that this sacred order is to continue in the Church, and this spirituall power in this order, even till Christ resigneth up his keyes and kingdome to God his Father, S. Paul assureth us (Eph. 4.10.11.12.) Hee that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things, and he gave some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pastours and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the worke of the Ministe∣ry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. Ver. 12. Till wee all come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God, unto a perfect man, un∣to the measure of the age of the fulnesse of Christ. Till all the Elect be come God ceaseth not to call by the ministery of the word, and none may call without a calling to call. Needs must there be therefore a settled order in the Church, for the calling of those to the ministery of the word & sacra∣ments, who are to call others by their ministery. This constant ordination of a succession in the Church, some make a royalty of Christ, or an appen∣dant to his princely function; for it is for Kings to set men in authority un∣der them in the affaires of the Kingdome. Others annexe it to his priest∣hood, because the high Priest was to consecrate inferiour Priests. A third sort will have it a branch of his propheticall office, because Prophets were to anoint Prophets. All these reasons are concludent, but none of them ex∣cludent. For the entire truth, in which these three opinions have an equall share is, that the establishing the ministery of the Gospell, and furnishing the Church with able Pastours, hath a dependance on all three offices: 1 On the Kingly, in respect of heavenly power. 2 On the Priestly, in respect of sacred order. 3 On the Propheticall, in respect of ministeriall gifts.
Each of Christs offices deliver into our hands as it were a key: 1. Clavem Coeli. 2. Clavem Sanctuarii, or Templi. 3. Clavem sacrae Scripturae. 1. His Kingly office conferreth on us the key of heaven, to open and shut it. 2. His Priestly, the key of the Temple, to enter into it and ad∣minister holy things. 3. His Propheticall, the key of holy Scripture, to open the meaning thereof. Thus you see ordinem ordinis, an order for holy orders; you heare who is the founder of our religious order, and whose keyes we keepe. Which consideration, as it much improveth the dignity of our calling, so it repro∣veth their indignity who walke not agreeable thereunto. A scar in the face is a greater deformity than a wound or sore in any other part of the body: such is the eminency of our calling, beloved brethren, that our spots can no more be hid than the spots in the Moone: nay, that it maketh every spot in us a staine, every blemish a scar, every pricke a wound, every drop of Inke a blot, every trip a fall, every fault a crime. If we defile Christs priesthood with an impure life, we do worse than those his professed ene∣mies who spit on his face. If we foule and black with giving and receiving the wages of unrighteousnes those hands wherwith we deliver the price of mans redemption in the blessed Sacraments, we more wrong our Saviour than those who pierced his sacred hands with nailes. If we in these holy Mounts of God, wherein we should presse the purest liquor out of the grapes of the Vines of Engaddi, vent our owne spleene and malice; what doe we else than offer to Christ againe vinegar and gall? If we Christs meniall and do∣mesticall servants turneRom. 12.11.  into , as some copies mis-read, and serve the time instead of serving the Lord. If we preach our selves, and not Christ crucified; if we beare the world in hand to wooe for our master, but indeed speake for our selves; if we use the staires of the Pulpit as steps only to our preferment; if we heare our Lord and Master highly dishonoured, and dis∣semble it; if we see the Sea of Rome continually to eat into the bankes of our Church, and never goe about to make up the breaches; if that should e∣ver fall out which a sweet sounding Cymball sometimes tinckled into the eares of the Pope, thatBernard. de considerat. ad Eu∣gen. Multi ne∣cessarii, multi adversarii, non Doctores, sed Seductores; non Praelati, sed Pi∣lati. the greatest enemies of Christ should be those of his owne house; if Pastours turne Impostours, if Doctours Seductours, if Prelates Pilates, if Ministers of Christ servants of Antichrist, either by silence to give way, or by smoothing Romish tenets to make way for Popery; no marvaile then if judgement begin at the house of God, as it did in the siege at Jerusalem with the slaughter of Ananus the high Priest: no marvaile if God suffer sacriledge to rob the Church of her maintenance almost in all places, when the Church her selfe is guilty of worse sacriledge, by robbing God of his worship and service. But on the contrarie, if as Ambassadours for Christ, we deliver our message faithfully and roundly; if we seeke not our owne, but the things that are Jesus Christs; if we esteeme not our pre∣ferments,
no nor our lives deere unto us in comparison of our Masters ho∣nour; if we preach Christ crucified in our lives, as well as in our sermons; if in our good name we are the sweet smelling favour of God, as well as in our doctrine, we may then, Christi nomine, in Christs stead challenge audience, yea, and reverence too from the greatest powers upon earth, (whatsoever State-flies buzze to the contrary.) For as he thatLuke 10.16. despiseth Christs mini∣sters despiseth him, so he thatMat. 10.40. receiveth him receiveth them also. No man who honoureth the Prince can dis-esteeme his Ambassadours. If Scribes and Pharisees must be heard because they teach in Moses chaire, how much more, Saith St. Chrysostome, may they command our attention who sit in Christs chaire? The same Apostle who chargeth every soule to beRom. 13.1.4. subject to the higher powers, who beare not the sword in vaine, as strictly requireth the faithfull toHeb. 13.17. obey them that have the rule over them in the Lord, and submit unto them: for they watch, saith he, for your soules, as they that must give ac∣count, that they may doe it with joy, and not with griefe; for that is unprofita∣ble for you. ThereforeSym. epist. ad Anast. Defer Deo in nobis, nos Deo in te. Symmachus kept within compasse, when he thus spake to Anastasius the Emperour; Acknowledge God in us, and we will ac∣knowledge him in thee. Deus est in utroque parente, we hold from Christ as you from God, as we submit ourselves to Gods sword in your hands, so you ought to obey Christs word in our mouthes. And so I passe from the person con∣secrating to the persons consecrated. He breathed on them, and said, receive ye the holy Ghost. The holy Martyr St.Cypr. de unita. Eccles. Aposto∣lis omnibus post resurrecti∣onem suam pa∣rem potesta∣tem tribuit, & dicit, sicut misit me pater & ego mitto vos, acci∣pite Spiritum sanctum: si cui remiseritis pec∣cata, remitten∣tur ei &c. Hoc eantutique caeteri Apostoli quod fuit Pe∣trus; pari con∣sortio praediti, & honoris, & pote∣statis. Cyprian makes an inference from these words, for which the Popes have looked awry upon him ever since. The inference is this; Christ after his resurrection gave all his Apostles equall power, saying, as my father sent me, so I send you, receive ye the holy Ghost: whose sinnes yee remit, they are remitted. Here lest any addicted to the Papacy might thrust upon the Martyrs words this meaning, that Christ gave all the Apostles equall authority among themselves, but not equall to Peter their head, he addeth, the rest of the Apostles were the same that Peter was, admitted into an equall fellowship both of honour and power. Marke I beseech you, the Martyr speakes here not of a priviledge or singularitie, but a society, (consortio;) not a superiority, but a parity, (pari;) and this parity both in honour, (ho∣noris;) and of power also, (potestatis:) where there is a parity in honour there can be no preheminencie; where there is a parity in power there can be no supremacy. Where then will our Adversaries fasten? Upon those words of Christ,Mat. 16.18. Thou art Peter, and upon this rocke will I build my Church? St. Austin beats them off this hold, expounding the rocke of Christ, not of Peter, thus, Upon me IAugust. in haec verba, Super me aedificabo te, non super te ae∣dificabo me. will build thee, not me upon thee. Yet if we should leave it them, the building upon Peter, or laying him in the foundation of the Church, will no more make him the supreme head of the Church than the rest of the Apostles; for we read ofApoc. 21.14. And the wall of the Citie had 12. foundations, and in them the names of the 12. Apostles of the Lambe. & twelve foundations up∣on which the heavenly Jerusalem is built, on which the names of the twelve Apostles were engraven, and of more also: now therefore, saith he, ye are no more strangers and forreiners, but fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the houshold of God; and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles andEhes. 2.0. Of more. Prophets. From whence SaintJer adver. Lu∣cifer. Super om∣nes ex aequo Ecclesiae forti∣tudo solidatur. Jerome inferreth, that the strength of the Church is solidly founded, and equally built upon all the Apostles.
Will they fasten upon the promise made to Peter, (Mat. 16.19.) what∣soever thou shalt binde on earth shall be bound in heaven: these words might carry some shew of a priviledge granted to S. Peter, if S. Matthew, and the other Apostles were not joyned in Patent with him;Mat. 18.18. whatsoever yee shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, andJoh. 20.23. whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them. The last refuge to which our adversaries flye, is that text,Joh. 21.15. Feede my lambs, feede my sheep. Which charge of our Saviours makes nothing for Peters supremacy, Peter himselfe being Interpreter; for what Christ gives him he gives all Elders in charge,Pet. 5.2. Feed the flocke of God which is among you. If feede my sheepe make Peter an oecumenicall Pastor, then feede the flocke of Christ, spoken in like manner to all Elders makes them oecumenicall Pastors. If the word (pasce) when it is spoken to Peter signi∣fies rule as a Monarch, then (pascite) feede yee, spoken by S. Peter to El∣ders must likewise bee interpreted, rule yee over the Flocke of God, and Church of Christ as Monarchs. For asCic. orat. pro Cecinna. Nun∣quam obtine∣bis ubi tu volu∣eris verba inter∣dicti valere o∣portere, ubi tu nolueris non o∣portere. Tully spake to Ebutius, so may I say to Bellarmine, you shall never perswade any man of understanding that words must signifie what you will have them, and conclude nothing but what you will inferre from them; that the word pasce or feede, when it serveth your purpose must be taken for to beare rule over the whole Church; and when it serveth not, then it must signifie nothing but teach, as every Pastor doth. Had the Apostles so understood the words of our Saviour to Saint Pe∣ter, Upon this rocke will I build my house, and, To thee I will give the keyes of the Kingdome of heaven, as the Church of Rome at this day doth, (viz.) I will appoint thee Head of all the Apostles, and visible Monarch of the Church, and infallible Judge of all controversies; they would never have contended, as they did afterwards,Luk. 20.24. which of them should bee counted greatest; they would never have taken upon them to send himAct. 8.14. Now when the Apostles which were at Je∣rusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John. with John. It is not the manner of Subjects to send their Soveraignes in Embassages or messages, much lesse joyne any other of their Subjects in equall commissi∣on with them, as the Apostles doe John with Peter. Had the Church in the Apostles time understood that our Saviour by that charge, Pasce oves meas, Feed my sheep, made Peter universall Pastor of the whole world; and by his prayer for him, that his Faith might not faile priviledged him from all possibility of errour; they would have rested upon his resolution in the firstAct. 15.11. Synode. Saint James would never have presumed to speake after him in the great point which was then in controversie; nor have added a distinct Head or Canon of his owne, That the Gentiles should abstaine from polluti∣on of Idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from bloud. The Apostolicall letter should have beene indorsed, not as it was, The A∣postles, and Elders, and Brethren, but, Peter, Christs Vicar, and Monarch of the Church, and the Apostles his Counsellours; or after the like manner. Had Saint Paul beleeved Saint Peter to be Head of the Church, he would never haveGal. 2.11. withstood him to the face, as hee did at Antioch, much lesse have stood upon even tearmes with him as he doth, saying,2 Cor. 12.11. In nothing am I behinde the very chiefest Apostles: and,Gal. 2.6. they who seemed to be pillars added nothing to mee: and ver. 7. the Gospell of the uncircumcision was committed to mee, as the Gospell of the circumcision was to Peter. If any mans eyes are so dazeled with the lustre of the Popes triple Crowne, that hee cannot see
Pauls equality to Peter in the letter of the text; yet hee cannot but see it in the Fathers Commentaries.Ambros. in comment. 2 Cor. 12. Hoc dicit quia non est minor ne{que} in praedicatione, ne{que} in signis faciendis, nec dignitate, sed tempore. Chry. in 2 Cor. 12.11. . The Apostle speaketh on this wise, saith Saint Ambrose, that or because, he is not inferiour to the chiefe Apostles, neither in preaching, nor in working miracles, nor in dignity, but in time. Saint Chry∣sostome acutely observeth, that the Apostle redoubleth his forces, and not content with that hee had said before in 2 Cor. 11.5. I suppose I was not a whit behinde the very chiefest Apostles; he addeth in the Chapter following with more confidence and authority, In nothing am I behinde the very chiefest Apostles, though I be nothing. What? not inferiour to Saint Pe∣ter? no not Saint Peter (for so it followeth in Saint Chrysostome) he sheweth himselfe to be equall in dignity to the rest; and heChrys. in Gal. 2. v. 8. . compareth himselfe not to other of the Apostles but to the chiefe, shewing that he was of equall ranke with him. See, saithOccumen. in Gal. 2. . Oecumenius, how he equalizeth himselfe to Peter, or sets himselfe upon even ground with him. These were Fathers of the Greeke Church: what will our adversaries say ifLeo serm. de laud. Petri & Pauli. De quo∣rum meritis & virtutibus quae omnem superāt dicendi facul∣tatem, nihil di∣versum sentire debemus, nihil discretum, quos & electio pa∣res, & labor si∣miles, & mors fecit aequales. Leo Bishop of Rome, who ex∣tolled Peter above the skies, and admitteth him after a sort into the fellow∣ship of the individuall Trinity, yet maketh Saint Paul his match, saying, Let no man cast a golden apple of contention betweene these glorious instru∣ments of Christs Gospell Peter and Paul, of whose merits and vertues, which exceed all faculties of speech, or can never bee sufficiently commended, wee ought to thinke nothing divers, or put no difference at all in any respect be∣tweene them; whose calling to the Apostleship made them equall, and their travell in their office like, and their martyrdome parallel? Saint Paul then in Leo his judgement may goe everywhere hand in hand with Peter; and in very deed hee hath the hand of him in the Popes seale, which putteth Bellarmine to much trouble, and great feare, lest Saint Paul should bee ta∣ken to bee the better man of the two, because in the Popes seale, which confirmeth all his Buls, and unerring Decrees ex cathedra, Saint Paul hath the right hand, and Saint Peter the left. But hee may set his heart at rest, for no Protestant goeth about to set Saint Peter below Saint Paul, or any other Apostle: all that wee contend for among the Apostles is but for a parity: a parity there may bee in the Apostolicall power and function, and yet Peter have some preheminency in respect of his yeeres or gifts; such a primacy may be granted him without any power or jurisdiction over the rest: some power hee might have over the rest, and bee a kinde of Presi∣dent in the Apostles Colledge, yet not Christs Vicar generall, or Head of the whole Church: Head hee might bee of the Church in some sense, yet his Headship, as his Apostleship, dye with him, and not descend upon his successors: descend it might upon his successors, to wit, upon his undoub∣ted successors in Antiochia, & not be appropriated to his questionable suc∣cessors at Rome: lastly, it might be after a sort entayled to his successors at Rome, yet with a qualification, to all his lawfull successors, not to usurpers: to men, as Linus; not to women, as Pope Joane; to Catholickes, as Saint Gregory and Damasus, and all the Popes for 300. yeeres; not Heretickes, as Liberius and Honorius, and many of the latter: to such as entred canoni∣cally, as Cornelius and Stephanus, and the ancient Popes generally; not such as thrust themselves into that See, and purchased the Papacy either by art Magicke, as Sylvester the second; or by an imposture as Hildebrand; or si∣mony
and faction, as almost all since. Lastly, upon Apostolicall men in life and doctrine, not apostaticall or apotacticall, as those fifty Popes rec∣koned by Genebrard (his Holinesses Chronicler) one after another. By all which particulars seriously considered, Urban his supremacy derived from Saint Peter, appeareth to be a rope of sand, or a castle of Table-men piled one upon another without any thing to hold them together, which fall allasunder with a fillep; or an old ruinous paire of staires, the ground∣cell or foot whereof, viz. Peters superiority to the rest of the Apostles, is not sure, and all the consequences deduced from thence, like staires built upon it, are all rotten: and therefore I will stand no longer upon them, but leape into my third and last part, The manner of the Apostles consecrati∣on: and first of the mysterious rite, Hee breathed. The truth and substance Christ himselfe, who put an end to all legall shadowes, commanding all to worship God in Spirit and truth, ordained notwithstanding mysterious rites in the Sacraments of the new Testament, and used visible and significant gestures in his miraculous cures: he gave sight to the blinde, not without touching the eye; and hearing to the deafe, not without thrusting his finger into the eare; and speech to the dumb, not without wetting the tongue: he fetched not Lazarus breath back againe, without fetching a deepe sigh; nor inspired his Disciples with the holy Ghost, without breathing upon them. GesturesCic. de orat. l. 3. Gestus est ser∣mo quidam corporis. in religious actions are as significant, and more moving than words. Decent Ceremonies in the substantiall worship of God are like shadowing in a picture, which if it bee too much (as we see in the Church of Rome) it darkeneth the picture, and obscureth the face of devotion; but if convenient, and in fit places, it giveth grace and beauty to it. Superstition may be, and is as properly in such, who put Religion in not using, as in those who put Religion in using things in their owne nature meerely indifferent. Christian liberty is in∣differently abridged by both these errours about things indifferent. And as a man may be proud even of the hatred of pride, and contempt of great∣nesse; so he may be superstitious in a causlesse feare, and heady declining of that which seemes, but is not superstitious. Which is the case of some refined Reformers (as they would bee thought) who according to their name of Precisians, ungues ad vivum resecant, pare the nailes of pretended Romish rites in our Church so neere, that they make her fingers bleede. For feare of monuments of Idolatry, all ornaments of the Church (if they might have their will) should be taken away: for feare of praying for the dead, they will not allow any prayer to be said for the living at the buriall of the dead: for feare of bread-worship, they will not kneele at the Com∣munion: for feare of invocating the Saints deceased, they will not brooke any speech of the deceased in a funerall Sermon: for feare of making matri∣mony a Sacrament, they will have it no sacred rite, but a meere civill joy∣ning the parties contracted in the congregation, not by the hand of the Mi∣nisters of God, but by the hand of their laye Elders or Borgomasters: for feare of overlaying the Queenes vesture with rich laces of ceremonies, they rip them off all, cut off the fringe, and pare off the nappe also. But because the Spouse of Christ (as things now stand) is more afraid of losing her coat than of her lace or fringe, I leave these men, as unworthy upon whom
more breath should be spent; and come to the particular rite or ceremony of breathing used by our Saviour. Hee breathed on them. Here every Interpreter aboundeth in his owne sense:Barrad. in E∣vang. Flatus domini pote∣statem quam dabat remit∣tendi peccata adumbrabat; ut enim flatu nu∣bes too aere pelluntur, sic flatu domini, id est, Spiritu san∣cto peccatorum nubes disper∣guntur; juxta illud Esa. 44. de∣levisti ut nubes iniquitates no¦stras. Barradius his sense is, that this breathing shadowed forth the ghost∣ly power of remitting of sinnes, which Christ gave to his Apostles. For as by a blast of wind clouds are driven out of the aire; so by the blast of God, that is the holy Spirit, the clouds of our sinnes are dispersed; according to the words of the Prophet Esay, cap. 44.22. I have blotted out as a thicke cloud thy transgressions.Maldonat. in Johan. Christus per insufflatio∣nem declarare voluitipsam Spiritus sancti naturam, est e∣nim veluti fla∣tus patris & fi∣lii. Maldonate his sense is, that Christ by this visible ceremony of breathing declared the nature of the holy Ghost, who is the breath of the Father and the Sunne.Musculus in Johan. Commo∣dè Spiritum per flatum dedit, cum illis mune∣ris Apostolici potestatem da∣ret, pendebat enim illa a ver∣bis oris ipsius. Musculus his sense is, that Christ fitly used the ceremony of breathing, when he invested the Apostles into their function, because it hath a dependance upon the words of his mouth; be∣cause it is a power of the word, it was therefore given by breathing on them.Calvin. harm. Cumarcana in∣spiratione pos∣set Christus gratiam con∣ferre Aposto∣lis, visibilem flatum addere voluit ad eos melins confir∣mandos: sym∣bolum autem sumpsit à vul∣gari S.S. more qui Spiritum confert vento. Calvin his sense is, that Christ added this ceremony of outward breathing upon them, to confirme their faith in the inward inspiration: the symbole or signe hee tooke from the common custome of the Scripture, which compareth the spirit to winde.Athana. in Joh. In sufflan∣do dedit ani∣mam quae est principium vi∣tae naturalis, & Spiritum qui est principium vi∣tae spiritualis, ut idem quicre∣ator agnoscere∣tur renovator. Athanasius his sense is, that as God in the creation of man breathed into him his soule, which is the be∣ginning or principle of the naturall life; so Christ here breathed into the Disciples his spirit, which is the beginning or principle of the spirituall life; that wee might know that the same God who is the author of the na∣turall life, is also the author of the life of grace; and that hee who first cre∣ated the spirit of man, reneweth all the faithfull in the spirit of their mindes. But the most naturall, genuine, and generally approved reason and inter∣pretation of this rite and ceremony is that which is given by Saint Au∣stine and Saint Cyrill (viz.) that Christ by breathing on his Apostles, when he gave them the holy Ghost, signified that the person of the holy Ghost proceeded from him, as that breath came out of his mouth. For although Theophylact infected with the present errour of the Greek Church, jeareth at this interpretation, yet neither doth hee, nor can hee give so apt and fit a one: and in this regard Cardinall Bellarmine justly taketh him up for sleighting the judgement of two of the greatest pillars of the Church. Ve∣rely, saith he, Theophylact is to be jeared at by all of the Latine Church, if hee flout at Saint Austine: and of the Greeke Church also if hee flout at Saint Cyril: for what interpretation so naturall, what reason so proper can be given of coupling this ceremony with the words, Receive yee the Holy Ghost? that is giving the holy Ghost by breathing, as this, that the holy Spirit proceedeth from his person. And so I passe from the mysterious rite of breathing, to the sanctified forme of words. Receive yee the holy Ghost. Not the person nor the substance of the holy Ghost; for that errour the Master of the sentences was long agoe whipt by his schollars. Sanctified the Apostles were by receiving the Spirit, but not deified. What then received they at this time? some gift of the holy Ghost? that takes not away the doubt but makes it; untieth not the knot but fasteneth it rather. For as Pythagoras, when the question of marriage was put to him in his flourishing age, answered,  not yet; when in his decaying and withering age, hee replyed,  not now: so if the question
be of the ordinary gifts of the holy Ghost, it may be said, , the Apo∣stles were not now to receive them, because at their first calling they were seasoned with that heavenly liquor. But if the question be of the extraor∣dinary gifts of the holy Ghost, or a fuller measure of the ordinary, it may be replied, , they were not as yet to receive them. For ChristJoh. 16.7. must first ascend before he send the holy Ghost. To take this pearle out of the eye of my text, many medicines have beene applyed. Theodoret thus offereth to remove it, Our Saviour (Joh. 16.7.) said not that hee would not give the holy Ghost before his ascension, but that he would not send him before; at this time (saith that Father) Christ gave the holy Ghost secretly, with grace; but then he sent him in a visible shape with power.Calvin in Joh. Sic datus fuit Apostolis spiri∣tus hoc loco, ut respersi fuerint duntaxat ejus gratia, non ple∣na virtute im∣buti. Calvin helpeth it with a di∣stinction of the receiving the holy Ghost in different degrees; now the Spi∣rit was but sprinkled, as it were, upon them; but in the day of Pentecost it was powred out on them: now they were gently breathed on, and refreshed as it were with a small gale; then they were all blowne upon, as it were with a mighty winde.Chrys. in Joh. . Saint Chrysostome thus expedites the difficulty; some say that Christ gave not the holy Ghost at this time, but that by his breathing on his Apostles, he made them capable, or fit to receive him; but wee may safely goe farther, and say, that the Apostles at this time received some spirituall grace or power, not of working wonders, but of remitting sinne. If you fur∣ther aske, why the power of forgiving sinnes; or, which comes all to one, why remission of sinnes is peculiarly attributed to the Spirit, and by a me∣tonymie termed the Holy Ghost: Barradius bringeth us an answer out of the schooles, thatBarrad. in harmon. Evang. remission of sinnes is a worke of Gods goodnesse and mercy; now workes of goodnesse are peculiarly attributed to the holy Spirit, who pro∣ceedeth (as they determine) from the will of the Father and the Sonne, whose object is goodnesse; as workes of wisedome are attributed to the Sonne, be∣cause hee is the word, proceeding by way of generation from the understan∣ding of his Father. This reason may goe for currant in their way; neither have I any purpose at this time to crosse it, but to haste to the period of this discourse: in which that I may better discover the path of truth, in stead of many little lights which others have brought, I will set up one great taper made of the sweetest of their waxe. The Holy Ghost is sometimes taken for the person of the Comforter, which sealeth Gods chosen to salvation: sometimes for the gifts, effects, or operations of the Holy Ghost, as it were, the prints of his scale left in the soule: these are principally three; 1 , Grace. 2 , spirituall power or authority. 3 , Vertue, or ghostly ability to worke wonders, and speake with divers languages. 1 Is common to all them that are sanctified. 2 Is peculiar to Christs Ministers. 3 Restrayned to the Apostles themselves, and some few others of their immediate successors.
Joh. 3.5. Excet a man be borne of the water and of the spirit—1 Regenerating grace is termed the holyGhost. 2 Spirituall order, or ministeriall power is called the Spirit or holy Ghost in this place, and Luk. 4.18. & Esay 61.1. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the Gospell, &c. 3 Miraculous vertue is called the holy Ghost, Act. 2.4. And they were filled with the holy Ghost, and spake with divers tongues. 1 The Spirit of grace and regeneration the Apostles received at their first calling. 2 The Spirit of ecclesiasticall government they received at this time, &c. 3 The Spirit of powerfull and extraordinary operation they re∣ceived in the day of Pentecost. 1 In their mindes by infallible inspiration. 2 In their tongues by multiplicity of languages. 3 In their hands by miraculous cures. Receive then the Holy Ghost, is 1 A ghostly function to ordaine Pastors, and sanctifie congrega∣tions to God. 2 Spirituall gifts to execute and discharge that function. 3 Spirituall power or jurisdiction to countenance and support both your function and gifts. Thus have I opened the treasury of this Scripture, out of which I now offer to your religious thoughts and affections these ensuing observations. And first in generall I commend to the fervour of your zeale and devotion, the excessive heat of Christs love, which absumed and spent him all for us, flesh and spirit. His flesh he offereth us in the Sacrament of his Supper: his spirit hee conferreth in the sacred rite of consecration. His body hee gave by those words, Take, eate, this is my body: his spirit hee gave by these, Receive ye the holy Ghost; a gift unestimable, a treasure unvaluable: for it was this spirit which quickned us when wee were dead in trespasses and sinnes, it is this spirit which fetcheth us againe when wee swoune in de∣spaire, it is this spirit that refresheth and cooleth us in the extreme heat of all persecutions, afflictions, sorrowes, and diseases; to it we owe, 1 Light in our mindes. 2 Warmth in our desires. 3 Temper in our affections. 4 Grace in our wils. 5 Peace in our consciences. 6 Joy in our hearts, and unspeakeable comfort in life and death. This is the winde which blowethCant. 4.16. Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out: let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits. upon the Spouse her garden, that the spices thereof might flow out. This is the breath which formeth the words in the cloven tongues: this is the breath which bloweth and openeth all the
flowers of Paradise. This is the blast which diffuseth the savour of life through the whole Church. This is the gale which carryeth us through all the troublesome waves of this world, and bringeth us safe to the haven where we would be. And as the Spouse of Christ, which is his mysticall body, is infinitely indebted to her head for this gift of the spirit, whereby holy congregati∣ons are furnished with Pastors, and they with gifts, and the ministery of the Gospell continually propagated; so wee above all nations in the world at this day are most bound to extoll and magnifie his goodnesse towards us herein: among whom in a manner alone, this holy seed of the Church remaineth unmixed and uncorrupt; not onely as propagated but propaga∣ting also, not children onely but Fathers. Apostolicall doctrine other re∣formed Churches maintaine; but doe they retaine also Apostolicall disci∣pline? laying of hands they have on Ministers and Pastors, but consecration of Archbishops and Bishops they have not. And because they want con∣secrated Bishops to ordaine Pastors, their very ordination is not according to ancient order. Because they want spirituall Fathers in Christ to beget children in their ministery, their Ministers by the adversary are accounted no better than filii populi; whereas will they nill they, even in regard of our Hierarchy, the most frontlesse Papists must confesse the children be∣got by our reverend Fathers in the ministery of the Gospell, to be as legi∣timate as their owne. For albeit they put the hereticke upon us, as the Arrians did upon the Catholike Fathers, calling them Athanasians, &c. yet this no way disableth either the consecration of our Bishops, nor the ordination of our Priests; not onely because we have proved the dogge ly∣eth at their doores, and that they are a kinde of mungrils of divers sorts of heretickes: but because it is the doctrine of their Church,See Croy in his third conformity. Whitaker in fine resp. ad demon∣strat. Sanderi. Ri∣vet, procem. de haeref. q. 1. Cath. orthod. that the cha∣racter of order is indeleble; and therefore Archbishop Cranmer, and o∣ther of our Bishops ordained by them, if they had afterwards (as Papists most falsly suppose) fallen into heresie, could not lose their faculty of consecration and ordination. The consecration of Catholicke Bishops by Arrians, and baptisme of faithfull Christians children by Donatists, though heretickes, is made good, as well by the decrees of ancient as later Councels, determining that Sacraments administred even by heretickes, (so they observe the rite, and forme of words prescribed in holy scrip∣ture) bee of force and validity. Praysed therefore for ever bee the good will of him that dwelt in the bush, that the Rod of Aaron still flourisheth a∣mong us, and planteth and propagateth it selfe, like that Indian fig-tree so much admired by all Travellers, from the utmost branch whereof issueth a gummy juyce, which hangeth downe like a cord or finew, and within a few months reacheth the ground, which it no sooner toucheth than it ta∣keth root and maketh it selfe a tree, and that likewise another, and that like∣wise a third, and so forward till they over-runne the whole grove. To draw nearer to you my Lord to bee consecrated, and so to an end. This scripture is part of the Gospell appointed for the Sunday after Easter, knowne to the Latine Church by the name of Dominica in albis. Which Lords day, though in the slower motion of time in our Calendar, is not yet come; yet according to exact computation, this Sunday is Dominica in al∣bis;
and if you either respect the reverend presence Candidantium, or Can∣didandi, or the sacred order of Investiture now to be performed, let your eyes be judges whether it may not truely be termed Dominica in albis, a Sunday in whites. The text it selfe, as before in the retexture thereof I shewed, is the prototypon or original of all consecrations, properly so called. For howsoever these words may bee used, and are also in the ordination of Priests, because they also receive the holy Ghost, that is, spirituall power and authority; yet they receive it not so amply and fully, nor without some li∣mitation, sith ordination and excommunication have bin ever appropriated and reserved to Bishops. And it is to be noted, that the Apostles long before this were sent by Christ to preach and baptize; and therefore they were not now ordained Priests, but consecrated Bishops, as SaintGreg. in Evan. Horum nunc in ecclesiâ Episco∣pi locum tenent qui gradum re∣giminis sorti∣untur, grandis honor sed gra∣ve pondus est istius honoris. Gregory saith expressely in his illustration of these words, Receive the holy Ghost: whose sinnes yee remit, &c. Now Bishops who fit at the sterne of the Church, hold the place of those to whom Christ gave here the ghostly power of forgiving sinnes: a great honour indeed, but a great charge with∣all, and a heavie burden; so ponderous in Saint Barnards judgement, that it needs the shoulders of an Angell to beare it. The Apostles had made good proofe of their faithfulnesse in the ministry of the Word and Sacra∣ments, before Christ lifted them up to this higher staire; as likewise the venerable Personage now to bee taken up into that ranke hath done. For more than thirty yeeres hee hath shined as a starre in the firmament of our Church, and now by the primus motor in our heaven, is designed to bee an Angell (or to speake in the phrase of the Peripatetickes) an Intelligence to guide the motion of one of our Spheres. Which though it be one of the least, his Episcopall dignity is no whit diminished thereby. In SaintHiero. ad Evag Omnis Episco∣pus sive Ro∣mae, sive Eugu∣bii aequalis est meriti. Hieromes account every Bishop, be his Diocesse great or small, is equally a Bishop; Episcopatus non suscipit magis & minus, one Bishop may be richer than a∣nother, or learneder, but hee cannot bee more a Bishop. Therefore how∣soeverBasil. epist. 31. . Nazianzen tooke it unkindly at Saint Basils hands, after hee was advanced to the Metropolitical See of Cappadocia, and had many good Bi∣shopricks in his gift, that he put him upon one of the meanest, being ill si∣tuated, and of small revenue; telling him flatly, that he gained nothing by his friendship but this lesson, not to trust a friend: yet it never troubled great Austine that obscure Aurelius worked himselfe into the great and famous Archbishopricke of Carthage, whilest this eminent light of the Church stucke all his life at poore Hippo: for hee well remembred the words of our Lord and Master,Matth. 25.21. Be thou faithfull in a little, and I will set thee over much. Suffer I beseech you a word of exhortation, and but a word. Be faith∣full to your Master, seeke not your owne but the things that are Jesus Christs. It is not sufficient in Nazianzens judgement for a Bishop, not to be soyled with the dust of covetousnesse, or any other vice;Nazian. orat. 1 de fuga in pont. Privati quidem hominis vitium esse existimet turpia suppli∣cioque digna perpetrare, praefecti autem vel antistitis non quam op∣timum esse. he must shine in vertue, and if hee bee not much better than other men,Idem orat. 20. Antistes impro∣bitatis notam ef∣fugere non po∣test, nisi mul∣tum antecellat. hee is no good Bishop. Wherefore as it was said at the creation of the Romane Consul, praesta nomen tuum, thou art made Consul, make good thy name, consule reipublicae: So give mee leave in this day of your consecration to use a like forme of words, to you my Lord Elect; Episcopus es, praesta nomen
tuum, you are now to be made a Bishop, an Overseer of the Lords flocke, make good your name, looke over your whole Diocesse, observe not onely the sheepe but the Pastors, not only those that are lyable to your authority & jurisdiction, but those also who execute it under you. Have an eye to your eyes, and hold a strict hand over your hands, I meane your officials, colle∣ctors, and receivers; and if your eye cause you to offend, plucke it out, and if your hand, cut it off. Let it never bee said by any of your Diocesse, that they are the better in health for your not visiting them; as theEras. apoth. Eò melius ha∣beo quod te medico non utor. Lacedemonian Pausanias answered an unskilfull Physician that asked him how hee did, the better (quoth he) because I take none of your Physick. Imprint these words alwayes in your heart, which give you your indeleble character: consi∣der whose spirit you receive by imposition of hands, and the Lord give you right understanding in all things: it is the spirit of Jesus Christ, he breathed, and said, receive the holy Spirit. This spirit of Jesus Christ is, 1 The spirit of zeale. Joh. 2.17. Bee you not cold in Gods cause, whip out buyers and sellers out of the Church. 2 The spirit of discretion. Joh. 10.14. I am the good shepheard, and know my sheepe, and am knowne of them. Know them well whom you trust with the mysteries of salvation, to whom you commit those soules which God hath purchased with his owne blood; lay not hands rashly upon any, for if theMatth. 6.23. light be darkenesse how great will the darkenesse be? If in giving holy orders, and imposition of hands there be a confusion (hand over head) how great will the confusion be in the Church? 3 The spirit of meeknesse. Matth. 11.29. Learne of me that I am meek, breake not a bruised reede, nor quench the smoaking flaxe; sis bonus O foe∣lixque tuis, be good especially to those of your own calling. Take notHistor. Aug. in Aureliano. Au∣relian for your patterne, whose souldiers more feared him than the enemy: but ratherSuet. in Tit. Titus Vespasian, who suffered no man by his good will to goe sad from him, and in this regard was stiled, Amor & delicrae humani gene∣ris, the love and darling of mankinde. The laity shew in their name what they are durum genus; and how ill they stand affected to us, stone. and hardly en∣treat our tribe, all have experience who have or ever had pastorall char∣ges. Wee cannot pray them so fast into heaven, as they will sweare us out of our maintenance on earth. And what reliefe wee have at secular tribu∣nals the world seeth; and if wee must yet expect harder measure from your officers and servants, I know not to what more fitly to compare the infe∣riour of our Clergy, who spend themselves upon their parochiall cures, and are flieced by them whom they feed, and by whom they should bee fedde, through vexatious suits in law, than to the poore hare in the Epi∣gram, which to save her selfe from the hounds, leaped into the sea, and was devoured by a sea-dogge: Auson epig.In me omnis terrae pelagi{que} ruina est. 4 The spirit of humility. Matth. 20.28. The Sonne of man came not to bee ministred unto but to minister. The head of the Church vouchsafethJoh. 13.14. to wash his disciples feet, professing therein (ver. 15.) that hee gave them an example, that they should doe as hee had done to them. Winde blowne
into a bladder filleth it, and into flesh, maketh it swell; but the breath of God inspired into the soule produceth the contrary effect: it abateth and taketh downe all swelling of pride. Take not Austine the Monke for your patterne, from whose proud behaviour towards them, the Brittish Monkes truely concluded, that hee was not sent unto them from Christ; but Saint Austine the Father, whose modest speech in a contention betweene him and Jerome, gained him more respect from all men, than ever the Bishops of Rome got by their swelling buls, and direfull fulminations. According to the present custome of the Church (saith he) the title of aAugust. epist. ad Hieron. Bishop is above that of a Priest, yet Priest Jerome is a better man than Bishop Austine. As theBruson facet. & exempl. Athenians wisely answered Pompey, requiring from them divine honour; We will so farre account thee a God, as thou acknowledgest thy selfe a man (for humility of minde in eminency of fortune is a divine perfe∣ction): so the lesse you account your selfe a Prelate, the more all men will preferre and most highly honour you. When Christ consecrated his Apo∣stles Bishops, he breathed on them, to represent after a sort visibly by an outward symbole, the eternall and invisible procession of the holy Ghost from his person. In regard of which divine signification of that his insuffla∣tion, no man may presume to imitate that rite, though they may, and do use the words, Receive the holy Ghost. All that may bee done to supply the defect of that ceremony is in stead of breathing upon you, to breath out prayers to almighty God for you, that you right reverend Fathers may give; and for you my Lord Elect, that you may receive the holy Ghost; for us that wee may worthily administer; and for you that you may worthily participate the blessed body and blood of our Saviour; and for us all, that wee may bee nourished by his flesh, and quickened by his spirit, and live in him, and hee in us; and dwell in him, and he in us: So be it, &c.
THE FAITHFULL SHEPHEARD. A Sermon preached at the Consecration of three Bishops, the Lords Elect of Oxford, Bristoll, and Che∣ster, in his Graces Chappell at Lambeth, May 9. 1619. THE ELEVENTH SERMON. 1 PET. 5.2.3.4. Feede the flocke of God which is among you, taking the over-sight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly: not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind: not as being Lords over Gods heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. And when the chiefe shepheard shall appeare, you shall receive a crowne of glory that fadeth not away. Most Reverend, Right Honourable, Right Reverend, right Worshipfull, &c. ARchilochusArist. Rhet. c. 2. sharpning his quill, and dipping it in gall a∣gainst Lycambes; that his satyricall invectives might bee more poignant, putteth the pen in Archilochus his Fathers hand, and by an elegant prosopopeia maketh him upbraid his sonne with those errors and vices, which it was not fit that any but his father should in such sort rip up. AndOrat. pro M. Coelio. Tully being to read a lecture of gravity and modesty to Clodia, which became not his yeares or condition, raiseth up, as it were, from the grave, her old grandfather Appius Caecus, and out of his mouth delivereth a sage and fatherly admonition to her. In like manner (right Reverend) receiving the charge from you to give the charge unto you at this present, and being over-ruled by authority to speak some∣thing of the eminent authority & sacred dignity into which ye are now to be invested; I have brought upon this holy stage the first of your ranke, and auncientest of your Apostolicall order, to admonish you with authority both of your generall calling, as Pastours set over Christs flocke, and your speciall, as Bishops set over the Pastors themselves: That in the
former words, , feed; this in the latter, , bishoping, or ta∣king the over-sight of them. Both they are to performe, 1 Not by constraint: 2 Not for lucre. 3 Not with pride. 1 Not by constant: constraint standeth not with the dignity of the A∣postles successors. 2 Not for filthy lucre: filthy lucre sorts not with Gods Priests. 3 Not in, or with Lord-like pride: Lord-like pride complyeth not with the humility of Christs Ministers. As Tully the aged wrote to Cato the auncient, of old age; so in the words of my text Peter the Elder writeth to Elders, of the calling, life and reward of Elders in the Church of God. 1 Their function is feeding, and overlooking Christs flocke, enjoy∣ned ver. 2. 2 Their life is to be a patterne of all vertue, drawne ver. 3. 3 Their reward is a Crowne of glory, set before them ver. 4. 1 Their function sacred, answerable to their calling, which is divine. 2 Their life exemplary, answerable to their function, which is sacred. 3 Their reward, exceeding great, answerable to the eminency of the one, and excellency of the other. May it please you therefore to observe out of the words, 1 For your instruction, what your function is. 2 For correction, what your life should be. 3 For comfort, what your reward shall be. As the costlyExod. 28.14. ornaments of Aaron were fastened to the Ephod with golden chaines of writhen worke, so all the parts and points of the Apostles exhortation are artificially joyned and tyed together with excellent cohe∣rence, as it were with chaines of gold. This chaine thus I draw through them all. Feede.1 There are some of the ministery fitter to be fed and led like sheep, than to feed or lead like shepheards; they are hunger-starved themselves, ha∣ving no better provision than the Apostles had in the wildernesse after Christs miraculous feast,Matth. 14.20. a few baskets full of broken meat. SaintTantae cha∣ritatis sunt per quos nobis flu∣enta coelestia emanant, ut an∣tea effundere quam effundi velint, loqui quam audire paratiores, prompti docere quod nunquam didicerunt, Bernard. Ber∣nard admireth at their charity, saying, they by whom the streames of heaven∣ly doctrine flow to us, are of such superabundant charity, that they desire to empty themselves before they are halfe full, nay many before they have any drop of saving knowledge, and divine learning, most ready to deliver that which they never received, and teach what they never learned. Such a one was thatLactant. divin. instit. l. 5. Cum ccus ipse esser, alios illuminare suscepit in se. Bithynian whom Lactantius taketh up for taking upon him to
cure dimme and darke eyes, when himselfe was starke blinde. I finde nothing whereunto I may fitter resemble them, than to squibs or small fire-works, which as soone as they take fire, never leave popping and shoo∣ting, and making a hideous noyse, till all the powder be spent: so these ha∣ving rammed a little stuffe together, and being kindled with blinde zeale, never leave shooting and spitting fire in the pulpit, as long as their poore provision lasteth. These men, howsoever they are lyable to many other exceptions, yet all men will free them from the imputation which Foelix laid upon Saint Paul,Act. 26.24. much learning hath made thee madde. And as secure are they from the danger of the killing letter, as the Poet in his witty Epi∣gram playeth upon an ignorant Priest in time of Popery; Tho. Morus in epig.Tu bene cavisti ne te ulla occidere possit Litera, nam nota est litera nulla tibi. Thou hast taken good care that the killing letter shall not hurt thee, for thou knowest never a better in the booke. The measures of the Sanctuary con∣tained twise as much as the common measures, the shekel of the Sanctuary weighed downe two other shekels; to shew us that the gifts of a Pastour ought to carrie a double proportion to those of his flocke, else he had need to be fed himselfe; and is not qualified for this duty required in my text, in the first place, Feed. 2 Of those that are able to feed, some feed themselves, not their flocke;The flocke. like Varus, taxed by Velleius Paterculus, who came poore into a rich Pro∣vince, but went rich out of the poore Province; making a very gainefull exchange, by leaving them the povertie he brought with him, and taking with him the wealth hee found there. Feed yee not your selves but the Flocke. 3 Of those that feed the Flocke, some feed not Gods Flocke,Of God. but Sa∣tans heard; teaching in Conventicles of Heretikes, or Schismatikes. Waspes have their hives as well as Bees, and Pirats have their Pilots as well as ho∣nest Merchants: be not ye like them; feed not the droves of Satan or Anti∣christ, but the Flocke of God. 4 Of those that feed the Flocke of God,Among you. some feed not that Flocke which is among them, they are , Bishops in other mens Dio∣cesses; they thrust their sickle into anothers harvest, and discharge without a charge: they may rightly say with the Spouse in the Canticles,Cant. 1.6. They have made me (or rather I have made my selfe) a keeper of vineyards, but mine owne vineyard have I not kept. If the frogs ofPlin. nat. Inst. l. 8. Ranae mu∣tae sunt etiam nunc in Sery∣pho Insula, eae∣dem alio tran∣slatae canunt, &c. Seryphus could speake they would claime kindred of these men; for as those frogs in the Island where they are bred are dumbe, and make no noise at all, but carried to any o∣ther Countrie, fall on singing or croaking, and never give over: so these are silent and quiet in their owne cures, but when they are out of them none can be quiet for them: they who can scarce afford a Sermon in a moneth at their owne home, make nothing of lecturing every day in the weeke a∣broad. 5 Of those that feed the flocke of God which is among them, that is,Taking the over∣sight thereof. preach painefully and powerfully, some are not not  Overloo∣kers;
they take not the over-sight of their flocke, they have not an eye to their life and manners, they never use the reine, or rather curbe of ecclesia∣sticall discipline; forgetting that in the Arke of God, together with the Ta∣ble of the Testimony, and the Pot of Manna, the Rod of Aaron that budded was layd up: and that wherePsal. 23.4. David compareth God to a shepheard, he maketh mention both of his rod and staffe. Not by constraint6 Of those that feede the flocke of God that is amongst them, and take the oversight thereof, that is, both rule well, and labour in the word, some de∣serve not the double honour, because they doe it by constraint, not willing∣ly, like those Calves, and Bullocks, and Rams, that were pulled and haled to the Altars of the heathen gods, wherewithPlin. l. 8. nat. hist. c. 45. Hoc quo{que} notatum est, vitulos ad aras humeris homi∣num allatos, non fere litare, nec aliená ho∣stiâ placari de∣os, nec trahen∣te se ab aris. Pliny observeth that the Paynim deities were never pleased, nor gave good successe to them which offered such sacrifice unto them. Nature her selfe giveth a prerogative to thatPlin. nat. hist. l. 11. c. 15. In omni melle quod per se flu∣it, ut mustum, oleum{que} quod appellatur a∣caeton, maxime laudabile est. Not for filthy in∣cre. honey which drops out of the combe, before that which is forced or squized out; and to thatPlin. nat. hist. l. 12. c. 15. In∣ciduntur bis, sudant autem sponte prius∣quam incidan∣tur stacten di∣ctam. oyle which sweats out of the Myrrhe trees, is∣suing from thence of it owne accord, before that which runneth after prick∣ing or incision. The noblest pallat wine is made of that liquor of the grape which spinneth out upon the smallest touch, without any violent pres∣sure: Theog. gnom.. 7 Of those that take the over-sight of the flocke, not by constraint but willingly, some doe it not freely, or of a ready minde, but for filthy lucre. The Eccho taught by Erasmus, rings this in the eares of the Laity, and they heare it briefe, Quid venatur sacerdos? . AndPlat. in Bon. 3. Re verâ pace bonorum di∣cam, multi e∣piscopatum de∣siderant, ex∣plendae avari∣tiae suae causa, non quo com∣muni utilitati ut eorum ex∣poscit officium & nomen, consulant: quaeritur enim quantum red∣dat episcopa∣tus, non quot oves pascuae in eo sint. Platina giveth a touch hereof in the life of Pope Goodface the third; the first question is, af∣ter a man is chosen Pope, what is the Bishopricke of Rome worth? Fil∣thy lucre carrieth such an ill favour with it, that the precious oyntment of Aaron cannot take away the smell thereof. Covetousnesse is a spot in any coat, but a stain in the linnen Ephod: what so unfit? what so incongruous? nay what so opprobrious and scandalous, as for those who in scripture are stiled Angels, and should like Angels, by continuall meditations, and di∣vine contemplations behold the face of God in heaven, to turne earth-wormes, and lye and feed upon very mucke? How dare they deliver the holy Sa∣crament with those hands that have received bribes? or are defiled with the price of blood? or are foule with telling their use-money? Holinesse (which of all other most be fitteth our sacred calling) in the greeke imply∣eth a contradiction to earthlinesse: , which wee render holy, is all one in that language as unearthly. If a glasse bee soyled with dust, or be ea∣red with dirt, it reflecteth no image at all: in like manner if the minde bee soyled with the dust of earthlinesse, the image of God cannot appeare in it; the fancie of such a man will represent no spirituall forme, conceive no divine or heavenly imaginations. If wee seeke our owne and not the things that are Jesus Christs, the goods not the good of our flocke, wee lose the first letter of our name in the ProphetEzek. 3.17. Sonne of man, I have made thee a watchman. Ezekiel, and of speculatores become peculatores, and are not to be termed praedicatores but praedatores. But I will not make this blot bigger by unskilfully going about to take it out.
8 Of those that feede,Not as Lords. and take the over-sight of Gods flocke that is among them, not by constraint but willingly, not for filthy lucre; but of a ready minde, some carry themselves like Lords over the flocke, not as ensamples to their flock, they goe in and out before them in a stately and lordly gate,Concil. Carthag 4. . fu∣mosus seculity∣phus. , in swelling pride, not in exemplary humility, seeking rather to o∣ver-rule them with terrour and violence, than rule over them with the spi∣rit of meeknesse. These though they are put up to the highest fourme, yet have not learned the first lesson in the schoole of Christianity,Matth. 11.29.to be meek and lowly in heart: neither understand they that divine graces, which are the plants of Paradise, are like to the tree in the Poet that bare golden boughes: Virg. Aen. 6.—Quae quantum vertice ad auras Aethereas tantum, radice in Tartara tendit. whose root was just so much beneath the earth as the top was in height a∣bove it. The higher Gods Saints grow upwards to perfection, the deeper they take root downward in humility, considering that they have nothing of their owne, but sinne; and what a foolish and impious sinne of pride is it, to bee proud of sinne? He that presumes on his owne strength, saith ho∣ly Austine, is conquered before hee fight. To repose trust in our selves, saithBern. serm. 20. in vigil. nat. dom. Sibimet ipsi fi∣dere, non fidei sed perfidiae est, nec confiden∣tiae sed diffi∣dentiae magis, in semetipso habere fiduci∣am. Bernard, is not of faith, but perfidiousnesse, neither breeds it true confidence, but diffidence. To bee proud of knowledge, is to bee blinde with light: to bee proud of vertue is to poyson himselfe with the Anti∣dote: and to be proud of authority, is to make his rise his downefall, and his ladder his ruine. It is the darke foyle that giveth the Diamond its brightest lustre: it is the humble, and low, and obscure conceit of our owne worth that giveth lustre and grace to all our vertues and perfections, if we have any: Moses glory was the greater because his face shined, and he knew not of it. Thus have I numbred unto you the severall linkes of the Apostles gol∣den chaine of instructions for Pastors, now let us gather them together in a narrow roome. 1 Be not such as neede to be fed, but are able and willing to feede. 2 Feede not your selves but the flocke. 3 Feede not the flocke or droves of Antichrist, but the flocke of God. 4 Feede the flocke of God, not out of your charge, or without you, but the flocke of God which is among you. 5 Content not your selves with feeding them onely with the Word and Sacrament, but over-looke them also, have an eye to their manners. 6 Doe this not constrainedly, but willingly. 7 Not out of private respects, but freely. 8 Not proudly but humbly; not to shew your authority over the flock, but to set before them an ensample in your selves of humility, meekenesse, temperance, patience, and all other vertues. Thus feede the flocke of God that is among you, thus rule those whom you feede, thus carry yourselves towards those whom you rule, thus give good ensample in your carriage; and when the chiefe shepheard and Bi∣shop
of your soules Christ Jesus shall appeare, you shall receive in stead of a Crosier a Scepter, of a Miter a Crowne, of a Diocesse upon earth a King∣dome in heaven. You see I have a large and plentifull field before mee, yet I purpose at this time to follow the example of the Apostles,Matth. 12.1. who as they passed through the corne field, plucked only an eare or two, and rubbed them in their hands. To rub the first eare, that you may see what graine it yeeldeth. To feed, saithl. 1. de Rom. pont. c. 15. In scripturis pas∣cere passim ac∣cipitur pro re∣gere, ut psal. 2. reges cos in virgâ ferreâ: in Heb. est pas∣ce  & Apoc. 2.27.  Bellarmine, signifieth to rule with princely authority, to sway the scepter as a spirituall Prince over Christs flocke; and to this purpose hee alledgeth that text in the Apocalyps, 2.27.  hee shall feede (or rule) them with a rod of iron: hard feeding for Christs sheepe; hee had need to have an Estridge's stomacke that can digest this interpretation here. Feed, not over-ruling, ver. 3. that is, over-rule them, not feeding: this is as natu∣rall an interpretation of this scripture, as the glosse upon the word statui∣mus in the Canon law, id est, abrogamus, or statuimus quod non; wee enact, that is, wee abrogate; we command, that is, wee forbid; we appoint this, that is, wee appoint that this shall not bee. If this be a right interpretation of this place, and the other parallel to it in SaintJoh. 20.17. John, then SaintBernard. de considerat. ad Eu∣gen. l. 2. I ergo tu & tibi usur∣pare aude aut dominans apo∣stolatum, aut apostolicus do∣minatum, &c. Ber∣nard was in the wrong, for hee inferres the cleane contrary from it: and which is most considerable, in a booke of consideration dedicated to the Pope himselfe: Peter could not give thee that which he had not; what he had, that he gave thee, care over the Churches: but did hee not also give thee do∣minion? heare what himselfe saith, not as being Lords over Gods heritage but being made examples to the flocke: lest any man should thinke that this was spoken onely in humility, and not in truth, it is the voice of the Lord in the Gospell, Kings of the nations beare rule over them, but it shall not bee so with you; it is plaine that Lord-like dominion is forbidden to the Apostles: goe too therefore now, and assume to thy selfe if thou dare, either the office of an Apo∣stle, if thou be a Lord, or Lord-like Dominion if thou be an Apostle. Howbeit I deny not that the word  here used, sometimes signifieth to rule with Princely authority, and Lord-like command, both in Scriptures and prophane Writers: asHom. Il. 1. Homer stileth King Agamemnon , the Shepheard of the people: so God himselfe calleth Cyrus hisEsay 44.28. That saith of Cy∣rus, he is my shep∣heard. Shepheard; and which is very observable, Cyrus as if hee had taken notice of this name imposed by God upon him before his birth, was wont usually to say,Xen. Cyr. poed. l. 8. . That a good Prince was like a good Shepheard, who can by no other meanes grow rich, than by making his flocke to thrive under him; the prospe∣rity of the subject is not only the honour but the wealth also of the Prince. All this maketh nothing for the Popes triple Crowne, to which hee layeth claime by vertue of Christs threefold pasce, or feede (Joh. 21.15.16.17.) for neither doth  originally, nor properly, nor usually signifie to reigne as a King, especially when oves meae, or grex domini, my sheepe, or the flocke of God is construed with it; nor can it be so taken here, or Joh. 21. as the light of both texts set together reflecting one upon the other will cleer the point. For that which Christ enjoyneth Peter, Joh. 21. that Peter here enjoyneth all Elders: the words of the charge are the same, Feede my sheepe, there; Feede the flocke of God, here. But Saint Peter enjoyneth not
all Elders in these words to rule with soveraigne authority as Kings over the whole flocke, or as Lords over their owne peculiar: for this hee ex∣pressely forbiddeth, ver. 3. therefore to usurpe authority over the whole Church, or to domineere over any part thereof, is not to feede ac∣cording to Christs charge to Saint Peter, or Saint Peters to all Elders. What is it then? if you have reference to the Etymology  is , to feede, as the word imports in the originall, is to reside upon our cure, or abide with our flocke, where the spouse is commanded to seeke Christ,Cant. 1.8.goe thy way forth to the footsteps of the flocke. And indeed where should the Sentinell be but upon his watch-tower? where the Pilot but at the sterne? where the intelligence but at his orbe? where the sunne but within his ecliptick line? where the candle but in the candle-stick? where the diamond but in the ring? where the shepheard but among his flocke? whom hee is to feede, for whom he is to provide, of whom hee is to take the over-sight, to whom hee ought to bee an example; which hee cannot be if hee never be in their sight. But because this observation is grounded only upon the Etymology, I will lay no more stresse upon it. The proper and full signification of the word is pastorem agere, to play the good shep∣heard, or exercise the function of a Pastor, which consisteth in three things especially: 1 Docendo quid facere debeant. 2 Orando ut facere possint. 3 Increpando si non faciant. 1 In teaching those of his flock what they ought to doe. 2 In praying that they may doe it. 3 In reproving if they doe it not. All which may bee reduced to a threefold feeding: 1 With the Word, Jer. 3.Jer. 3.15. I will give you pastors according to mine owne heart, that shall feede you with knowledge and understan∣ding. 2 With the Sacraments, Apoc. 2. & Joh. 6. 3 With the Rod, Micah 7.14. To feed with the Word and Sacraments is the common duty of all Pa∣stors, but to feed with the rod is reserved to Bishops: they are Seraphims, holding the spirituall sword of excommunication in their hands, to guard the tree of life: whose speciall office, and eminent degree in the Church is implyed in the word , which the vulgar latine rendereth provi∣dentes, but SaintAug. de civ. l. 19 c. 19. Supervi∣dentes appel∣lantur, ut intel∣ligant se non es∣se episcopos qui prae esse di∣lexerint, non prodesse. Austine more agreeable to the Etymology, superviden∣tes, super-visours, or super-intendents. Yet this is but a generall notation of the name; every Bishop is a super-visour or over-seer, but every super-visour is not a Bishop. The Lacedaemonian Magistrates were called Ephori, which is an equivalent stile to Episcopi: andEuseb. vit. Con∣stant . Constantine the great spake as truely as piously to his Bishops; Yee reverend Fathers are Bishops of them that are within the Church, but I of them that are out of the Church: where your pastorall staffe is too short, I will piece it out and lengthen it with my scepter.  in the most proper and restreyned signification,
is to exercise Episcopall authority (or performe the office of a Bishop) which consisteth in two things: 1 In ordaining. 2 Ordering. 1 Giving orders. 2 Keeping order. Saint Paul givethTit. 1.5. Titus both in charge: for this cause left I thee in Crete, to ordaine Elders in every Church, there is the first, to wit, ordina∣tion; and to set in order things that are wanting, or , to correct things out of order, there is the second, viz. ordering or reformation. Timothy like∣wise the first consecrated Bishop of Ephesus is put in minde of these bran∣ches of his Episcopall function: of the first,1 Tim. 5.22.19 Lay hands suddenly on no man: of the second, Against an Elder receive not an accusation but under two or three witnesses:ver. 20. Them that sinne rebuke before all, that others also may feare. Be notver. 22. partaker of any other mans sinnes, to wit, by not censuring or pu∣nishing them. These two offices to bee most necessary in the Church, e∣very mans reason and common experience will informe us. For how shall wee have Ministers at all without ordination? and how shall wee have good Ministers or people without visitation? Now for Presbyters or Mi∣nisters, who are equall in degree to exercise authority one over the other, and lay hands upon themselves, & so to become their own ghostly Fathers, is to make order it selfe a confusion. Therefore God in the law put a diffe∣rence between the Priests and Levits: and Christ in the gospell between the Apostles and Disciples; and the Apostles after Christs death between Bishops and Elders. Which the primitive Church kept so religiously, that to oppose it in practice was accounted no lesse thanAct. Concil. 1. Chalced. . sacriledge; in do∣ctrine, flat heresie. The first that I finde ever to have gone about to break downe the partition wall betweene Bishops and Presbyters, was Aerius, a man like his name, light and aery, easily carried away with the winde of ambition. For asEpiph. haeres. 71. Cum epi∣scopatus spe excidisset Eu∣stathio postha∣bitus, ut se con∣solaretur hanc haeresem exco∣gitavit. . Epiphanius writeth, standing for a Bishopricke, and missing it, hee invented this heresie to comfort himselfe; and because hee could not raise up himselfe to the high ranke of Bishops, hee sought to pull them downe to his lower ranke of Elders. What difference, saith he, is there betweene a Bishop and a Priest? none at all, their order, and honour, and dignity, is one and the selfe-same. But for this his sawcy malepartnesse he felt the smart of the Crosier staffe, and for ranking Bishops among Presby∣ters or Elders, he was himself ranked among hereticks. God who made grea∣ter & lesser lights in the firmament, and set Angels in ranks one above ano∣ther, hath erected anSee King James his Cyg∣nea Cantio. Bilson his perpe∣tuall governe∣ment. Bancroft his slavey of the ho∣ly pretended discipline, c. de episc. Downam his sermon at the consecration of the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Andrew opus posthum. Hallier defenc. ecclesiast. hierar. l. 1. Aurelius vindi∣ciae censurae tit. 3. de epis. & cura∣tis. Hierarchy upon earth: which as he hath ever yet, so I hope he still will to the end of the world establish and support and propa∣gate it, as it hath wonderfully supported and propagated the Church. The bounds therof extended by the preaching, & kept by the government of Bi∣shops; the Hereticks and Schismaticks in all ages suppressed by Councels and Synods of Bishops; the Rubricks of Ecclesiasticall Kalendars coloured with the blood of so many martyred Bishops, are sufficient evidence there∣of.
And as the Church soone after her first plantation exceedingly pro∣spered under the shade of James Bishop of Jerusalem, Titus of Crete, Ti∣mothy of Ephesus, Marke of Alexandria, Ignatius of Antioch, Antipas of Pergamus, Polycarpe of Smyrna, and divers others ordayned by the Apo∣stles, or their immediate successors; and in succeeding ages received her best sap and nourishment from the Greeke and Latine Fathers, who for the most part were Bishops: soBeza de grad. Min. evang. cap. 18. Non tantum insig∣nes Dei mar∣tyres, sed etiam praestantissi∣mos doctores & pastores. Beza himselfe acknowledgeth it to have beene the singular happinesse of the Church of England, which he prayeth may be perpetuall, that this reverend and sacred order hath yeelded not only famous Martyrs, but also most excellent Doctors and Pastors. As the Poet blazing the vertues of the Emperour then reigning, said, Mart. epig. l. 1. Te volet invictus pro libertate Camillus: Si Cato reddatur, Caesarianum erit. Brutus and Camillus and Cato, the greatest sticklers for the liberty of the commonwealth, if they were now alive would turne Royalists: so wee may truely affirme that the greatest enemies of Episcopall jurisdiction, could not but approve of such Bishops as now sit at the sterne in our Church. And what if all are not such? must the whole order suffer for their sake? Ovid l. 1. de art. Desine paucorum diffundere crimen in omnes. lay not upon all the fault of some. If one or other budde of Aarons rod, the bishopricke of Rome and the dependants thereon, are turned into serpents, shall the whole rod bee cast out of the Arke, and Jonah's gourd put in the place thereof? I meane the new sprung up mushrome, the go∣vernement of lay Elders; Elders whereof no elder age of the Church ever took notice, and the younger cannot tell yet how to christen them: because they are a kind of epicoens, of both genders, plant-animals, partly animals, partly plants: like a sort of Nuns at Bruxels, partly regular partly secular; in the morning wearing the cowles and habit of Recluses, in the afternoone the feathers and other attire of Gallants. For they are Clergy-laickes, and Lay-clerkes: of their clergy they are, for they together with their Mini∣sters ordaine Ministers, and inflict ecclesiasticall censures; and yet laickes they are, for they may not preach nor baptize. Church-men they are, for they beare rule in the Church; yet church-men they are not, for they may receive no maintenance from the Church. They are the Elders that rule well, and labour, not in the word, for such they will have intimated by S. Paul; yet the honour which their owne Interpreters there expound honourable maintenance, is not due unto them. Spare me Men, Fathers, and Brethren, if I spare not them who goe about to bereave us of our spirituall Fathers, qui saeviunt in plagas & vulnera ecclesiae, who seeke to ruine the ruines, and spoile the very spoiles of ecclesiasticall dignity and distinction left among us. To place such Bats as these, rather mice than birds, must Christs Apo∣stles and their successors be displaced, and all rankes of ecclesiasticall or∣der confounded: is there any justice in this, to breake all Crosier staves,
and tread all Miters under foot, and teare all Rochets in pieces Unius ob noxam & furias Ajacis Oilei. for the usurpations and tyranny of one Bishop the Pope of Rome? By this reason take away the reverend order of the Apostles for Judas sake, take away the sacred order of Prophets for Balaams sake, take away the soveraigne order of Princes for Julians sake, take away the glorious orbs of starres for the starres sake calledApoc. 8.11. wormewood in the Apocalyps, nay take away the highest regiment of Angels for Lucifers sake, and the rest of his faction, somtime in the highest order in heaven, but now reserved in chaines of darkenesse till the great day. This may suffice to bee spoken of, and for your calling: two words of the two duties implyed in the words,  and , feede, and take the over-sight. You are Pastors and Bishops, make good your titles, feede as Pastors, take the over-sight of your Diocesse as Bishops. The three or∣ders in the Church, Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, resemble the three fa∣culties of the soule, the vegetative, sensitive, and reasonable. For as the sensitive faculty includeth the vegetative, & aliquid amplius and somewhat more, to wit, sense; and the reasonable implyeth the sensitive, & aliquid amplius and somewhat more, to wit, reason; so a Priest implieth a Deacon, & aliquid amplius; and a Bishop imply∣eth a Priest, & aliquid amplius. Yee are (my Lords) both Bishops and Priests, and as you are invested into a double honour, so you have a double charge: as Bishops you are to rule well; as Priests to labour in the word: as Priests you are to preach, as Bishops to ordaine Priests, and countenance Preachers: as Priests you are to smite simony and sacri∣ledge, schisme and heresie, impurity and impiety, gladio oris, with the sword of your mouth; as Bishops, ore gladii, with the mouth, that is, the edge of the sword, the sword of ecclesiasticall censures which Christ hath put in∣to your hand: beare not this sword in vaine, be not partakers of the sinnes of any of the clergy, or bribes of the laity; use this your sword for, not a∣gainst the Church: Virg. Aen. 4.Non hos quaesitum munus in usus. Hold not too strict a hand over your too much oppressed Clergy; let it not be said of the clergy of your Diocesse, as it was said of the Roman soul∣diers under Severus, that they were more afraid of their Captaine than of the enemy. For as Saint Paul speaketh to the Corinthians, if I make you sad who shall comfort you? so may I say to you, if you dishearten poore Ministers who shall comfort them, or stand for them? the laity? no, they take too much of the nature of the stone, from whence they have their name given them, signifieth people,  a stone.  from : if a faithful minister of Jesus Christ, if a diligent preacher that spends his oile & week, his body and soul to give them light; sue but for his dues, especially if he mutter but a word against their great Diana, their sacrilegious customes, which oft deprive the ministers of the Gospell of nine parts of the Tenth, and leave them but decimam decimae, the tenth of the tenth; they will all fall upon him, and unlesse your power and authority relieve him, grinde him to powder. They use their godly Preachers, whom the world cannot parallel, as the Hawke in He∣siod
dealt with the melodious Nightingale,Hesiod. op. & dies l. 1. they plume them and devoure them, , although they bee the sweetest singers of Israel. Many of them after they have spent their strength in preaching in season and out of season, catechizing and lecturing on the Lords day, and on the weeke dayes, may truely say as Synesius sometimes complayned that they carried nothing away from their parishes or cures, but bonam conscientiam & malam valetudinem, a good conscience, and an ill and crzed body. No more of , taking the over-sight: and but a word of , feede, lest whilest I exhort you to feede, I detaine you from better feeding, viz. upon the blessed Sacrament now set before you. As in Churches and Noble-mens hals, where there hang great Candlestickes with many branches, the lights are first let downe to bee tinded, and when they are fully lighted, then they are drawne up by degrees to give light to the whole roome: so our Church first sendeth her sweet waxe lights, made and formed in private schooles, downe to the Universities to bee tinded, and when they are fully enlightned with knowledge, then draweth them up by degrees, first to pastorall charges, then to dignities, Deaneries, and Bishopricks; not that then they should bee put out, but to the end that as they are set higher they should give more light. You are, right Reverend, the silver Trumpet of Zion, whom God lifteth up on high that you may sound the louder & shriller, as bels are hung higher in the steeple, that they may bee heard further. Let it bee never said of you as it was of Saul, that when hee came to the high places he made an end of prophecying. The more God hath honoured you, the more you ought to honour him; the higher Christ hath preferred you, the more you ought to love him, and shew this your love by your treble diligence in feeding his sheepe. To which end these words, Peter lovest thou me? feed my sheep, &c. are by the order of our Church appointed to bee read for the Gospell at your consecration. I grant you feede many wayes; you feede when you appoint pastors to feed, you feede when you instruct them how to feede, you feede when you cen∣sure them for not feeding their flockes, or not feeding them with whole∣some food, you feede in a Synode when you make good canons, you feede in your visitations when you encourage good Ministers, and reforme abu∣ses in the Church, lastly, you feede at your tables when you keepe good hospitality. And after all these manners the Apostles and ancient Fathers fed; yet they thought themselves in danger of a vae, or curse if they fed not by preaching the Gospell in their owne persons. Woe bee to mee, saith Saint1 Cor. 9.16. Paul, if I preach not the Gospell. Saint Gregory was a Bishop himselfe, and that of a very large and troublesome Diocesse (for hee was Pope of Rome) yet hee deepely chargeth Bishops with this duety, thus inferring upon Christs words to Peter, lovest thou mee? feed, &c.Greg. in verb. evang. secundum Johan. Si dile∣ctionis argu∣mentum est cu∣ra pastoralis, quisquis virtu∣tibus pollens gregem Dei re∣nuit pascere, summum pasto∣rem convinci∣tur non amare. If care and dili∣gence in a pastorall charge be an argument, and certaine evidence of the love wee beare to Christ, whosoever furnished with gifts and abilities thereunto, refuseth to feede Christs flocke, is to be taken pro convicto, that hee beares no good affection to the chiefe Pastor and Bishop of our souls. If the love of Christ constrayned us not to stirre up the grace of God in us, which wee have re∣ceived by imposition of hands, and even like lampes to spend our selves to give light to our flockes; yet methinkes the excellency of this function
should enflame us thereunto. Where can we fixe our thoughts with more delight and contentment than upon heaven and heavenly objects? how can wee put our tongues to a better use than to declare the word of life? to preach the Gospell of the Kingdome? to sound out our makers praises? how can our hands be better employed than about the seales of grace? Heare SaintChrysost. homil. 1. in Matth. , &c. Chrysostome open his golden mouth, and weigh his words in the scales of the sanctuary: Seest thou not, saith hee, how thine eyes water whilest thou stayest in the smoake, but are cleared and refreshed if thou goe out into the open ayre, or walkest a turne in a pleasant garden? so the eye of our minde is cleared, and our spirituall senses much revived by walking in the garden of holy Scriptures, and smelling to the flowers of Paradise; but if wee run about in the smoake, that is, busie our selves about earthly affaires, we shall shed many a teare, and be in danger of quite losing our sight. I will conclude, and briefely represent all the principall points of the A∣postles exhortation to your view in one type of the law. In the Arke of the covenant there was the rod ofExod. 24.25. Aaron that budded, and about it a crown of gold. By the rod of Aaron you easily apprehend the Priests office or pastorall charge: the buds of this rod, or parts of this charge are two, fee∣ding and overseeing; which ought to bee performed not by constraint, but willingly, as the buddes were not drawne out of Aarons rod, but put forth of their owne accord. And herein wee are not to respect our owne good, but the good of our flocke: wee must doe nothing for filthy lucre, but of a free minde to benefit others, as the rod of Aaron bare not blossomes or fruit to, or for it selfe, but to, and for others. By the fruits of Aarons rod you may understand the good life of a faithfull Pastor, who is to be an example to his flock; this fruit enclineth him to true humility opposite to Lord-like pride, as the fruit of a tree weigheth the branches downe to the earth. Lastly, by the Crowne above the rod, and round about the Arke, is represen∣ted the reward of a faithfull Shepheard and vigilant Bishop. You have the embleme of your office, the word or Motto shall be Germinet virga Aaro∣nis, Let the rod of Aaron blossome in your mouths by preaching the word, and budde in your hands by the exercise of ecclesiasticall discipline, and beare fruit in your lives by being ensamples to your flocke, and the crowne a∣bove the rod, and about the Arke shall bee yours, as it is promised, ver. 4. And when the chiefe shepheard shall appeare, you shall receive a crowne of glory that fadeth not away; Which God the Father grant for the price of his Sonnes blood, to whom with the holy Spirit be all honour, glory, praise, and thanks-giving, now and for ever, Amen.
THE TREE OF SAVING KNOVVLEDGE: OR Schola Crucis, Schola Lucis, A Sermon preached in Lent, March 16. before the King at White-hall. THE TWELFTH SERMON. 1 COR. 2.2. I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. IF any here present bee of so dainty eares, and delicate a palate, that wholesome meat will not downe with them, unlesse it bee curiously dressed by art, and ex∣quisitely dished, and set forth with variety of costly sawces; I desire them to consider that there may bee intemperancy in the eare as well as the taste, and that to feede such a luxurious humour in them, were a kind of breach of the holy Fast wee now keep. Where beautifull pictures, and sacred imagery are most in use (I should say abuse) I meane in the Church of Rome, during the whole time of Lent, sadP. Moul. cont. Coeffet p. 2. curtaines, and darke vailes are drawn before them: and in like maner our divine Apelles's, if they have any rare and eminent piece for stuffe as well as workmanship by them, they may doe well to vaile or shadow them at this season, that art may sympa∣thize with religion, and humane learning, as it were, put on blacks, when di∣vine puts on sacke cloth. For my selfe, I need make no other Apology to you than the Apostle doth to the Corinthians, in my text. The words which I handle are a warrant for the plaine handling thereof; for what is I deter∣mined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified, but in effect to say, IChrys. in Gen. orat. 41. . purposed not to make any banquet, I bid you to no feast, I have provided you but one dish of meate, the Lambe of God, and it but ordinarily dressed, broached upon the Crosse, that is, Jesus Christ, and him crucified?
Too exact division hath the same inconvenience withuinct. instit. orat. l. 4. Id viti um habet nimia quod nulla divisio, confu∣so simile est quicquid in plverem us{que} secatur, deinde cum fecerunt multas partiu∣las in eandem incidant ob∣scuritatem, con∣tra quam in∣venta partitio est. The division. want of divisi∣on: for it breedeth confusion, which it should prevent, and troubleth the memory, which it should helpe and ease. As to handle severall parts with∣out premising a convenient partition, is to teare asunder, and not to carve up: so on the contrary, over-curiously to divide upon division, and sub-di∣vide sub-divisions, is to crumble not breake the bread of life; or as Fabius speaketh, frusta facere, non membra, that is, to mince, and not (as the Apo∣stle requireth) rightly to divide the word of truth. May it please you there∣fore to goe along with me through the few parts of this facile and passa∣ble division. 1 The profession of the Apostle, I determined to know. 2 The object of his profession, positively, Jesus Christ. privatively, nothing but him. 3 The condition of the object, And him crucified. As theZab lib. de tri∣b pragnitis. Logicians in the subjects of all sciences distinguish rem conside∣ratam, & modum considerandi; the matter considerable, which they call the materiall object, and the manner of considering it, which they call the formall: as in Physick the res considerata, or material object, is corpus huma∣num mans body, the modus considerandi, or formall object, is quá sanabile, as curable: in Musick the res considerata is numerus, number, the modus con∣siderandi is quá sonorus as it is found in sounds, and serveth to harmony: So here the res considerata, the thing, or rather person to bee considered is Jesus Christ; the modus considerandi manner of considering him, is quà cru∣cifixus, as crucified. The best nurture is in the schoole of the crosse, but then this crosse must bee the crosse of Christ Jesus, and Christ Jesus must bee knowne, and lastly this knowledge must bee desired, or resolved to bee got. 1 Nothing is more to bee desired than knowledge, I desire, or have de∣termined to know. 2 No knowledge more to be desired than of Jesus Christ, Nothing but Jesus Christ. 3 Nothing of Jesus Christ is more to bee desired to bee knowne, than that hee was crucified, And him crucified. Of all things knowledge is most to be set by, forJoh. 17.3. this is life eternall to know thee to be very God, and whom thou hast sent Jesus Christ. Of all knowledge this of Christ is most excel∣lent,Phil. 3 8. for I account, saith the Apostle, all things as dung in comparison of the knowledge of Christ. Of all Christian knowledge this of the crosse is most comfortable; forGal. 6.14. God forbid, saith hee, that I should rejoice in any thing save in the crosse of Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. These points I shall cleare to your understanding, and presse upon your devout affections, Gods grace assisting, your patience en∣couraging, and the time permitting me. I determined to know nothing among you, &c. No people under the cope of heaven were more desirous of knowledge, or capable of a greater mea∣sure thereof, than the Corinthians, that were Pupilla Graeciae, the apple of Greece, the eye of the world; and none more furnished with divine and hu∣mane
knowledge than my Apostle, whose portion, especially of acquired learning, was like to Benjamins (of whose tribe hee was)Gen. 43.34. five times grea∣ter than his brethren. Eras. Adag. Yet this every way accomplisht Doctor of the Gen∣tiles, so inriched with all knowledge, at Corinth the prime City of Greece, the Royall Exchange (if I may so speake) of all arts and sciences, whither men of ordinary ranke and quality might not easily have accesse; among these who heard of Saint Paul, that hee had beene2 Cor. 12.2. rapt up into the third heaven, and expected that hee should utter unto them what hee saw and heard there, hee will bee knowne to know nothing save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. All that hee tooke up at Gamaliels feet hee layed downe at Christs; hee buried his jewels of Egypt which cost him so deare, under the wood of the crosse, as Jacob did Labans idollsGen. 35.4. under the oake at Si∣chem. Hee not onely under-valueth them in respect, but maketh no rec∣koning of them. I esteeme nothing of any, nor will bee esteemed for any knowledge, save of Jesus Christ and him crucified.The coherence. Which words are spoken by the Apostle here by way of apology to certaine of the Corinthians, who, prepossessed with the false Apostles, making great shew of learning and eloquence, could not away with the Apostles plainer and simpler kinde of teaching, without ostentation of art or mixture of secular learning. To these hee ad∣dresseth himselfe after this manner, ver. 1. And I, brethren, when I came un∣to you, came not with excellency of words, or wisedome, declaring unto you the testimony of God: For I determined not to know any thing among you save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. My speech, and my preaching was not with en∣ticing words of mans wisedome, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of power, that your faith might not stand in the wisedome of man, but in the power of God. In effect he confesseth that his words were not so pickt,The sense. his phrase so choice, his composition so smooth, his sentences so fluent, his cadences so sweet, his language so polite, his stile so flourishing, or his lines so strong, as were those of the false Apostles, who with their puffed up eloquence and word wisedome sought to bring into contempt the simplicity of the Gospell. I seeke not, saith hee (in effect) to approve my doctrine unto you by Tropes of Rhetorike, or Syllogismes of Logicke, or Axiomes of Philosophy, but by the evidence of the Spirit. I professe no science among you but the science of the crosse: and surely the plainest and sim∣plest method and manner of teaching best fitteth it. Were it decent and agreeable, thinke you, to treat of God his emptying himselfe in swelling words? to speake of Christ his abasing himselfe in a lofty stile? to dis∣course sweetly upon gall and vinegar? to beset nailes and thornes with flowers of Rhetoricke? and to bring our Saviour in pompe of words and vaine-glorious pageants of art to his crosse? Let them make ostentation of their learning and eloquence who preach themselves; I that am a Mi∣nister of Christ and called to preach him, make conscience to adde any thing of mine owne that may detract from him, or any way obscure the doctrine of the Gospell. The Ministers of the word may esteeme of secular learning in it's ranke, but they must not as if they were making merchandise thereof, expose it to sale in their sermons: they must not seek to value themselves chiefly by it,
or make any shew or ostentation thereof to the obscuring, or any way disparaging the doctrine of the Gospell. There are many simples goe to the making of a soveraigne Electuary, which yet cannot bee discerned in it when it is made: wee see not the honey-suckles and other sweet flowers which Kine feede upon in the spring, Virg Geor. 4.Attamen occultum referunt in lacte saporem; yet wee have the taste of them in the milke. The Prince of the Romane Oratours illustrateth the like observation by a similitude drawne from those that walke in the sunne;Cic. de orat. l. 1 who though they walke not to that end to bee sunne-burnt, yet if they walke long they will bee so: in like manner though a man study not the arts to this end to gaine an opinion of learning or skill in them, nay though hee conceale art (which is a high point of art) with all possible art; yet by that which hee performeth in his pleading of causes it will appeare how hee hath profited in them. I determine to know nothing, &c. The Apostle seemeth to bee very flat upon the negative, and by a kinde of Ostracisme to banish all eminency of secular learning out of the schoole of Christ: yet as SaintChrysin hunc cum. Chrysostome well notes, hee doth not absolutely condemne humane learning and elo∣quence, wherein himselfe excelled; for that had beene to slurre his owne perfections: but the edge of his Apostolicall reprehension falleth upon the abuse, ostentation, or over-prising it to the prejudice of the knowledge of Christ crucified. I know the ground I now tread upon is slippery, and therefore I must carefully looke to my feete lest they slide on either side. To derogate from the all-sufficiency of Scripture is sacriledge and blasphe∣my; and on the other side, to detract from the worth and credite of arts and sciences is anabaptisticall frenzie; the truth in the middle may bee laid downe in this Aphorisme, Scripture is of it selfe abundantly sufficient for us, but we are not sufficient for it without the help of the arts, or, as we terme them, liberall sciences. Wee cannot sufficiently either conceive our selves, or declare to our hearers the works of God without naturall Philosophy, nor the law of God without morall, nor the attributes of God without the Metaphysickes, nor the dimensions of the Arke and Temple without the Mathematickes, nor the songs of Sion without Musicke and Poetry. Wee cannot interpret the text of Scripture without Grammar, analyze it with∣out Logicke, presse and apply it without Rhetoricke. Wherefore let Brownists and Separatists scoffe at University learning, as the Foxe in the Greeke Epigram disparageth the faire and ripe grapes on a high tree, be∣cause they were out of his reach; wee must be alwayes thankefull to God for his bounty to us, in enriching our schooles with this treasure. Which no way obscureth the glory, or diminisheth the price and excellency of the doctrine of the crosse; if in humility wee submit it to Scripture, and our selves to the holy Fathers of the Church their directions: which are three; 1 To purge and clense it. 2 To subject it to, and make it serve divine knowledge. 3 To use it moderately, without affectation; and modest∣ly, without ostentation.
1 To purge and cleanse it; for the best of it is but like oare, which must be washed, and passe through the stamping mill, and the fire too, before it make pure metall. St.Epist. 26. Sin adamaveris captivam muli∣erem, id est, sa∣pientiam secu∣larem, & ejus pulchritudine captus fueris, decalva eam, & illecebras crini∣um, & orna∣menta verbo∣rum cum emor∣tuis unguibus seca, lava cam prophetali ni∣tio, & multos tibi foetus cap∣tiva dabit. Jerome giveth sage counsell to any that fall in love with secular learning, which he there fitly tearmeth the Bondwoman: If, saith he, thou lovest the Bondwoman, and art taken with her beautie, cut off her haire, that is, her superfluous ornaments of words, and pare her nailes, and wash her with the Prophets soape; and then if thou marry her she will bring thee much fruit. Yet take heed thou dotest not upon her, nor too highly esteemest of her: such fond affection cost Heliodorus his Bishopricke, and Theopompus his wits; who, asJos. l. 12. ant. c. 2. Euseb. l. 8. Evang. praep. c. 1. Josephus and Eusebius write, when hee went about (as he thought) to adorne and embellish the Scripture with Greeke elo∣quence, was distracted and troubled in mind, and enforced to give over his in∣tended purpose. Whatsoever some men professe in words, it is evident that in their practice they under-value Scripture, and too high esteeme secular learning; whose chiefe labour is in their Sermons , to preach art and wit; or, as the Apostle speaketh, themselves, not Christ. Nei∣ther are those hearers free from this sacrilegious errour, robbing God of his honour, and the Scriptures of their excellency, who account those the ra∣rest Sermons which are no Sermons at all. Of which it may be said as the Country-man spake of a goodly head exquisitely painted, ; What an excellent scull is this, and yet there is no braine in it? A Sermon without divinity, fraught onely with picked phrases, and nume∣rous sentences, cannot be fitter compared than to Onesilus his head, of whichHerod. in Mel∣pom. Onesili ca∣put suspensum cum jam exina∣nitum esset exa∣men apum in∣gressum favo re∣fersit. Herodotus reporteth that it was empty of braine, and in stead thereof filled with hony combes.Eras. Apoph. l. 1. Lysander refused rich apparell made up after the luxuri∣ous garbe of the Sicilians, which Dionysius sent to his daughters, saying, Vereor ne his amictae turpes videantur. When the King of Persia sent toAelian. var. hist. l. 14. Antalcidas a garland of Roses, perfumed with sweet spices and o∣dours, the Lacedaemonian Captaine accepted of his good will, but found fault with his Present, saying, Rosarum odorem, naturae{que} fragrantiam artis adulteratione perdidisti. They whom it concerneth can well interpret and apply these stories to themselves; who if they will shew themselves faith∣full suitors for their Master, and not wooers for themselves, they must fol∣low Origens advice, and conceale Art as much as may be.In Exod. 34. Moses, saith he, comming from the mount put a vaile upon his face when it shone, that the people might not see it: so should the Preachers of the word obscure the shi∣ning of humane learning (especially in their homilies and exhortations to the people) lest the Crosse of Christ be made of none effect. TheMat. 23.19. gold sanctifieth not the Altar, but the Altar the gold: humane learning improveth not di∣vine, but contrariwise divine improveth it. The Arts are holy in their use onely, which is to attend upon sacred knowledge; and whilest they doe so the law intitleth them to some kinde of holinesse. Nam quae sacris serviunt profana non sunt: those things which serve holy things are not to be accounted profane. Now if the highest preferment that humane arts and sciences can aspire unto is to be hand-maids to the sacred and saving science of Divinity, they must not in their attendance on her exceed in their dresse, and flaunt it too much. Hagar may be arrayed decently to wait on her Mi∣stresse; but if shee begin to out-brave Sarah, she must be turned out of
doores. Neither St Paul's inlaying his Epistles with sentences of Aratus, Epimenides, and Heraclitus Ephesius, norScu de  gend ologia cum Tologia. Clemens his Stromata, nor Eu∣sebius his bookes De praeparatione Evangelica, nor St. Augustine his Tra∣ctts De Civitate Dei, nor any of the ancient Fathers (quoted by St.Hieron. epist. 84 He∣rome) embellishing their writings with all variety of humane learning, will warrant their practice who displace Scripture testimonies in their Ser∣mons, to make roome for Morall Essayes, Politicke Aphorismes, Philo∣sophicall Axiomes, or Poeticall Fictions. Epithets are ornaments of speech not to be contemned;Arist rht. l 3. . yet Archidamus, saith Aristotle, was much to blame for cloying his auditors with them, and using them as meats which hee should have used onely as sauces. St. Hierome in his Epistle to Marcella de∣servedly taxeth those women who were nimio candore deformes, who de∣formed their native beauty by painting themselves too white. AndQuin. l. 8. inst. orat c. 16. Ut af∣fert lumen cla∣vs purp raelo∣co insertus, ita certe neminem deceat plu ibus intextanotis vestis. Ne ocu∣l quidem in toto cpoe d certnce  centum oculis venustum dixeum. Quin∣tilian rightly observeth, that though the eyes be the most beautifull parts of the body, yet no man would account such a man as the Poets feign Ar∣gos to have beene, who had an hundred eyes, to be a comely or beautifull man. Pendants on the eares, a chaine of pearle on the necke, and bracelets on the armes, and rings with jwels on the fingers may doe well in noble Matrons: but to sticke the lips, and noses, and cheekes, and breast, and al∣most all parts of the body, as theBert us geo∣graph de Peru, &c. Peruvians doe, with precious stones, woundeth rather than adorneth that sexe. It is most commendable I grant to borrow of Egyptians jewels of gold, and silver, and rayment, to the end to offer them to God for the use of the Arke: but we must take heed that we make not Idols of these jewels, and secretly seeke to be worshipped in and by them. If any doe so, he that hathApoc. 1.14, 15. eyes like a flaming fire, and feet like fine brasse, will discerne their vaine-glorious pride, and stampe them and their Idols to powder. To close up this note, though not so fit for this quire, yet not to be skipt because prickt in the rules of my text, let all the Dispencers of Gods holy mysteries, by the Apostles example, strive in their preaching to winne soules to Christ, not applause to themselves; to pricke the heart, not tickle the eare; to leave in their hearers minds a perswasion of their doctrine, not opinion of their learning and eloquence; that is, in the Apostles phrase, to esteeme to know nothing save Jesus Christ. JESUS Mat. Epig. l. 9.Nomen cum rosis violis{que} natum, Quod hyblam sapit, atticosque flores, Quod nidos olet avis superbae, Nomen nectare dulcius beato. A name sweeter to the smell of the soule than roses, or violets, or all the A∣rabian spices in the Phoenix nest; and sweeter also to the taste than the A∣thenians hony, or Nectar it selfe. Nothing relished St. Augustine without it: Ignatius calleth Jesus his love and onely joy; Jesus amor meus cruci∣fixus, Jesus my love is crucified. This name Jesus was imposed by an AngelMat. 1.21. Mat. 1. and acknowledged by the DivelAct. 19.15. Jesus e know. Act. 19. and highly advanced by God himself above all namesPhil. 29. A name abot all names. Phil. 2. Three in the old Testament bare this name, and they were all types of Christ: Jesus Nave or Josua was a type of Christ as a King, Jesus in Zechary as a Priest, and Jesus the son of Syrach as a
Prophet to reveale the secrets of his Fathers wisdome. As all Josephs bre∣threns sheaves rose up & did homage to Josephs sheafe▪ so all the attributes of God and other names of our Redeemer, after a sort rise up and yeeld a kind of preheminence to this name, which the Apostle stileth aver. 10. a name above all names, at which every knee must bow. And the reason hereof is evident to all that have yeelding hearts and bending knees, and are not like the pillars in the Philistims Temple, which were so fast set in their sockets, that they needed a Sampson to bow them. For there is majesty in God, there is independent being in Jehovah there is power in Lord, there is un∣ction in Christ, there is affinity in Immanuel, intercession in Mediator, helpe in Advocate, but there isAct. 4.12. salvation in no name under heaven but the name of Jesus.  Which may bee taken either as a proper name, or as an ap∣pellative; if it bee taken as a proper name, it exhibiteth to the eye of our faith infinity defined, immensity circumscribed, omnipotency infirme, e∣ternity borne, that is, God incarnate: It designeth a single person of a dou∣ble nature, create and increate, soveraigne and subject, eternall and mortall: It is the name of the Sonne of God begotten of a Father without a Mother, and borne of a Mother without a Father, God of God, and Man of wo∣man. God sent from God, Man sent to man, God to save man, Man to sa∣tisfie God, God and Man to reconcile God and man.  If the word Jesus be taken appellatively it signifieth Saviour, or him that saveth us from 1 The wrath of God, 2 The power of Satan, 3 The guilt and dominion of sinne, 4 The sentence of the law, 5 The torments of hell. And to know Jesus in this acception, is to know a soveraigne salve for e∣very sore of the conscience, a remedy against all the diseases of the minde, a sanctuary for all offences, a shelter from all stormes, a supersedeas from all processe, and an impregnable fortresse against all the assaults of our ghost∣ly and bodily enemies; and can you then blame the Apostle for making so much of the knowledge of Jesus which is also Christ? Christ, that is, anointed, a blessed and tender hearted Physitian, pro∣fessing his manner of curing in his name, which is by unction, not by usti∣on; by salving and plaistering, not burning and lancing.Vulnera nostra non ustione u∣rans sed uncti∣on. To know Christ is to know our King, Priest, and Prophet: For , signifieth a thrice sacred person anointed with oyle above all his brethren, and appointed by God, 1 A Prophet to us, 2 A Priest for us, 3 A King over us. 1 A Prophet to teach us by his Word, 2 A Priest to purge us by his Blood, 3 A King to governe us by his Spirit.
Of Christs propheticall function Moses prophecieth, saying,Deut. 18.15. A Prophet shall the Lord God raise up unto you like unto me, unto him ye shall hearken: his Priesthood God confirmeth to him byPsal. 110.4. oath: his Kingdome the Angell proclaimeth,Luk. 1.32.33. The Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his Father Da∣vid, and hee shall reigne over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his King∣dome there shall bee no end. Priests were anointed, as Aaron by Moses; and Prophets, as Elizeus by Elias; and Kings, as Saul by Samuel. Christ was therefore thrice anointed as King, Priest, and Prophet, yet is hee not three anointeds, but one anointed. And it is not unworthy our observati∣on, that Christs three functions are not onely mystically figured, but also after a sort naturally represented in the oyle wherewith hee was anointed. 1 Oyle maketh a cheerefull countenance, so doth Christ as a Prophet by preaching the glad tidings of the Gospell unto us. 2 Oyle suppleth and cu∣reth wounds, so doth Christ as a Priest the wounds of our conscience, by anointing them with his blood. 3 Oyle hath a predominancy amongst liquors; if you powre wine, water, and oyle into the same vessel, the oyle will bee uppermost; so Christ as a King is above all creatures, and is So∣veraigne over men and Angels. This his Kingly office typically shined in the Myter of Aaron, as his Priesthood was engraven in the Jewels of his breast-plate: as for the third office of our Lord, his propheticall function, it sounded in the golden bels hanging with the pomegranats at the high Priests skirts. By this glympse you may see & know what it is to know Jesus Christ. This Jesus had not bin a Jesus to us if he had not bin Christ, that is, anointed by God, and enabled by his threefold office to accomplish the perfect worke of our redemption: neither could Christ have beene our Christ if hee had not beene crucified to satisfie for our sinnes, and reconcile us to God his Father by his death upon the crosse; therefore the Apostle ad∣deth, and him crucified. Crucified. And so I fall upon my last Note, a Note to bee quavered upon with feare and trembling in the Antheme set for Good-friday; yet it will not be amisse to tune our voice to it at this time. For this is also a Fri∣day, and next unto it, and in sight of it: and wee all know that if there bee many Instruments on a Table, and you strike one string of any one of them, the strings in the other that carry the same note (though untouched) give some sound at the same instant: in like manner all the Fridayes through∣out the yeere, especially those that fall in Lent, ought to sound out some of the Notes of the dolefull song that was pricked on that day, not with a penne, but with a speare, the burden whereof was Christ crucified. Crucified. In this word the Apostle briefly casteth up the totall of Christs sufferings; the particulars whereof were his 1 Feares and sorrowes, 2 Indignities and disgraces, 3 Tortures and torments. His agony and bloody sweat, his betraying and taking, his arraigning and condemning, his stripping and whipping, his mocking and spitting on, his pricking and nailing to the crosse. The crosse had foure parts,
1 An arrectorium, which was the maine tree fastened in the earth and standing upright towards heaven. 2 Scabellum, a planke to which the feete were nayled. 3 Lignum transversum, a crosse piece of wood whereto the hands were nayled. 4 Verticem, the top or place above the head, where the in∣scription was put. To the dimensions of which parts theEph. 3.18. Apostle seemeth to allude in his sacred Mathematickes, that, saith hee, you may bee able to comprehend with all Saints what is the bredth, and length, and depth, and height. The bredth seemeth to have reference to the lignum transversum, the length to the ar∣rectorium, the depth to the scabellum, and height to the vertex of the crosse. Those who are conversant in Jewish antiquities, observe that crucifying succeeded in place of strangling among them; wherein the speciall pro∣vidence of God is to bee marked, that although the Romanes changed the forme of the death, yet they changed not the Tree; hee that was crucifi∣ed as well as hee that was strangled hanged upon a tree, and thereby be∣cameDeut. 21.23. accursed by the law. A circumstance whereof the Apostle maketh a most comfortable use, saying,Gal. 3.13. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us, for it is written, cursed is every one that han∣geth on a tree. The consequents of sinne are three: 1 Shame, 2 Paine, 3 Curse. All these Christ suffered on the crosse for us. 1 Pain, in his being nailed, racked and pierced. 2 Shame, in being placed betweene two theeves, and that naked, on their solemne feast day on which there was a concourse of innumerable people at Hierusalem. 3 The curse, in hanging upon the tree, being fastened thereto with nailes; which is properly crucifixion or cruci∣fying. In summe, to bee crucified is to bee put to a most painefull, ignomini∣ous, and accursed death: first, to bee stript starke naked, stretched upon a gibbet or crosse, there to have foure nayles driven into the most tender and sinewy parts of the body, then to bee set up and exposed to open shame, to bee a spectacle of misery to the world, to Angels, and to men, and so to hang upon his owne wounds with continuall increase of torments, till either extremity of famine hath exhausted the vitall spirits, or extremity of paine hath rended and evaporated the substance of the heart into sighes and groanes. All this the Sonne of God suffered for us, and yet this is not all: For wee must not thinke that Christs hands and feete were onely cru∣cified, which yet alone were fastened to the crosse; his eyes were after a sort crucified when hee beheld the Disciple whom hee loved, together with his deerest Mother weeping out her eyes under him: his eares were crucified when he heard those blasphemous words, others hee hath saved,
himselfe hee cannot save; if hee be the Sonne of God let him come downe from the crosse: his smell was crucified with the stench of Golgotha: his taste with gall and vinegar; and last of all, and most of all, his heart was cruci∣fied with foure considerations, that entred deeper into his soule than the nayles and speare into his body. These were, 1 The obstinacy and impenitency of the Jewes. 2 The utter destruction of Hierusalem and the Temple. 3 The guilt of the sinnes of the whole world. 4 The full wrath of his Father. For Christ charged himselfe with the sinnes of all the Elect, and there∣fore his Father layd a most heavie burden of punishment upon him: so hea∣vie that in bearing it he sweat blood; so heavie that hee complaines in pite∣ous manner,Mat. 26.38. my soule is heavy unto death; yea and seemes to buckle under it, crying out,Mat. 27.46. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee? All this Christ suffered for us, and yet this is not all, for,Cyprian. de patientia. qui adoratur in coelis non∣dum vindicatur in terra, hee that is adored in heaven is not yet fully revenged upon earth. Revenged said I? nay hee is still wronged, hee continually suffereth in his members, and after a sort in himselfe by the contemners of the Gospell, mis-believers, and scandalous livers. Because the crosse is the trophee of Christs victory over sinne, death, and hell, Satan hath a dead∣ly spite at it, and as hee hath done heretofore, so hee doth at this day em∣ploy all his agents to demolish and deface it; namely, by 1 Jewes, 2 Gentiles, 3 Papists, 4 Separatists, or Non-conformitants: all foure enemies to the crosse of Christ. 1 The Jewes make it a stumbling blocke. 2 The Gentiles a laughing stocke. 3 The Papists an Idoll. 4 The Separatists a scarre-crow. 1 To the Jewes it is an offence. 2 To the Gentiles foolishnesse. 3 To the Papists superstition. 4 To the Separatists and Precifians an abomination. As it was the manner of the Spartanes in the worship of Diana, to whip naughty boyes before her altars, so I hold it an act of piety and charity to scourge these foure sorts of men before the crosse of Christ in my text; and first the Jew, who maketh a stumbling blocke of the crosse. Use 1. cont. Jud.O unbelieving Jew, why dost thou stumble at that which is the chiefe stay of an humble and faithfull soule? is it because the crosse of Christ ca∣steth an aspersion of innocent blood spilt by thy ancestors? Repent for
their sinne and thine owne, and by faith dippe thine hand in this his blood; it hath this wonderfull vertue, that it cleanseth even those hands that were imbrued in it. He is quickned, saith Saint Cyprian, by the blood of Christ, even who a little before spilt Christs blood. Is it because thy glorious fancy of the temporall throne of thy so long expected Messiah cannot stand with the ignominious crosse of Christ? reprove this thy folly, and convince this thine errour out of the mouth of thine owne Prophets which have beene since the world began. Ought notDan 9.26. Messiah to bee slayne after sixty two weekes? ought not Christ to suffer such things, and so to enter into his glory? what is written of him, and how readest thou in thy noble Prophet of the royall race?Esa. 53.8. & 5. He was cut off out of the land of the living, for the trans∣gressions of my people was he stricken. He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes wee are healed: therefore was Barabbas acquitted, and Jesus condemned to the scourge and the crosse. Againe,ver. 12. hee powred his soule unto death, and hee was numbred with the transgressors: therefore Je∣sus was executed with two malefactors, the one on the right hand, the o∣ther on the left. Againe, hee bare the sinne of many, and made intercessi∣on for the transgressors: therefore Jesus when they crucified him, said,Luk. 23.34. Father forgive them, for they know not what they doe. How readest thou in Moses law?Deut. 21.23. cursed is he that hangeth on a tree: therefore Jesus who became a curse for us, hung on the tree of the crosse. Againe, all things by the law are purged by sprinkling of blood with a bunch of Hyssope: therefore Jesus blood wasJoh. 19.29. shed upon the crosse, and a bunch of Hyssope there offered unto him. How readest thou in the booke of Psalmes?Psal. 22.21. they gave me gall to eate, and when I was thirsty they gave mee vinegar to drinke: therefore Jesus said on the crosse, I thirst, and they filled a spunge full of vi∣negar, and put it on a reede and gave him to drinke. Againe,Psal. 22.18. they parted my garments among them, saith David Christ his type, and on my vesture did they cast lots: therefore after JesusMat. 27.35. gave up the Ghost, the souldiers parted his garments, and cast lots. Christ was fastened to the wood of the crosse asGen. 22.9. Isaak was bound to the faggot. Behold the type accomplished, and the scripture fulfilled, heeEsa. 53.10. made his soule an offering for sinne, be not faithlesse but believe. Christ was lift upNum. 21.9. upon the crosse, as the brazen serpent was set up upon a pole for a signe. Behold the type accomplished, and the scrip∣ture fulfilled,Zach. 12.10. they shall looke upon him whom they have pierced, be not faith∣lesse but believe. Christs flesh was torne, bruised, pierced, and as it were, broached on the crosse, as the paschall Lambe, yet without any bone broken. Behold the type accomplished, and the scripture fulfilled,Psal. 22.16. they pierced my hands and feet, and thouPsal. 34.20. keepest all my bones, so that not one of them is bro∣ken. Be not faithlesse but believe, sith every circumstance of Christs pas∣sion is a substantiall proofe, every indignity offered unto him is an Axiome, every nayle and thorne a poignant argument, every marke and scarre in his flesh a demonstration à signo, and his extension on the crosse a declaration and ostension, that hee is the true Messiah. The Jew hath his payment; I now take the Gentile to taske,Vs. 2 Contr. Graec. & Genti∣les. who ma∣keth a laughing stocke of the crosse. O foolish Greeke, why dost thou e∣steeme the doctrine of the crosse foolishnesse, in which all the treasures of
wisedome and knowledge are hid? The Abderites tooke Democritus for a man besides himselfe; but Hypocrates that great Physician made them know that they were out of their wits, not the Philosopher. The folly, O Greeke, is in thy judgment, not in the doctrine of the crosse; the shadow is in thine eye, or the dust in thy spectacle, and not in the object: for hadst thou a single eye, and a cleare spectacle, thou mightst see the crosse beset with foure Jewels; 1 Wisedome in the height and top. 2 Humility in the depth and basis. 3 Obedience on the right side. 4 Patience on the left. Thou mightest see by God his infinite wisedome light drawne out of dark∣nesse, and good out of evill, and order out of confusion. Thou mightest observe in it infinite justice and mercy reconciled: thou mightest admire glory conquered by shame, power overcome by weakenesse, wisedome confounded by folly, death killed by dying, the grave destroyed by being buryed in it, and hell by descending into it. Yea, but thy pride will not brooke to have any faith in a man crucified, or to hope for salvation from him who could not save himselfe from the accursed tree. Indeed if he had beene inforced thus to die, if he had not laid downe his life of his owne ac∣cord, and made his soule an offering for sinne, thy objection had something in it considerable: but sith he dyed by power and not of infirmity; (for though to dye simply be of infirmity, yet so to dye, to lay downe his life at his own pleasure, and take it up again was of power;) sith being in the form of God hePhil. 2.8. humbled himselfe to death, even the death of the Crosse, and in it triumphed over death, hell, and the Divell: stop thy mouth for ever from blaspheming the crosse, or rather open it to the everlasting praise of him that dyed on it; whose misery (if thou beleeve) is thy happinesse, his ignomi∣ny thy glory, his death thy life, his Crosse thy Crown. Thou eternizest the memory of Codrus, Curtius, the Decii, and D. Claudius, for devoting and sacrificing themselves for their Country: how canst thou then but much more love and honour, yea, and adore Jesus Christ, who Codrus-like put on the habit of a common souldier, or rather servant, and dyed in the bat∣taile to gaine us an everlasting victorie over all our enemies: Curtius-like leapt into the Hiatus, or gulfe of death and hell, to save mankinde from it: Decius and Claudius-like, devovit se pro terrarum orbe, gave himselfe up to death for the life of the whole world? And so I let the Greeke passe: the Romanists turne is next, who maketh an Idol of the Crosse.Contra Papist. O superstitious Papist, why dost thou vow pilgrima∣ges, and creepe on all foure to the Crosse? Why dost thou fall downe at it, and often lash thy selfe before it? Why dost thou kisse it, and weepe upon it, and make a woodden prayer to it, saying, Ave lignum, spes unica; all haile thou wood of the Crosse, our onely hope? Was the Crosse crucified for thee? Did thy gilt crucifix die for thee? Hast thou not heard how the Gentiles of old traduced the Christians, quodMinutius Fe∣lix . O. 12 10. Crucis erant religiosi, that they religiously worshipped the Crosse; and what answer the godly Fathers in
those purest times returned unto them, Cruces nec habemus nec optamus, we neither have Crosses nor desire them? Didst thou never heare what S. Helena the renowned mother of great Constantine did when she discovered the true Crosse to which our Lord was nailed, by the inscription? St. Ambrose telleth theeOrat. de obit. Theod. Invenit titulum, Regem adoravit, non utique lignum, quia hic est Gentilis error & vanitas. she espied the title, she adored the King, not the wood verily, for that is a heathenish errour and vanitie; but she worshipped him who hung up∣on the Tree. If the Crosse be a creature, and latrie be divine worship, Crosse latrie which thou practisest, and thy Church teacheth, can be no other than grosse Idolatrie. Me thinkes I heare a new bell ring in my eare, that Papists are not so blockish as to adore the woodden Crosse; this is but a scandall put upon them by some braine-sicke Novellist. They yeeld onely a reverend respect to it as Protestants themselves doe to the Font, to the Chalice, and to the Communion Table, and no more. No more? How then construe they Cardinall Bellarmine his words,L. 2. de imag. sanct. c. 27. Nos omnes cruces adoramus, quia verae crucis ima∣gines sunt. We adore all Crosses, be∣cause all Crosses are images of the true Crosse? How wave theyOrthod. explic. l. 9. Non diffi∣temur nos prae∣clarissimam Christi crucem colere cultu la∣triae. Andradius his open profession, We doe not deny, or make no scruple to confesse that wee worship the most excellent Crosse of Christ with divine worship called Latria? What soder have they for Jonas of Orleans his upbraiding Claudius Tau∣rinensis? or the Roman Inquisitor his branding the Waldenses with heresie, for impeaching the adoration of the Crosse? How can they put by their great schoolemanAquinas p. 1. q. 25. Crux Christi, tum propter reprae∣sentationem Christi, tum propter contra∣ctum membro∣rum ejus, latria adoranda est. Thomas Aquinas his magisteriall decision and reasons; The Crosse of Christ both in regard of the representation of Christ, and be∣cause it touched the members of his body, is to be adored with divine worship? Verily, for this his blasphemous conclusion, and the absurd premisses out of which he infers it, this master of the schooles deserveth to be whipt by his schollers, as the schoolemaster of the Falisci was by the Roman Consul his appointment. For if all those things are to be worshipped with Latria which represent Christ, then all the types of the old law, yea, the brasen serpent it selfe, were to be adored with religious worship; which yet the most religious King Hezekiah brake downe and stamped to powder for that very reason, because the people burnt incense to it, and worshipped it. And if the touch of the members of Christs bodie leaveth such a divine im∣pression in the thing that toucheth them, that presently veneration is due unto it, then most divine and venerable was the dirt of Palaestine which touched Christs feet; and Malcus his eare which touched Christs fin∣ger; yea, and the Asse his backe which touched Christs thigh; and Judas his lips which touched Christs mouth. I have done with the Papist: I come now in the last place to discipline our Disciplinarians, whether meerely precisians,Contra Separatist. & Catharist. or brethren of the conci∣sion; to both whom the symbolicall Crosse in baptisme is such a scarcrow, that they hold aloofe off it; either not comming to our baptisme at all, or if they come, snatching their children out of the hands of the Minister be∣fore he signe them with the Crosse. O supercilious and shallow braine Cartwrightist, or Separatist, why dost thou so much quarrell with an inno∣cent ceremonie used in the christening of Innocents? The Canons of the Church declare that we make it no sacramentall action, but onely a rite of decencie: no object of religious devotion, but a badge of our Christian profession. Hast thou never beene taught in thy catechisme that the signe is
made in the forehead, the seat of shame, to teach, that we ought not to be asha∣med of the Crosse of Christ, but account it the greatest honour to fight under this banner? Hast thou never read or heard with what honourable titles the ancient Fathers have graced this signe, terming it signum fidei, trophaeum fidei, signum Dei, signum Dominicum, signum Christi; the signe of faith, the trophee of faith, the banner of Christ, the ensigne of the Lord? Arme yourCyp epist. 56. foreheads unto all boldnesse, saith holy Cyprian, that the signe of God may be kept safe. If thou sleight the authority of the ancient Fathers, take heed how thou make light of divine apparitions and miracles, related by undoubted Authors,Naz invest. in Jul. Nazianzen,Zon hist l. 5. Zonaras,Mi and de mystcrucis. Picus Mirandula, and o∣thers. When God would foreshew to Julian that his Gospell should pre∣vaile, he did it by a Crosse, environed with a Crowne, which he caused to appeare to him in the entrailes of a beast in the midst of his divining. When he would make it knowne to the Jewes that his Gospell should prevaile against them, who then repaired the Temple of Jerusalem to disgrace it, he did it by cer∣tain signes of Crosses appearing in the builders garments. Last of all, when he would foreshew the renewing of his Gospell by Martin Luther, he did it in anno 1450. by bloudie Crosses, nailes, spunges and speares, which appea∣red in the garments of men and women. What folly, if not impiety, is it then in that English fugitive, andParke, in his booke intiul d, Symbolizing with Papists. Amsterdamian Separatist, to stile this sign of the Crosse a marke of the beast, the cognizance of the harlot of Rome, the character of Antichrist, nay, the dumbe vicar of the Divell; and to in∣dite it of felonie, theft, murder, adulterie, and concupiscence! The signe of the Crosse, though it cannot speake, yet by signes pleads not guilty to them all: for it stayeth not, nor hath any aboad at all, and therefore cannot commit any such foule facts. It is made in the aire, which instantly closeth, and gi∣veth the signe no permanencie to doe or suffer any evill: those accusations therefore lie not against it, but suddenly vanish into aire with the signe it selfe. Yea, but say our Nonconformitants, we have other reall objections a∣gainst the signe of the Crosse, which cannot be blowne away as these aëri∣all with a blast of wind. For we will bring good proofe, that this ceremo∣nie in baptisme was first devised, and the signe of the Crosse taken up by the Valentinian Heretiques, and since it hath beene horribly abused by su∣perstitious Papists; packe therefore it must suddenly away with the rest of Popish trumperie. Festia lentè, soft and faire. 1 Were the signe of the Crosse at the first made and brought into the Church by the Valentinians, it will not follow that presently we must cast it out after them. For though we are forbid to give that which isMatth. 7.6. holy to dogs, yet we are not forbid to take that which is holy from dogs: we may not cast pearle before Swine, yet we may take a pearle from a Swines snout, as Lapidaries doe a precious stone out of the head of a Toad, or as the Pro∣phet Elias did, savory meat from the impure bill of a Raven. 2 We absolutely deny that Heretiques either first made this signe, or introduced it into baptisme. For though it be most confidently affirmed by Cartwright, Parker, and other Authors of schisme amongst us, that the signe of the Crosse was first devised or cryed up by the Heretiques above named; yet Irenaeus, whom they alledge for it, saith no such thing: he spea∣keth
not a word in the places quoted by them of the signe of the Crosse, but of the name of the Crosse; nor of Christs Crosse, but of Valentinus his God Aeons Crosse. All that he hath in his declaration against those Here∣tiques touching this point, is, that Valentinus the Heretique called one of his fantasticall Aeons by two names,  and , that is, bound or defi∣nition, and Crosse. Now if we may not use the signe of the Crosse, be∣cause that Heretique called his feigned God Crosse, by the like reason we may not make definitions in Logicke, nor keepe bounds in our fields, be∣cause he called his Aeon Horon, that is, bound or definition. Had the Va∣lentinians used the signe of the Crosse as they did the name, yet that is no sufficient proofe that they devised this signe, or brought it first into the Church. It is certaine that this signe was by many Aeons, that is, ages an∣cienter than Valentinus his Aeons, or his heresie. We find some print of it inDial. cum Tryph. Jud. Justine Martyr his Dialogue against Tryphon: Nazianzen and other Fa∣thers note an expression of it in Josuah's fight with Amaleck: Sozomen shew∣eth solid characters thereof in the Temple of Serapis: in the ruines where∣of, amongst other Hieroglyphickes, the Crosse was taken up; at the sight whereof many of the Egyptians were astonished, and partly induced there∣by to embrace the Christian faith. The first is therefore a limping obje∣ction, and the second halteth downe-right. It was this, Papists have horribly abused the signe of the Crosse, ergo we may not use it. To argue in such sort from the abuse to the taking away of all use of a thing, is an abuse of argu∣ing, and a meere non sequitur, asRhet. l. 1. c. 1. Aristotle teacheth; for there is nothing in the world that may not be abused save vertue. What creature of God hath not beene abused by Gentiles to Idolatrie? What ordinance of God is not at this day abused by Papists to superstition? be it the Church, or Communion Table, the Pulpit, nay the Scriptures and Sacraments themselves. The Papists abuse lights in the Church, must wee there∣fore sit at Evensong in the darke? They abuse Frankincense, offering it to their Images; may not wee therefore use it in a dampish roome? They abuse Godfathers and Godmothers, to make a new affinity hindering marriage in such parties; will they therefore christen their children with∣out witnesss? Excreate sodes; Papists abuse spittle, mingling it with chrisme, and putting it in the mouth of the childe when they baptize it; will they therefore never spit? It is not the Valentinians first use, or the Papists abuse, or any thing in the Crosse it selfe, savouring of su∣perstition; but a crosse humour in themselves which stirreth them up to cavill at, and alwayes quarrell with the warrantable and decent rites and commendable constitutions of their Mother the Church of England; to whose censure I leave them, and come to our selves. Suffer, I beseech you, a little affliction of the eare, it is a time of penance. You have heard of Jesus Christ and him crucified many wayes;Contra prof. vit. in the gar∣den before his death, on the crosse at his death, and since his death also by the persecutors of the Church, and scandalous livers in the Church, and foure professed enemies of his crosse:
1 Jewes. 2 Gentiles. 3 Separatists. 4 Papists. And shall wee fill up the number, and adde more affliction and vexation to him by our unkindnesse and ingratitude, and neglect of his word, and pro∣phane abuse of his sacraments? shall wee that are Gospellers, by our re∣proachfull lives put Christ to open shame, and crucifie the Lord of life again? shall wee whom hee hath bought so deerely, loved so entirely, provided for so plentifully, and preserved so miraculously, returne him evill for good; nay, so much evill for so much good? hee hath fed us with the fi∣nest wheat flower, and the purest juice of the grape, shall wee in requitall of∣fer him gall and vinegar by our gluttony and drunkennesse, feasting and revelling, even this holy time set apart for the commemoration of Christs passion, and our most serious meditation thereupon? shall wee spit upon Christ by our blasphemous oathes and scoffes at his word and ministers? shall wee put a worse indignity and disgrace upon his members than the Jewes or Romanes did, by making them the members of an harlot? shall wee strip Christ starke naked by our sacriledge? sell him by simony? racke him by oppression? teare him in pieces by sects in the Church, and facti∣ons in the state? Hom. Id. 1. Hoc Ithacus velit, & magno mercentur Achivi. It is that our enemies would spare for no gold to buy it at any rate, that whilest the shepheards are at strife they might send in their wolves to make havocke of the flocke, Eras. adg.Pastores odia exercent, lupus intrat ovile. If any here present at the hearing of these things shall bee pricked in heart,Act. 2.37. as the Jewes were at * Saint Peters Sermon upon this subject, and shall demand of mee, as they did of him and the rest of the Apostles, quid faciemus? what shall wee doe? I answer in his words,ver. 38. repent and be bap∣tised every one of you (not in the first which is already past) but in the second baptisme, which is of teares;Psal. 4.4. stand in awe and sin no more, commune with your owne heart in your chamber and bee still, crucifie the world, and the pompes, the flesh and the lusts thereof, breake off your sinnes by righteous∣nesse, and your iniquities by almes to the poore, humble your soules by wat∣ching and praying, fasting and mourning. Prostrate your selves before Jesus Christ, and him crucified, and after you have bathed your eyes in bri∣nish teares, and anointed them with the eye-salve of the spirit, looke up with unspeakable comfort on your Saviour hanging on the crosse, stretching out
his armes to embrace you, bowing downe his head as it were to kisse you, be∣hold in his pierced hands, and feet, and side, holes to hide you from the wrath of God, behold nayles to fasten the hand-writing against you, being cancelled, to his crosse; behold vinegar to search and cleanse all your wounds, behold water, and blood, and hyssope to purge your consciences, and lastly, a spunge to wipe out all your debts out of his Fathers tables. Which the Father of mercy, and God of all consolation grant, at the suite, and for the merit of Jesus Christ and him crucified: to whom with the Father, and blessed Spirit bee rendered all glory, praise, and thanksgiving now and for ever, Amen.
THE TREE OF LIFE SPRINGING OUT OF THE GRAVE: OR Primitiae Sepulchri. A Spitall Sermon preached on Munday in Easter weeke, April 22. THE THIRTEENTH SERMON. 1 COR. 15.20. But now Christ is risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. Right Honourable, &c. Plin. in panegyr. Aegyptus glori∣ata est se nihil imbribus coelo∣que debere. Siquidem pro∣prio semper amne perfusa, tantis segetibus induebatur, ut cum feracissi∣mis terris quasi nunquam ces∣sura certaret.PLiny the younger writeth of Egypt, that she was wont to boast how shee owed nothing to the clouds, or any for∣reine streames for her fertility, being abundantly wate∣red by the sole inundation of her owne river Nylus. A like or greater priviledge (it must bee confessed) this renow∣ned City hath for a long time enjoyed, in that she hath not beene indebted to any wandering clouds; nor needeth shee to fetch the water of life from any forreine river, or neighbour spring, being richly stored by the overflowing industry and learning of her most able and paine∣full Preachers within her selfe; filling not onely the lesser cisternes of private congregations, but the greater also of these most celebrious and solemne assemblies. And for mine owne part, so let the life blasts of the spirit refresh me in the sweat of my holy labours, and the dew of heavenly
benediction fall upon your religious eares, as I never sought this place, nor am come hither to make ostentation of any so much as conceived gifts in mee, nor to broach any new opinions of mine, or any other, nor to set before you any forbidden fruit though never so sweet, and to a well con∣ditioned stomacke wholesome; nor to smooth or levell the uneven wayes of any, who plow in the Lords field with an oxe and an asse, much lesse to gaine vulgar applause, or spring an hidden veyne of unknowne contributi∣on, by traducing the publicke proceedings in the State or Church; but onely in obedience to the call of lawfull authority, to build you in your most holy faith, and elevate your devotion to the due celebration of this high feast of our Lords resurrection; and by crying as loud as I am able to awake those that sleepe in sinfull security, that they may stand up from the dead, and Christ may give them and us all light of knowledge, joy, and comfort. Which that I may bee enabled to performe, I humbly entreat the concurrence of your patience, with your prayers to God for his assi∣stance in opening the scripture now read in your eares. But now Christ is risen, &c. This is no sterill or barren text, you heare of fruits in it; and although the harvest thereof hath beene reaped by many Labourers before mee, yet there remaine good gleanings for mee also, and those that shall leaze after me, even till the Angels shall thrust their sickle into the large field of the ripe world, and reape the reapers them∣selves. The fruit is of two sorts: 1 Christs prerogative. 2 The deceased Saints priviledge, who in their degree participate with him. Hee is above them, yet with them; hee is the first-fruits, and they are the rest of the heape: andRom. 11.16. if the first fruits bee holy, the whole heape is holy. The ground which beareth this fruit,Occasio & scopus. is the doctrine of the resurrection from the dead, which the Apostle like a provident husbandman first fen∣ceth and maketh sure, and after breaketh and layeth it downe. Hee fenceth it from the beginning of this chapter to the 35. verse, by invincible argu∣ments confirming the truth of the resurrection: afterwards, to the end of the chapter he layeth it downe, by apt and lively similitudes declaring the manner thereof. And this hee doth with much vehemency and contention of arguments, his zeale being kindled through blasts of contradiction by some in the Church of Corinth, who directly denyed the former, verse 12. and ob∣liquely carped at the latter, verse 35. Neither did these alone at Corinth (as much as in them lay) subvert this maine article of our faith,2 Tim. 2.18. but Hyme∣neus and Philetus, with others at Ephesus perverted the sense of it, saying that the resurrection was past already. Whence I first observe against Bellarmine, Parsons, and other Papists, that the Divell tyed not himselfe (as they have surmized) to any rule of method,ex occas. in laying his batteries against the articles of the Creed in order. For the resurrection of the flesh is the last article save one, yet hereticall impiety (as you have heard) first ventured on it. Howbeit the Cardinal, that he might
more conveniently tye all whom hee supposeth Heretickes in one chaine, and thrust us into the lowest place,Bellar. orat. ha∣bit in Gymnas. Ro anno 1576. Hmanigeneris ostis, eitotus alioqui perver∣sus & ordinis perturbator esse soleat, tamen non sine aliquo ordine catholi∣cae ecclesiae ve∣ritatem oppug∣nate volt, &c. beareth his Reader in hand, that the enemy of mankinde, albeit in other things hee bee a disturber of order, yet in impeaching the Apostles creed hath kept a kind of order. 1 For within 200. yeeres after Christ hee assaulted the first article, concerning God the Father almighty maker of heaven and earth, by the Simonians, Menandri∣ans, Basilidians, Valentinians, Marcionites, Manichees, and severall kinde of Gnostickes. 2 After 200. yeeres hee set upon the second article, concerning the di∣vine nature of Christ by the Praxeans, Noetians, Sabellians, and Samose∣tanians. 3 In the next age he opposed the divine person of our Saviour, by the Photineans, Arrians, and Eunomians. 4 From 400. to 800. he impugned the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and se∣venth, concerning the incarnation, passion, resurrection, ascension of our Lord, and his comming to judgement, by the Nestorians, Theodorians, Eutychians, Acephali, Sergians, and Paulians. 5 From the yeere 800. to 1000. hee bid battell to the eighth article, concerning the holy Ghost, by the schisme and heresie of the Graecians. 6 Lastly, from the 1000. yeere to this present age hee hath oppugned the ninth and tenth articles, concerning the catholicke Church and remission of sinnes, by the Berengarians, Petrobrusians, Waldenses, Albigenses, Wicklefists, Hussites, Lutherans, Zuinglians, Confessionists, Hugonites, and Anabaptists. Refut.Were these calculations exact, and observations true, the Cardinall de∣served to bee made Master of ceremonies amongst heretickes, for so well ranking them. But upon examination of particulars it will appeare, that his skill in history is no better than his divinity. To begin where hee en∣deth. First, hee most falsly and wrongfully chargeth the worthy standard-bearers of the reformed religion before Luther, with the impeaching the ninth and tenth articles of the creede. They impeach neither of them, nor any other; nay, they will sooner part with the best limbe of their body, than any article of their creede: whereas on the contrary side, the Roma∣nists, as they impeach the article of Christs incarnation of the Virgin Ma∣ry, by teaching that his flesh is made daily by the Priests in the Masse; not of her blood, but of bread; and of his ascension, and sitting at the right hand of the Father, till hee come to judge the quicke and the dead, by tea∣ching that his body is at once in a Million of places on earth, even where∣soever Masses are said: so they most manifestly overthrow the articles he instanceth in, viz. 1 The ninth & tenth. The ninth by turning  into , univer∣sall into particular, and empaling the whole Church within the jurisdiction of Rome, as the Donatists did of old within the Provinces of Africa. The tenth by branding them with the markes of heretickes who believe the remission of their owne sinnes by speciall faith. 2 As the Cardinall is foulely mistaken in the point of divinity, so also in the matter of history both of former ages, and this present wherein wee live. For who knoweth not that other articles besides the ninth and tenth,
are at this day oppugned by the Servetians, Antitrinitarians, Sosinians, Vorstians, Anabaptists, Libertines, and Familists, whose heresies strike at the soveraigne attributes of God, the Trinity of persons, deity of Christ, his incarnation, satisfaction, second comming, and life everlasting? 3 Neither were these two articles (instanced in) first impugned in our age, or since the 1000. yeere, as hee accounteth; but long before in the third and fourth ages, by the Novatians, Donatists, Luciferians, Me∣letians, and Pelagians. 4 Neither was Sathan so long in setting heretickes on worke to under∣mine all the articles of the creede. If you peruse the bedroll of heresies in Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Philastrius, and Augustine, you shall finde that within the space of 400. yeeres the Divell so bestirred himselfe, that hee left no article of the Apostles creede untouched by them. 5 And lastly, neither had the enemy of mankinde any care at all of or∣der in employing heretickes to overthrow our christian beliefe, more than an enraged enemy, all set upon spoile in demolishing an house, thinketh of pulling downe every stone in order; for to what end serveth order when nothing but present confusion is sought? Therefore against the rule of me∣thod set downe by Bellarmine, Sathan in the second age called in question the last article of the creed, by Papius, and the Millenaries. In the third age hee called in question the eighth article concerning the holy Ghost, by the Macedonians and Pneumatomachi. In the first age hee called in question the second article concerning the divinity of Christ, by the Ebionites and Cerinthians: as also the eleventh by the Ephesians, and those Corinthians whom the Apostle taketh to taske in this chapter, and confuteth in my text. My second observation from the occasion, is, that some heresies, as namely this of the Corinthians concerning the resurrection, against which the Apostle bendeth all his forces, have beene very auncient, and some he∣retickes contemporaries to the Apostles. As God is stiled Dan. 7.13. (that is, Auncient of dayes, or rather Auncient to dayes, as God speaketh of himselfe,Esa. 43.13. Before the day was I am:) so the Divell is called , the old Serpent; whose spawne are all heresies, as well old as new. No truth at the first delivery thereof could bee auncient, nor can any er∣rour after it hath long passed from hand to hand, bee new. Time is with∣out the essence of those things that are measured by it; and consequently cannot make that which is in it selfe evill, good; nor that which is good, evill. Antiquity can no more prescribe for falshood, than novelty preju∣dice the truth. Bare antiquity therefore is but a weake plea in matter of reli∣gion (Tertul. de Vol. Virg. quodcunque contra veritatem sapit haeresis est, etiam vetus consuetu∣do) whatsoever savoureth not of truth, or is against it, is heresie, yea although it be ancient, and plead custome. 1 It was the Samaritans plea against the Jewes,Joh. 4.20.22. Our Father worshipped in this mount, &c. But it was rejected by our Saviour, saying, you worship you know not what. 2 It was the plea of the hereticks called Aquarii against the Catholicks, but disproved by SaintEp. 74. Consuetudo si∣ne veritate est vetustas rro∣ris. Cyprian, saying, Custome without truth is no better than inveterate errour. 3 It was the plea of Guitmundus against the practice of the Romane
Church in Gregory the great his dayes, but disparaged by him, saying, cu∣stome ought to give place to truth and right:Grat. dist. 8. for Christ said not, Ego sum consuetudo, I am custome or prescription, but, Ego sum veritas, I am truth. Nay, it was the very plea of the Paynims against the Christians, and long agoe disabled by the ancient Fathers, Saint Ignatius, Arnobius, Ambrose, and Augustine. Ignatius thus puts it by, Some say they will not believe the truth of the Gospell, if wee produce not ancient records for it; to whom my answer is,Ignat. epist ad Philad. . Christ is my antiquity, his words are to mee in stead, or as good as all ancient records.Arnob. l. 2. cont. gent. Quod ve∣rum est seum non est, &c. Arnobius gravely determines the point, the authority, saith he, of Religion is to be weighed, not by time, but by the divine author there∣of; that which is true is not to be traduced as late or too new. SaintAmb. l. 3. ep. 30 Reprobatis messem quia se∣ra est foecun∣ditas, &c. Ambrose seconds Arnobius, saying to the heathen, doe you finde fault with our Chri∣stian religion, because it is later than your heathenish superstition? you may by the same reason picke a quarrell with harvest, because it comes not till the end of summer, and with the vintage because it falls late in the yeere, and with the olive because hee beareth fruit after other trees. Lastly, SaintQuaest. vet. & novi Test. Qua∣si antiquitas praejudicet ve∣ritati, hic est mos diaboli∣cus ut per anti∣quitatis tradu∣cem commen∣detur fallacia. Austine returnes them a smart answer for this absurd plea, They say that that re∣ligion which is elder cannot bee false, as if antiquity or custome could doe the truth any prejudice at all; 'tis a divellish custome to vent falshood under the title of antiquity. Whereunto may be added, that in propriety of speech that is not antiquity which is so esteemed: the age wherein wee live is in∣deed the eldest, because nearest to the end of the world; and those times which wee reverence as elder, are by so much the younger by how much they were neerer to the beginning of the world, and the birth of time it selfe. The Catholike Christian Church was never so ancient as now shee is. For she was made so at Christs death, cum è terra sublatus fuero, omnes ad me traham: like Eve shee was formed out of the second Adams side, whence issued the two Christian Sacraments, the water of baptisme, and the blood of the holy Eucharist. At the first she was fed with the sincere milke of the word in the Apostles time, came to her perfect growth, strength, and full dimensions in the Fathers dayes, when shee valiantly en∣countred all persecutors abroad, and heretickes at home. After 600. yeeres she began apparently to breake, and in every latter age decayed more and more, and now in most parts of the Christian world (except onely where by reformation her age is renewed) shee is become decrepit, dimme in the sight of heavenly things, deafe in the hearing Gods word, stiffe in the knees of true devotion, disfigured in the face of order, weake in the sinewes of faith, cold in the heart of love, and stouping (after the manner of bowed old age) to graven Images. Wherefore it may bee doubted that Cardinal Bellarmine was , participated somewhat of the infirmities of old age in his bookes of the notes of the Church, where hee would haveBell. de not. Eccles. l. 4 c. 5. Secunda nota est antiquitas. antiquity to be a proper marke of the true Church. He might as well have assigned old age to bee the proper note of a man, which neither agreeth to all men, nor to man alone, nor to any man at all times: no more doth anti∣quity to the Church. What neede I adde any more, sith the truth himselfe hath dashed through this marke againe and againe? Matth. 5.21.27.31.33.38.43. teaching us that the essayes of the auncients are not the touch-stone of truth, but his , I say, you have heard that it was said by them of
old time, &c. But I say unto you, &c. Yea, but say our adversaries of Rome, Christ himselfe elsewhere argueth from antiquity: both affirmatively,Mat. 19.4. He which made them at the beginning, made them male and female; and negatively,ver. 8. From the beginning it was not so. And Saint John also,1 Joh. 2.7. This is the message which ye heard from the begin∣ning. AndTertul. contra Prax. Id vertum quod prius, id adulterinum quod posterius. Tertullian, That is true which is first, that is counterfeit which is latter. And SaintEpist. ad Pomp. Nonne ad fon∣tem recurritur? &c. Cyprian, saying, If the pipe which before yeelded water abundantly faile suddenly, doe we not runne to the spring? And the coun∣cell of Calcedon crying with one voice, , let the auncient rites and customes prevaile: and before them the Prophet Jeremy,Jer. 6.16. aske for the old paths, and walke therein. All which allegations make strongly for the prime and originall antiqui∣ty, not for any of later standing. The old pathes which the Prophet Je∣remy speaketh of, are the pathes of Gods commandements laid downe by Moses and the Prophets; there wee are to aske where is the good way, and to walke in it, not because it is the old way, but because it is the good way. For there are old wayes which are not good wayes, which God forbids us to walke in:Ezek. 20.18. Walke not in the statutes of your Fathers, nor observe their judgements; AndPsal. 49.19. David forewarnes us of, He shall follow the generation of his Fathers, and shall never see light. A fit poesie to be written upon the doore of every obstinate recusant among us. The councell of Calcedon cry∣eth up ancient customes and ordinances, and so doe wee, such as are descen∣ded from the Apostles, or at least are not repugnant to their doctrine, and practice. Saint Cyprians advice is good, If water faile in the pipe or conduit, or runne muddily, to have recourse to the spring; but what spring doth he there point unto? fontem dominicae traditionis, the fountaine of the Lords tra∣dition, that is, the scriptures. Tertullians observation is true, 'Tis good coyne that's first stampt, and afterward that which is counterfeited: the husbandman first sowed good seed, and then the envious man sowed tares. Let the Romanists prove their Trent doctrine to be Dominica, and to have in it the Kings stampe, wee will admit it for currant. After Christ and his Apostles had sowne the good seede, which wee yet retaine pure in our re∣formed Churches, they by their additions have sowne upon it tares. Saint John draweth an argument from the beginning of the preaching of the Gospell; and Christ from the beginning, that is, the first promulgation of the law in Paradise. Let the Romanists fetch an argument from antiquity so high, and we will soone joine issue with them. And to this antiquity we might strictly tye our adversaries, as Saint Cy∣prian doth his opposites.Cyp. ep. 3. Non debemus at∣tendere quid a∣liquis ante nos faciendum pu∣taverit, sed quid qui ante omnes est Chri∣stus. Wee must not respect, saith hee, what any hath done before us (in the matter about which wee contend) but what Christ did which was before all. When they pleaded ancient tradition, hee demandsEpist. ad Pomp. Unde est ista traditio? utrum∣ne de dominicâ & evangelicâ autoritate de∣scendens? &c. si in evangelio praecipitur, aut in apostolo∣rum epistolis, aut actibus continetur, ob∣servetur haec sancta traditio. whence is that tradition? is it derived from the Gospel, or Acts of the Apo∣stles, or their Epistles? then let such a holy tradition bee religiously kept. And Saint AugustineAug. contra lit. Petil. l. 3. c. 6. standeth at this ward against the Donatists: whether concerning Christ, or concerning his Church, or concerning any thing that per∣taineth to our faith and life, wee will not say, if we, but as he going forward addeth, if an Angel from heaven shall preach unto you but what you have re∣ceived
in the Scriptures of the Law and Gospell, let him bee accursed. Yet wee give them a larger scope, even till the beginning of the seventh age, wherein Mahumetanisme began to spread in the East, and Antichristianisme in the West. For the first sixe hundred yeeres they cannot finde any King∣dome, Commonwealth, Country, Province, City, Village, or Hamlet under the cope of heaven professing their present Trent Faith. Wherefore as Phasis, while hee was highly extolling the Emperours proclamation for placing men of quality in the Theater according to their ranke, was by that very edict thrust out of the place hee had got there by Lectius the Mar∣shall: Mart. epig. l. 5. Edictum domini dei{que} nostri Quo subsellia certiora fiunt Et puros eques ordines recepit Dum laudat modo Phasis in theatro, Phasis purpureis ruber lacernis, &c. Illas purpureas & arrogantes Jussit surgere Lectius lacernas. So if the plea of antiquity should simply bee admitted in point of faith, our adversaries undoubtedly would bee cast by it. For although they father bastard-treatises upon ancient writers, and by an unnaturall and prodigi∣ous generation beget Fathers at their pleasure: yet they are not able to produce any Record, expresse and direct testimony, canon of Councell, or Ecclesiasticall constitution, 1 For their burning lights in the Church at noone day, before the de∣cree of PopePlatin. in Sa∣bin.

Thus by occasion of the occasion of my text, the old heresie sprang up in Corinth, against the eleventh article of our creede, I have cast a bone or two to those of the Synagogue of Rome to gnaw upon, who usually creepe in∣to these great assemblies to catch at our doctrine, and snarle at Gods Mi∣nister: and now I wholly addresse my selfe to give the children of the Church their bread, made of the first fruits in my text. But now. The verse immedately going before is to this in hand as a darke foyle to a bright & precious stone, and thus it setteth it off. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, then we Apostles, the chiefe labourers in the Lords harvest, are but as weeds, nay, no better than the world esteemes us, that is, very dung, and the off-scowring of all things. But now through hope in Christs resurrection, & by vertue thereof we are as fruits, yea ho∣ly fruits sanctified in the first fruits, which is Christ. If there be no resurre∣ction from the dead, all our hope is dead and withered at the root, all our preaching false, your faith vaine, your justification void, the dead in Christ utterly lost. But now that Christ is risen from the dead, and so risen, that hee is be∣come the first fruits of all that sleepe in him, our hope is revived, our prea∣ching justified, your faith confirmed, your remission ratified, the dead but onely fallen asleepe, and our condition most desirable. For the grea∣ter persecution we suffer for Christs sake, the greater reward wee shall receive from him; the heavier our crosse is on earth, the weightier shall our crowne bee in heaven.
But the , or (but) is remarkable; for it turneth the streame of the Apo∣stles discourse towards Paradise, which before, like Jordan, was running apace into mare mortuum. If no resurrection, wee of all men most mi∣serable, But because there is a resurrection, wee most happy. The skie is darkest immediately before the breake of day; such was the face of the Church before the rising of the sunne of righteousnesse. All the starres save one were overcast, or rather darkened: InAlart 3. q. ult. . Turr. l. 1. de eccles. memory whereof the Church of Rome on Easter Eeve puts out all the lights save one, to signifie that faith then remained onely in the blessed virgin; in all other, as well Apo∣stles as Disciples, it was eclipsed for the time. The life of their hope dyed with their Master, and all the hope of their life was buried in his grave. Which when they saw guarded, and a great stone rowled to the mouth of it, their hearts were as cold as a stone. But in the proper season of this now in my text, the Angel removed that stone from the sepulchre (and this from their heart) and sitting upon that, made it (as Chrysologus speaketh) a chaire of celestiall doctrine, and out of it preached the first part of my text, Christ is risen from the dead, upon which the Apostle paraphrasing, saith, is become the first fruits of them that slept: Christ is risen from the dead, there is the let∣ter of our Creed, and is become the first fruits of them that slept, there is, as it were, the flourishing about it, or if musicall termes sound sweeter in your eares, here is 1 Planus cantus, or the ground, Christ. 2 Discantus, or the division, is become the first fruits of them that slept. The notes in the descant must answer those in the planus cantus, so they doe here: The first fruits to Christ: Is become to is risen: Them that slept to the dead. The ditty hath three parts or sentences: 1 The doctrine of resurrection is certaine, for Christ is risen. 2 The prerogative of Christ is singular, is become the first fruits. 3 The condition of the dead is happy, they are them that slept, and rest now from their labours. Now seemeth here to have more of the Conjunction than of the Ad∣verbe, and to bee rather a particle of connexion, than a note of time. For Christ was not newly risen when Saint Paul wrote this Epistle, but many yeeres before. The proper and precise (Now) of Christs resurrection, when hee might have beene said to bee now or new risen, was the third day after his passion, being the first day of the weeke. Whence I observe the a∣greement of the time with the truth, not in substance onely, but in circum∣stance also. The types were the Paschall Lambe, and the first fruits. Now as Christ our passover was slayne the very day in which the Paschall Lambe was to bee killed, so hee being also the first fruits (ver. 23.) rose a∣gaine the very day in which the first fruits were by the law to bee offered.
SaintBern serm. in domin. Pasch. Bernard a little varieth the note, yet maketh good harmony. On the sixth day on which hee made man hee redeemed him; the next day, being the Jewish sabbath, hee kept his sabbath rest in the grave; the third day, which was the first of the weeke-dayes, he appeared, The first fruits of them that slept. Of which day I neede say no more to kindle your devo∣tions, and stirre up your religious affections, thanSerm. de resur. Maximus Taurinensis hath long ago in his meditations piously ejaculated. A blessed day, first dis∣covering unto us the light, not of this world but of the world to come; farre happier than that day in which man first saw the light of the sunne. For on that day man was made to travell, on this day to rest; on that day hee was sentenced to death, on this day freed from feare of death; on that day the sunne arose up∣on the just and unjust, this day the sunne of righteousnesse rose onely upon the just; (illius diei splendor etiam sepulchra illuminat) that day shined only up∣on the living, this also upon the dead, as it is written, Awake thou that slee∣pest, and stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. Christ,l. 4. divin. instit. Lactantius interpreteth the King, Unctus nomen est imperii, a∣nointed is the name of soveraigne majesty. SaintTract. 2. in Jo∣han. Christus sa∣cramenti no∣men est, quo∣modo si dicatur sacerdos. Austine expoundeth it a Priest, others a Prophet; for Prophets were also anointed. Saint Bernard alluding to this name, maketh Christ a tender Chirurgian, curing our wounds, non ustione sed unctione, not by lancing or searing, but by anoin∣ting and plastering. The Heathen in Tertullians time expounded it,Tertul in apo∣loget. bo∣num & benignum, good and bountifull, & ne sic quidem malè, and not a∣misse, saith hee, if wee regard the sense and application of that attribute to our Saviour. For  is indeed  kinde, and gracious, and profitable to man, becausePhil. 1.21. in life and death advantage: but amisse if wee respect the derivation. For Christ is derived from  ungo, and answereth to the Hebrew Messias, of , signifying to anoint, and peculiarly it designeth the Sonne of God and Saviour of the world. For albeit others were anoin∣ted besides Christ, and called the Lords anointed, yet Christ alone was  the Christ: 1 . In verity. 2 . After a singular manner. 1 In verity or truth: for all Kings & Priests that were anointed before him were but types of him, and that in part, how holy soever they were; hee is the onely true Christ anointed and appointed by God to save lost man. 2 , According to excellency, or after a singular manner, he is the Christ: 1 Others were anointed by men, he immediatly by God.Psal. 45.7. God even thy God hath anointed thee. 2 They with a lesse measure of graces, he with a greater, incomparably greater, with oyle of gladnesse above thy fellowes. 3 They to beare one office, or two at the most, he to beare three. Melchi∣sedech was a King and a Priest, but no Prophet: Samuel a Prophet and a Priest, but no King: David a King and a Prophet, but no Priest: Christ was all three, a Priestly King, as Melchisedeck, a Kingly Prophet, as Da∣vid, and a Propheticall Priest, as Samuel. I conceive the Apostle here made choice of this name Christ above others, because it best fitted his pur∣pose, and implyed some cause of his resurrection. For as anointing or em∣balming
dead corpses keeps them from putrefying; so Christ by the divine unction was preserved from corrupting in the grave: because there was no corruption in his soule, his body could not corrupt, or at least God would not suffer it, as the Prophet speaketh,Psal. 16.10. thou wilt not suffer thy holy One to see cor∣ruption. Now if his body must not bee left, nor corrupt in the grave, be∣cause it wasAct. 2.24. impossible for him to be held with the sorrowes of death, he must undoubtedly have risen againe, as it followeth: Is risen. In the originall it is  raysed (viz.) by the right hand of his Father; elsewhere  hee is risen of himselfe: neither is there yet any con∣tradiction. For the Father and the Sonne are one in nature, and consequent∣ly the power of the Father who is God, is the power of the Sonne, who is one God with him. Id resurgit quod prius cecidit, that is properly said to bee raised, or rise againe, which before fell, and that is the body, which is therefore called in Hebrew  from  in Greeke , in latine cadaver a cado. Christs resurrection then, or resuscitation from the dead, must bee the enliving his dead corps, and lifting it up, and bringing it up out of the darke sepulchre into the light, which is a kinde of second birth, and not unlike to his first. For as that was his proceeding out of the Virgins wombe; so this was out of a Virgin tombe; the difference was onely in this, asPetrus Chryso∣log. serm. pasch. de resur. ser. 14. Chrysolo∣gus acutely hath observed, the wombe of the virgin conceived Christ quicke, and accordingly brought him forth alive; the wombe of the earth conceived him dead, but brought him forth quicke: uteri nova forma concepit mortuum, parit vivum. As we may behold the feature of a mans face either in the countenance it selfe, or in a glasse set before it, or in a picture drawne by it: so wee may contemplate the resurrection, either in the prophecies and types of the old law, as in glasses, or in the hystory of the new, as it were in the face it selfe, or in our spirituall resurrection from dead workes, as in the picture. A glasse sheweth the lineaments and proportion of a man, but at a distance; so wee may see Christ in the predictions, visions, and figures of the Old Testa∣ment, as so many glasses, but at a distance, according to the words of that Seer,Num. 24.17. I shall see him, but not neare. So Hosea saw him insulting over death and hell, and menacing them;Hos. 13.14. O death I will bee thy death: so Esay saw him risen from the dead, and speaking to him sayd,Es. 26.19. Thy dead shall live, with my body shall they rise: awake and sing ye that sit in dust. So David in the Spirit saw the day of the resurrection, and exceedingly rejoiced at it, saying,Psal. 16.9. my heart was glad, my glory rejoyced, my flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my soule in hell, nor suffer thy holy One to see corruption. So Adam saw him conquering death, and triumphing over him that had the power of death, to wit, the Divell (though more obscure∣ly, because at the farthest distance) in the promise,Gen. 3.15. it shall breake thy head, and thou shalt breake his heele, the death and resurrection of Christ are mystically involved. As the Poets fabled that Achilles after his Mother Thetis held him by the heele, and dipt the rest of his body into the sea, could bee hurt in no part but his heele: so in a divine sense it may bee said of our Saviour, that hee could be wounded by Sathan no where but in his heele, that is, in the lowest part of his humane nature, his flesh. This
the serpent stung at his death, but in his resurrection hee bruised the head thereof. The Devill, saithGreg. Nyssen. de resurrect. ser. 1. . Nyssen, in his sermon upon the resurrection, going about to catch, was caught; for catching at the bait of Christs flesh, hee was caught fast himselfe, and wounded by the hooke of his divine nature. Besides these predictions and promises, wee have in the Old Testament the figure of our Lords resurrection in Adam, a type in the scape goat, a signe or embleme in Jonas, and a vision in Ezekiel. The figure may bee thus ex∣pounded, As Adam rose out of his dead sleepe in which Eve was formed out of his ribbe; so Christ after his slumber of death on the crosse, in which his spouse the Church was formed out of his side (as hath beene said) awoke againe. The type may bee thus exemplified: as the scape∣goate came neere to death, being within the cast of a lot to it, and yet avoi∣ding it, was presented alive to God to make an attonement; so Christ who see∣med to have beene conquered by death, and swallowed up of the grave, lying there three dayes and three nights, yet escaped it, and was presented on Easter day to his Father alive, to make an attonement for all his bre∣thren. To the embleme of Jonas Christ himselfe giveth the word or Mot∣to:Mat. 12.40. As Jonas was three dayes and three nights in the whales belly, so shall the sonne of man be three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth. Af∣ter three dayes Jonas came out of the bowels of the whale, Christ out of the heart of the earth. The vision of Ezekiel is so cleare, that he that run∣neth may see in it a praeludium of the resurrection. Ezek 37.7, 8, 9, 10. The Prophet saw in a valley a number of dry bones moving one to the o∣ther; and suddenly they were tyed with sinewes, and covered with flesh, and the winde breathed into them the breath of life, and they stood up like an army. Wee have viewed the resurrection in the prophecies and figures of the Old Testament, as so many severall glasses: let us now contemplate it in the history of the New, as it were in the face it selfe. 1 Early in the morning, while it was yet darke, the Angel removed the stone, that so Mary and the Apostles might looke into the sepulchre: and unlesse the angell of the covenant remove the stone from our hearts, wee can never looke into Christs sepulchre with an eye of faith, nor undoubtedly beleeve the resurrection. 2 Peter and John made hast to the sepulchre, but they stayed not there; Mary abideth there, shee therefore seeth a vision of Angels, the one stan∣ding at the head, the other at the feet where Jesus had lyen: either to signi∣fie that the Angels of God attend as well on Christs feet, the lowest mem∣bers of his mysticall body, as on his head, that is, the chiefest in the Church: or that the angels smell a sweet savour from our workes of charity, and therefore the one sate at the head, the other at the feete where Mary had an∣nointed our Lord. 3 A third Angell, whereof mention is made in the Gospell of SaintMar. 16.5. Marke, sitting on the right side appeared like a young man, to signifie that in the resurrection our age shall bee renewed, and our bodies shall bee in their full strenghth and vigor: his rayment shined like lightning, to represent the clarity and splendour of our bodies, that after death shall be made confor∣mable to Christs glorious body. 4 Mary Magdalene hath the honour first to see our Saviour, and to bee
the first Preacher of the resurrection, to the everlasting comfort of all true Penitents: and as by the woman death came first, so the first newes of life from death was brought by a woman. 5 Till Christ called Mary by name shee knew him not, but supposed him to have beene the Gardiner (who indeed is the Planter of the celestiall Paradise:) neither can we know Christ, till by a speciall and particular vo∣cation hee make himselfe knowne to us. 6 Christ appeared first to single witnesses, as Mary apart, and Peter apart, and James apart; then to double, Cleophas and that other disciple; after∣wards to the eleven Apostles; and last of all to more than 500. brethren at once. If Maries testimony might bee excepted at because shee was but a woman, what can they say to Saint Peter? what to Saint James, to whom Christ vouchsafed to shew himselfe in particular? If they except a∣gainst them as single witnesses, what will they say to Cleophas and Saint Luke, two contests of one and the selfe same apparition? If their paucity be cavelled at, what will they say to the eleven Apostles? or to more than five hundred brethren that saw him all at one time? nay, what to more than five millions of Confessors and Martyrs, signing the truth of it with their blood, and shewing the power of it as well by the wonders which they wrought in his name, as the invincible patience wherewith they en∣dured all sorts of torments, and death it selfe for his name? I might pro∣duce the testimony of Josephus the learned Jew, and tell you of Paschasi∣nus his holy Well, that fils of his owne accord every Easter day; and the annuall rising of certaine bodies of Martyrs in the sands of Egypt, and like∣wise of a Phoenix in the dayes of Tyberius, much about the time of our Lords resurrection, rising out of her owne ashes. Lactant. in Poem.Ipsa sibi proles suus & pater & suus haeres, Nutrix ipsa sui, semper alumna sibi Ipsa quidem, sed non eadem, quia & ipsa, nec ipsa Eternam vitam mortis adepta bono. But because the authours of these relations and observations are not be∣yond exception, I will rather conclude this point with an argument of SaintDe civit. Dei l. 22. c. 5. Haec duo incredibi∣lia, scil. resur∣rectionem no∣stri corporis, & rem am incre∣dibilem mun∣dum esse credi∣turum, idem dominus ante∣quam vel unum horū fieret, am∣bo futura esse praedixit, unum duorum incre∣dibilium jam factum vide∣mus, ut quod e∣rat incredibile credeet mun∣dus, curid quod reli∣quum est de∣speratur? Austines, to which our owne undoubted experience gives much strength. The same Spirit of God, saith hee, which foretold the resurrection of Christ, foretold also that the doctrine thereof should bee publickly professed and believed in the world; and the one was altogether as unlikely as the other. But the latter wee see in all ages since Christs death, and at this day accom∣plished in the celebration of this feast; why then should any man doubt of the former? The Apostles saw the head living, but not the mysticall body the Catholike Church of all places and ages. We have read in the histories of all ages since Christ, and at this day see the Catholike Church spread o∣ver the whole face of the earth, which is Christs body, how can wee then but believe the head to bee living which conveigheth life to all the mem∣bers? I have set before you the glasse of the resurrection in the figures of predictions of the Old Testament, and the face it selfe in the histo∣ry of the New: may it please you now to cast a glance of your eye upon the Image or picture thereof, in our rising from the death of sinne to the life
of grace. All Christs actions and passions, as they are meritorious for us, so they are some way exemplary unto us: and as none can bee assured of the benefit of Christs birth unlesse hee bee borne againe by water and the Spirit, nor of his death unlesse hee bee dead to sinne, nor of his buriall unlesse hee have buried his old Adam; so neither of his resurrection unlesse hee bee risen from dead workes, and continually walketh in newnesse of life. See you how the materiall colours in a glasse window, when the sun-beames passe through it, produce the like colours, but lesse materiall (and there∣fore called by the Philosophers intentionales & spiritales) on the next wall? no otherwise doth the corporall resurrection of Christ produce in all true believers a representation thereof in their spirituall, which Saint John callethApoc. 20.5. the first resurrection: Saint Paul,Heb. 6.1. repentance from dead workes. Sinnes, especially heinous and grievous, proceeding from an evill habit, are called dead workes, and such sinners dead men, because they are deprived of the life of God, have no sense of true Religion, they see not Gods workes, they heare not his Word, they savour not the things of God, they feele no pricke of conscience, they breath not out holy prayers to God, nor move towards heaven in their desires, but lye rotting in their owne filthinesse and corruption. The causes which moved the Jewes so much to abhorre dead corpses, ought to be more prevalent with us carefully to shunne and avoid those that are spiritually dead in sinnes and transgressions: they were foure; 1 Pollution. 2 Horrour. 3 Stench. 4 Haunting with evill spirits. 1 Pollution. That which touched a dead corpse was by the law uncleane; neither can any come nigh these men, much lesse embrace them in their bo∣some, without morall pollution, and taking infection in their soules from them. 2 Horrour. Nothing so ghastly as the sight of a dead corpse, the repre∣sentation whereof oft-times in the Theater appalleth not onely the specta∣tours but also the actours: and yet this sight is not so dreadfull to the car∣nall man, as the sight of those that are spiritually dead (I speake of foule, notorious, and scandalous offenders) to them that feare God. Saint John would not stay in the same bath with Cerinthus; and certainely 'tis a most fearefull thing to bee under the same roofe with blasphemous heretickes, and profane persons who have no feare of God before their eyes. 3 Stench. The smell of a carkasse is not so offensive to the nostrils, as the stench of gluttony, drunkennesse, and uncleannesse, in which wicked men wallow, is loathsome to God and all good men. 4 Haunting with evil spirits. We read in scriptures that the men that were possest of the divel cameMat. 8.28. out of the tombs and graves: and we find by dayly experience the like of these, rather carkasses than men, that the devill hanke∣reth about them, and entereth into their heart, as he did into Judas, filling them with all wickednesse and uncleannesse. After they have exhausted
their bodies with incontinency, their estate with riotous living; and have lost, first their conscience, and after their credit, they fall into the deepest melancholy, upon which Sathan works, and puts them into desperate cour∣ses.Psal. 73.19. O how suddenly doe they consume, perish, and come to a fearefull end! Me thinkes I heare some say, wee heard of places haunted by evill spirits in time of popery, are there now any such? not such as then were, solitary houses, ruined pallaces or Churches, in which fearefull noyses are said to have beene heard, and walking spirits to have beene met. For at the thun∣der of the Gospell Sathan fell like lightning from heaven, and hath left those his old holds; but places of a contrary condition, such where is the greatest concourse of people, I meane profane Theaters, disorderly Ta∣vernes, Ale-houses, places of gaming and lewdnesse, yea prisons also which were intended for the restraint of wickednesse, and punishment of vice, are made refuges of Malefactors, and schooles of all impiety and wickednesse: Quis custodes custodiet ipsos? As in the hot sands of Africa, where wilde beasts of divers sorts meet to drinke, strange monsters are begotten, which gave occasion to that pro∣verbe,Eras. Adag. Semper Africa aliquid apportat novi, &c. so in the places of moist meetings monstrous sinnes are begotten, monstrous oaths, monstrous blas∣phemies, monstrous murders, monstrous uncleannesse; here Popery is fa∣miliarly broacht, nay Atheisme freely vented, Gods creatures abused, his Sabbath profaned, the actions of the State censured, the watchfull Magi∣gistrates, and the zealous Ministers of the Gospell, and all that make pro∣fession of Religion nick-named, jeared, and made a parable of reproach: here prophane Musicke and impure Songs are played and sung, even in time of divine Service; here's no difference of dayes holy or common, nay no difference of day or night, I had almost sayd nay nor of Sexes. If the hands of the religious Magistrates be not strengthened, and their zeale stir∣red up to take some course to abate the incredible number, and reforme the unsufferable abuses of these sinks of all impurity, especially about the skirts and suburbs of the city, we have cause to feare a worse fire than that which lately affrighted us, falling in that place where it might bee as a dreadfull beacon to warne both City, Borough, and Suburbs; I meane such a fire as fell upon Sodome and Gomorrha.Caus. in Poly∣hist. symb. Polycritus writeth of a Lake of trou∣bled water in Sicily, quam si quis ingrediatur in latum extenditur, into which the deeper a man wadeth the larger it doth extend it selfe. Such a lake my discourse is fallen into, the water is foule and troubled, and the deeper I sinke into it, the more it enlargeth it selfe: and lest it should over∣flow the bankes of the allotted time, I will suddenly leape out of it into my second part, which is Christs prerogative, whereby he is become the first fruits of them that slept. Wee have surveyed the ground, let us now take a sample of the fruits; in the spreading whereof abroad I must handle two things: 1 The reference. 2 The inference.
1 The reference is to Leviticus 23.10. When you reape the harvest, you shall bring in a sheafe of the first fruits of the harvest unto the Priest (ver. 7.) and he shall wave it. And to Exod. 34.22. You shall observe the feast of weeks, the feast of the first fruits of wheat harvest. Now let us set the truth to the type. As the first fruits were reapt in the harvest, when the corne was ripe, so Christ was cut off by death in his ripe age. 2 As the sheafe that was offered was shaken before; so there was anMat. 28.2. earthquake at Christs lifting out of the grave. 3 As the sheafe was offered, the morrow after the Sabbath; so Christ the first day of the week after the Sabbath was presented alive to his Father at his resurrection. Lastly, as there was a distance of time between the first fruits which were offered on Easter day, & those that were offered at the day of Pentecost; so there is a distance of time between Christs rising from the dead, which was 1600. yeers ago, & ours which shall be at the last day. Thus much for the reference; now to the inference, which is twofold: 1 Christs prerogative, in that he is the first fruits. 2 The Saints communion with him, in that they are of the heape. 1 Christs prerogative,Joh. 3.31. Hee that is in heaven is above all, forMat. 28.18. to him is given all power in heaven and earth, andPhil. 2.9. a name above all names,Eph. 1.22. he is the head of the Church, andEph. 5.23. Saviour of the body, he is the firstHeb. 1 6. begotten of the Father,Mat. 1.25. first borne of his Mother, the firstCol. 1.18. Rev. 1.5. begotten of the dead,Col. 1.15. first borne of every creature. Therefore as Quiros strongly concludes in every order, both of creation and regeneration, of nature and grace, of things vi∣sible and invisible, hee hath the preheminence among all: let him have the precedency in our love and affections, let us not set any thing above him on earth, who hath the first place in heaven. If hee bee the head of men and Angels, let the knees of all in heaven, in earth, & under the earth, bow to him: if hee bee the bright morning starre, let the eye of our faith bee earely up∣on him: if hee beeApoc. 22.16. Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, let him bee first in our thoughts, and last in our memory;Apoc. 1.8. let us begin our prayers in his name, and end them in his merits. . Primâ dicta mihi, summâ dicende Camenâ. If he be the first fruits, Reshith bicorre, the first fruits of the first fruits, let all the sheaves do homage to him, let us sanctifie him in our minds, let us of∣fer him the first fruits of our hearts, the first fruits of our lips, the first fruits of our hands, the first fruits of the earth, the first fruits of our thoughts, the first fruits of our desires, the first fruits of our prayers, the first fruits of our labours, the first fruits of our substance, so will he esteem usJam. 1.18. the first fruits of his creatures, and we shall receive theRom. 8.23. first fruits of the spirit here in our regeneration, and the whole harvest hereafter in our glorification, as our ho∣ly brethren that are fallen asleep, in soule have received already; who rest from their labours, and their workes follow them, and here you may see them. I may say of them as Isaac said of Jacob, Gen. 27. The smell of my
sonne is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed. And behold here as in a corne field,Allude to the Hosp tall children in blew coates. blew flowers intermingled. [Here the Preacher read the Catalogue printed, of all the poore re∣lieved in the Hospitals of the City, which followeth.] Children kept and maintained at this present at the charges of Christs Hospitall, in the said house, in divers places of this city, and suburbs, and with sundry nurses in the country, 905 Which is a farre greater number than hath hitherto beene since the foundation. The names of all which are registred in the books kept in Christs Hospitall, there to bee seene from what parishes, and by what meanes they have beene from time to time admitted. Children put forth apprentices, discharged, and dead this yeere, 69 There hath beene cured this yeere last past at the charges of Saint Bartholomews Hospitall, of souldiers and other diseased peo∣ple, to the number of 832 All which were relieved with money and other necessaries at their departure. Buried this yeere, after much charges in their sicknesse, 121 Remaining under cure at this present, at the charge of the said Hospitall, 262 There hath beene cured this yeere last past at the charges of Saint Thomas Hospitall, of souldiers, and other diseased people, 731 All which were relieved with money and other necessaries at their departure. Buried out of the said Hospitall this yeere, 200 Remaining under cure at this present, 304 There hath beene brought into the Hospitall of Bridewell (for this yeere past) of wandring souldiers, and vagrant persons, to the number of 1578 Of which number many have beene chargeable for the time of their being there; which cannot be avoided by reason of their mi∣sery, nor passed away without charge. There is maintained and kept in the said Hospitall, in arts and occupations, and other workes and labours, Apprentices taken up out of divers parishes and streets of this City, to the number of 200 I have made an end of the Catalogue, but you must not make an end of your good workes: I have set before you a faire copy, you must write af∣ter it, or else this schedule will prove a hand-writing against you at the day of judgement, who have had not onely many most forcible exhortations to good workes in this place, but such noble and royall presidents as you see, and yet have not been bettered by them. You cannot want pitifull ob∣jects of mercy: your pious charity hath daily Oratours, the teares of or∣phans, the sighes of widowes, the groanes of the sicke, and the lamentable cryes of prisoners and captives. Neither is it sufficient for you now and
then to drop upon the dry and thirsty ground, you must stillare pluviam li∣beralissimam, you must powre downe golden showres to refresh Gods inhe∣ritance. To whom much is given, much shall bee required of him. In other seizements you give as you are in the Kings books; but contrariwise, you are in Gods bookes, and hee valueth you as you give to pious and charitable uses. And let mee intreat you for the love of your Redeemer from everla∣sting thraldome, to open your hands towards the redemption of many hundreds of our countrey-men, whose bodies are in captivity under Turks and Infidels, their wives and children in misery at home, and it is to be fea∣red, their soules in worse case. Next to the redemption of these spirituall Temples of the holy Ghost, I commend unto you the reparation and beautifying of his materiall Temple: you have most decently and beauti∣fully adorned and trimmed the daughters of Zion, the lesser and later built Churches in this City, let not your piety bee lesse to the Mother-Church, dedicated to the most publike and solemne worship of God, where you are fed with the finest flower of wheat, and drinke of the purest juice of the grape, and in the fullest manner partake of the communion of Saints; which was the second inference I made from the attribute of Christ in my text, whereby hee is stiled Primitiae dormientium, The first fruits of them that slept. 2 The second inference from the attribute here mentioned (the first fruits of, &c.) is the communion of the faithfull with Christ, both in sanctificati∣on and glorification; for the further manifestation whereof it will bee re∣quisite to specifie whereof Christ is the first fruits, viz. 1 Coeli, for he is the first begotten of his Father. 2 Uteri, for he was the Virgins first borne. 3 Sepulchri, for hee is the first fruits of them that slept. In all three the faithfull partake with him after a sort. 1 In that hee is Primitiae coeli, the first fruits of heaven. For as hee is the naturall sonne of God, so are wee the adopted sonnes of God, and by his spirit made2 Pet. 1.4. partakers of the divine nature: as hee is the first borne of hea∣ven,Heb. 12.23. so wee are also of the generall assembly and Church of the first borne which are written in heaven. 2 In that he is Primitiae uteri virginei, the first fruits of a virgins womb. For as Christ was borne of a virgin Mother, so the Christian Church our Mother is continually in child-bearing, and yet remaineth still a virgin. 3 Most properly doe wee partake with him in that hee is Primitiae se∣pulchri; for hee isJoh. 12.24. that corne of wheat Saint John speaketh of, which was sowne at his death, digged deepe into the earth at his buriall, sprang up a∣gaine at his resurrection, and now is become the first fruits of them that slept: in like manner wee are sowne at our death, digged deep into the earth at our buriall, and shall spring up againe at the last resurrection, and bee offered asApoc. 14.4. first fruits unto God and the Lambe. Where the first fruits are taken out, there must needs bee a lumpe or heape out of which they are taken.Calvin in hunc locum. In primitiis totius anni proventus consecrabatur, in the first fruits the whole crop of the yeere was hallowed; so in Christ, who is our first fruits, all true
believers are sanctified, as those words of our Saviour in that most divine prayer to his Father recorded import,Joh. 17.19. for their sakes I sanctifie my selfe, that they also might bee sanctified through the truth. If Christ sanctified himselfe for us, shall not wee endeavour as hee ena∣bleth us by his grace, to sanctifie our selves also for him? If hee impart this his dignity to us, and maketh usJam. 1.18. the first fruits of his creatures, let us dedicate our selves unto him: let us bee given to him, as1 Sam. 1.28. Samuel was, all the dayes of our lives. Hee hath chosen us to bee (marke I beseech you what) fruits, not blossomes, not leaves; fruits I say, not stalkes, not emp∣ty eares, like those who make a bare profession of the truth, and all their re∣ligion is in their eares, bearing no fruit at all, or in no degree answerable to their holiest profession. If God hath made us fruits, let us not make our selves ranke weeds by heresie, or filthy dung by a corrupt life. After the first fruits are carried away out of the field, the rest of the shockes or sheafes follow of course;Theod. in hunc locum. primitias universa massa sequitur: Christ the first fruits is carried away long since out of the field of this world, into the celestiall barne. A barne farre more stately, beautifull, and glorious than any Princes pallace upon earth; and when the harvest shall come, which isMat. 13.39. the end of the world, wee shall bee carried thither also every one in his owne order: the first fruits is Christ, after they that are Christs at his com∣ming, ver. 23. Before I can proceed, according to my desire and your expectation, to the period of my discourse, and end of all mens course, viz. death, called here sleepe, I must remove sixe rubbes that lye in my way. For wee read of three dead men raised in the Old Testament, and as many in the New, before Christ himselfe rose: how then is hee the first fruits of them that slept? 1 I will offer to your consideration many solutions of this doubt, that you may take your choice. Saint Jerome gives but a touch at it, yet be∣cause it is upon the right string 'tis worth your hearing: Christus primus surrexit in incorruptione; the rest before they were raised began at least to corrupt; it is sayd of Lazarus expressely, that heJoh. 11.39. stanke, but God suffe∣red not his holy One to see corruption: they rose in their naturall and corrup∣tible bodies, Christ in an incorruptible, and as the Apostle calleth it, a spi∣rituall body, ver 44. 2 That which Cornelius A lapide answereth is considerable, that though Christ were not primus tempore, the first that rose in time, yet that he was primus in intentione Dei, the first in Gods intention. 3 Aquinas comes yet nearer the matter, Christus primus sua virtute re∣surrexit, Christ was the first that rose himselfe by his own power; they be∣fore Christ were raysed by others. If any thing be yet lacking, S. Bernard and Beza will supply it; alii suscitati sunt mortui, sed iterum morituri; other dead were raised, but dyed againe, like drowned men which rise up twice or thrice from under water, but sinke againe to the bottome: Christus simul resurrexit, & aeternam beatam{que} vitam recepit, Christ at once rose, and ob∣tained an eternall and blessed life.Rom. 6.9. Christ being risen from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more power over him. Whereunto  may bee added, that others rose as private men,
Christ as a publike person, and the cause of all other mens rising, either univocall, as of all the Elect, who rise as hee did to happy eternity; or equivocall, as of the reprobates, who are raysed to eternall misery. They who rose before Christ were either singular types of him, or as common sheafes of the heape; Christ was the first that ever rose in the nature and quality of the first fruits, to sanctifie the whole harvest of the dead in him, who are here called, Them that slept. Aristot. lib. de mirabil. auscult.Aristotle writeth of certaine serpents in Mesopotamia, which doe great mischiefe to strangers, but do no hurt at all to the inhabitants: such is death, it hath power to sting those that are strangers and aliens from the common∣wealth of Israel, it hurteth not at all the naturall Israelites, which are fel∣low-citizens with the Saints of the houshold of faith. Those which are with∣out God in the world, and without Christ, though within the visible Church, have cause to feare death; because, like the Phalangium inStrab. l. 2. geog. . Stra∣bo, it stings them to death in such sort, that they dye either laughing or madde; that is, either making a jest of judgement, and hell, and the life to come, or distracted in some fearefull fit of desparation. And as Diogenes when hee felt himselfe falling into a slumber a little before his death, said pleasantly,Eras. apoph. Diog. Frater me mox est traditurus fratri suo; one brother is now delivering mee to the other (hee meant sleep to death:) so it is most true of these scoffers at God and all religion, dying impenitently, that their tem∣porall death delivers them over to eternall death; the elder death to the younger (but longer liver,) the first death to theUbi mors vi∣vit, & finis in∣cipit. Greg. Mo∣rah. in Job. second: but upon those who are in Christ, and have part in the first resurrection, the second death hath no power, and in that regard the first death is not terrible unto them: nay, so farre is it from being terrible, that even lying on their death-beds they insult both upon death and the grave with holy sarcasmes.1 Cor. 15.55. O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory? . Graec. liturg.The immortall entred into a single combate with death on the crosse, and gave death a death wound, even by his death: and now death is no more death to the godly, but a sleep;Mat. 9.24. The damosell is not dead, but asleepe; our friend Lazarus isJoh. 11.12. but asleepe. Stephen though hee came to his end by a violent meanes, yet it is said of him thatAct. 7.60. he fell asleep. And I would not have you ignorant brethren, saith S. Paul, concerning them which are1 Thess. 4.14. asleep: and so in my text, they who before were called the dead, now after the mention of Christs resurrection, are termed, Them that slept. Which words are not so to bee understood, as if their soules slept with their bodies till the day of judgement. That is a drowsie heresie, out of which Calvin shaketh some in his time, whom he calleth by the right nameSoule-all-night-sleepers. Psychopamychistas: but in three other respects, 1 Because they rest from their toylesome labours, as those that sleepe wee say are at their ease. 2 Because they neither minde, nor at all meddle with any affaires of this life either good or bad, as those that are fast asleepe,Hom. Il. 2. , for the time, neither thinke nor often so much as dreame of any thing in the world. 3 Because they shall certainely be awaked by the shrill sound of the last
Trumpet; as those that sleepe at night are awaked againe in the morning by the Weytes your City musicke. Do you believe all these things? I know you do. Why do you then take on in such grievous manner when your friends are taken away from you by corporall death? Why doe you make their death-beds swimme with your teares? non amisistis, sed praemisistis; you have not lost them, but sent them to bed before you: they are but asleepe, they shall awake againe; they are but as seede sowne in the earth, they shall rise out of it againe. Bern. in Cant. Occidit me De∣us cum succidit Gervasium me∣um.I know that where hearts have bin knit together, they cannot be rent asun∣der without exceeding great pain and unexpressible griefe: neither do I find fault with naturall affection; much lesse condemne the Christian compassi∣on of those whoRom. 12.15. weepe with them that weepe. It is for a Stoicke, or rather a stocke, to bee without all sympathy of others sorrow, or sense of his owne losse:Cic. pro dom. ad Pont. eam animi duritiam sicut corporis, quod cum uritur non sentit, stuporem potius quam virtutem puto. Our Lord and Master reads us another lesson, who himselfeJoh. 11.35. wept for Lazarus: and whosoever reades (if yet for teares hee be able) Davids lamentation for Jonathan; Saint Ambroses for Satyrus; Nyssens for Saint Basil; Nazianzens for Gorgonia; Augustines for Nebridius; and Bernards for Gervasius, will finde that the heat of love is contrary to all other. For all other dryeth, but this the greater it is in the heart the moister the eyes are. Yet love must not exceede proportion, nor teares measure;Hieron. in epi∣taph. Paulae. grandis in suos pietas impietas est apud Deum. What Seneca speakes of words, may bee a good rule in these teares, still are volo non currere; let them drop like precious water out of a Lymbecke, not run like common water out of a spout: Horat. carm. l. 2 ed. 20.Absint inani funere naeniae, Luctus{que} turpes, & querimoniae: Compesce clamorem. Demang in Hebrew, signifying a teare, hath great affinity with Dema∣ma, signifying silence, to teach us that our teares ought to bee silent, not querulous or clamorous. Let nature have her course, but let religion set bounds to it. Horat. l. 2. carm ed. 9.Ne semper urge flebilibus modis Mysten ademptum. Let us water our plants, but not drown them, as those that mourne without hope. Joseph loved his Father Jacob better than the Egyptians, yet his teares were but the tithes of theirs; for hee mourned butGen. 50.3. seven dayes, but they seventy. Rachel, though otherwise a good woman, yet in this was too wo∣manish and wayward, that shee would not bee comforted; neither is her rea∣son good nor true, if wee take it as the words sound, because they are not; for wee know they are, and living too, all live to God: wee know where they are that dye in the Lord, with Christ in Paradise; wee know what man∣ner of dwellings they have, tabernacles not made with hands, eternall in the heavens; wee know of what congregation they are, of the congregation of the
first borne, and the spirits of just men made perfect: wee know what they doe, they follow the lambe wheresoever hee goeth; wee know what they say also, they cease not to cry day and night, Holy, holy, holy, &c. lastly, wee know what they sing, Halelujah. Wherefore as Xenophon when newes was brought him (as he was sacrifi∣cing) of his sonnes death, put off the crowne hee had on his head, and gave vent to his sorrowes at his eyes; but after hee understood that hee dyed va∣liantly, and worthy such a Father, put on his crowne againe, and finished his sacrifice: so when newes shall bee brought unto us of the death of our dearest friends, let us first put off our crowne of joy, and let nature and love melt us into teares; but when wee heare againe that they dyed peni∣tently and religiously, with hope full of immortality: let us put on our crowne againe, and comfort ourselves, and finish our Christian course with joy, as those religious people did, of whom Saint Austine speaketh, putting himselfe among them;Aug. ser. 35. de divers. Contristamur in nostrorum mortibus ne∣cessitate amittendi, sed cum spe recipiendi, inde angimur, hinc consolamur, inde infirmitas afficit, hinc fides reficit, inde dolet humana conditio, hinc sa∣nat divina promissio: the consideration of the losse of our friends cutteth us, but the hope of receiving them againe healeth us. And now at the length to release your long captivated attention, I will speake but one word of admonition to you concerning your owne end, and so an end. Is death nothing but a sleep? why then are you so much scared at the mention or thought of it? When the Prophets of God, or some other your deerest friends deale faithfully with you, telling you there is no way but one, and advising you to set your house in order, for you must dye and can∣not live; why doe you fetch many a deep sigh, turne to the wall and mourne like a dove, or chatter like a crane? why doe you not rather struggle with your owne infirmitie, and with resolute Hilarion, even chide out your soules hankering at the doore of your lips: Egredere, quid times? egredere anima mea, quid dubitas? sexaginta prope annis servisti Christo, & mortem times? Goe out my soule, why art thou afraid? goe out, why makest thou any difficulty? thou hast served Christ well nigh sixty yeeres, and dost thou now feare death? You will hardly finde any little childe, much lesse man, that is afraid to goe to bed; nay travellers after a tedious journey in bitter wea∣ther, are not content to pull off their cloathes, they teare them for haste to get into their soft and warme beds: When our day is spent, and wee are come to our journeyes end, why doe we not, as it were, pull off our cloaths, by stripping ourselves of worldly cares and businesses, and settle our selves to sleepe in Jesus, and breathe out our soules betweene his armes? Plato when hee died had the booke of Sophronius the Musitian under his pillow. When we lye on our death bed let us have under our pillow to support us, not the booke of Sophronius the Musitian, but the bookes of the sweet sin∣gers of Israel, David and Salomon, and the rest of the inspired Writers: so shall wee be sure that God will make our beds in our sickenesse, and we shall sweetly fall into our last sleepe, as did the most religious Matron Paula, who when some about her, as shee was now drawing on, read to her the se∣cond of Canticles; so soone as shee heard the Bridegroome calling, Surge speciosa mea, surge columba mea, veni: Arise my Love, arise my Dove, arise
my Faire one, and come away, the winter is past, the raine is over and gone: she answered as it there followeth; the flowers appeare in the earth, the time of pruning, or (as it is in our translation) the time of singing is at hand. With which word shee made an end of her life, and I will of my Sermon; com∣mitting you, as shee did her soule, to God; beseeching him who hath taught us the doctrine of the resurrection by his word, to accomplish it in us by his Spirit, that having part in the grace of the first resurrection here, wee may hereafter participate in the glory of the se∣cond through JESUS CHRIST. Cui, &c.
THE TRUE ZEALOT. A Sermon preached at the Archbishops visitation in Saint Dunstans. THE FOURTEENTH SERMON. JOHN 2.17. The zeale of thine house hath eaten mee up. THe parcell of Scripture whence I have taken my text is a sacred sculpture or Hieroglyphicke, consisting of 1 An embleme or imprese: 2 A motto or word. The embleme presenteth to us the Temple with a kinde of Faire in it; and a man (which is the sonne of man) with a scourge of small cords, dri∣ving out all the buyers and sellers, and powring downe their money, and overthrowing their tables and stalles. The motto, word or sentence, is that which I have already spoken in your hearing, viz. The zeale of thine house hath eaten mee up. The exemplification of the embleme I commend to him, to whom our Saviour hath left his whip to void, & cleanse this tem∣ple, and to discipline all sorts of bad merchants in it. The motto or word be∣longeth properly to them to publish & proclaime it, whose stile is vox cla∣mantium, the voice ofMat. 3.3. cryers; not the sweet voice of singers to lull men a∣sleep in security, with melodious streines of time-serving & eare-pleasing Madrigals and Fancies: but the strong and loud voice of Cryers, to
call all men into the Court, and summon them to the barre of Christs judgement: hee that promiseth his Apostles and their successors to give them aLuk. 21.15. I will give you a mouth, &c. mouth, hath given mee at this time both the mouth and the Motto, the Motto of the embleme, viz. the words of my text, Zelus domus tuae devoravit me. In the uttering whereof if ever, now I need to pray that the Lord wouldEsay 6.7. touch my tongue with a coale from his altar; with a coale, that I may speake warmely of zeale; with a coale from the altar, that I may discourse holily of his Temple. SaintHomil. 3. Uti∣nam daretur mihi de superno altare, non car∣bo unus, sed globus igneus offeratur, qui multam & in∣veteratam ru∣biginem possit excoquere. Bernard made the like prayer upon the like occasion: O, saith hee, that there were given unto mee from the al∣tar above, not one coale, but rather a fiery globe, a heape of coales, to scorch the abuses of the time, and burne out the inveterate rust of vitious customes. By the light of these coales you may behold in this Scripture, 1 In David as the type, Christ, 2 In Christ, as the mirrour of perfection, zeale, 3 In zeale as a fire, 1 The flame, 2 The fuel. The flame, vehement, consuming, or devouring, devoravit. The fuel sacred, me, mee. No divine vertues or graces like to Christs affection: No affection in him like to his zeale: No zeale like to that which hee bare, or rather wherewith hee was transported to his Fathers house, which even eat him up; and may deser∣vedly take up this golden moment of our most pretious time. May it please you therefore, Right, &c. to suffer your religious eares to bee bored at this present with these sacred nayles, or points, which I humbly pray the holy Spirit to fasten in your hearts: 1 The vertue or affection it selfe, zeale. 2 The object of this affection, thy house. 3 The effect of this object, hath eaten up. 4 The subject of this effect, mee. 1 In figure, David. 2 In truth, Christ. ; and who is sufficient for these things? or able wor∣thily to treat of 1 An affection most ardent, zeale. 2 A place most sacred, thine house. 3 An effect most powerfull, hath eaten up. 4 A person most divine, mee? Zeale is derived from  to burne, or hizze, as water cast on metall mel∣ted,
and it signifieth a hot or burning desire, an ardent affection: and some∣times it is taken 1 For , or emulation, which is a commendable desire of attai∣ning unto anothers vertue or fame. 2 For , or , envie, which is a vitious affection, repining at anothers fame or fortune. 3 For  jealousie, which is an irkesome passion arising from love wronged, at least in opinion. And no other fire wee finde on natures forge, or the Philosophers hearth; but on Gods altar there burneth another manner of fire, fed with pure fuell, which like a waxe light or taper, yeel∣deth both a cleare flame and a sweet fume; and this is holy zeale. All things that are cast into the fire make a smell; but the burning of sweet odors one∣ly makes a perfume: so the hot and fervent 1 Desire of, 2 Intention in, 3 Affection to the best things onely, is zeale. Fire is the noblest of all the elements, and seated next to the heavens: so zeale sparkling in the soule is the chiefe and most heavenly of all spirituall affections. Some define it to bee the fervour, intention, excellency, or im∣provement of them all. Heat 1 InRom. 12.11. Ferent in spirit. devotion, if it exceed becommeth zeale. 2 InCol. 4.13. affection, if it be improved groweth to be zeale. 3 In1 Cor. 14.12. desire of spirituall gifts, if it bee ardent is zeale. 4 In1 Cor. 7.11. indignation, or revenge of our selves, if it bee vehe∣ment, is called by the Apostle zeale. Fervent devotion, ardent love, earnest desire, vehement indignation, all are zeale, or rather are all zeale: for there is a 1 Zeale of good things, which maketh us zealous of Gods gifts. 2 Zeale in good things, which maketh us zealous in Gods service. 3 Zeale for good things, which maketh us zealous for Gods glory. And answerable to the three operations of fire, which are, to heat, to burne, to consume: 1 The first heateth us, by kindling a desire of grace. 2 The second burneth, by enflaming our hearts with the love of God. 3 The third consumeth, by drying up the heart, absuming the spirits with griefe, and hazzarding our persons and estates in removing scandals, and reforming abuses and profanations of God his name, house, or worship, as also revenging wrongs done to his houshold and servants. In summe, zeale is a divine grace grounded upon the knowledge of
Gods word, which according to the direction of spirituall wisedome, quickeneth and enflameth all the desires and affections of the soule in the right worship of the true God; and vehemently and constantly stirreth them up to the preserving, advancing, and vindicating his honour by all lawfull meanes within the compasse of our calling. Rectum sui est judex & obliqui: If you set a streight line or rule to a crooked figure or body, it will discover all the obliquities in it. Hang up an artificiall patterne by an un∣skilfull draught, and it will shew all the disproportions and deformities in it. Wherefore Aristotle giveth this for a certaine , or character of a true definition, to notifie and discover all the errors that are, or may be de∣vised about the nature of the thing defined; which are in this present sub∣ject wee treat of, sundry and manifold. For as when there is publicke no∣tice given of a ring found, with a rich stone set in it, every one almost that ever was owner of a ring like unto it, especially if his owne bee lost, chal∣lengeth it for his: so all in whose temper, affections or actions, any natu∣rall or spirituall, divine or diabolicall, heavenly, earthly or hellish fire glow∣eth, challengeth the pretious coale or carbuncle of zeale to bee theirs. The Cholericke and furious, the quarrelsome and contentious, the malicious and envious, the jealous and suspicious, the Idolatrous and superstitious, the in∣discreet and preposterous, the proud selfe-admirer, the sacrilegious Church-robber, the presumptuous and exorbitant zealot, nay the seditious boutefieu and incendiary, all pretend to zeale. But all these claimers and many more besides, are disproved and disclaimed by the true definition of zeale: which is, first, a grace, and that distinct from other; not more graces, or a com∣pound of love and anger, as some teach; or of love and indignation, as others: for the graces of the spirit, and vertues of the minde are incoincident. As where divers candles or torches in a roome concurre to enlighten the place, the light of them remaineth impermixt, as the Optickes demonstrate by their severall shadowes: so all the divine graces conjoyne their lustre and vertue to adorne, and beautifie the inward man; yet their nature remaines distinct, as their speciall effects make it evident to a single and sharp-sigh∣ted eye. God was in the bush that burned and consumed not, yet God was not the bush. The holy Ghost was in the fiery cloven tongues, yet the holy Ghost was not the tongues. The spirits runne along in the arteries with the purer and refined blood, yet the spirits are not the blood. The fire insinua∣teth it selfe into all the parts of melted metall, and to the eye nothing ap∣peareth but a torrent of fire, yet the fire is not the metall: in like manner zeale shineth and flameth in devotion, love, godly jealousie, indignation, and other sanctified desires and affections, it enflameth them as fire doth metall, it stirreth and quickeneth them as the spirits doe the blood, yet zeale is not those passions, neither are all, or any of them zeale; howsoever the schooles, rather out of zeale of knowledge than knowledge of zeale, have determined the contrary. 2 Secondly, zeale is defined to bee, not a morall vertue, but a divine gift or grace of the Spirit: the Spirit of God is the efficient cause, and the Spirit of man is the subject; which the Apostle intimates in that phrase,Rom. 12.11. , being fervent or zealous in Spirit. This fire, like that of the Vestals, is kindled from heaven by the beames of the Sunne of righteous∣nesse,
not from any kitchen on earth, much lesse from hell. They there∣fore qui irae suae stimulum zelum putant, they who imagine the flashes of naturall choler are flames of spirituall zeale, toto coelo errant, are as farre from the marke as heaven is distant from the earth. No naturall or morall temper, much lesse any unnaturall and vitious distemper, can commend us or our best actions to God and men as zeale doth. The fire of zeale like the fire that consumed Solomons sacrifice, commeth downe from heaven; and true zealots are not those Salamanders or Pyrausts that alwayes live in the fire of hatred and contention; but Seraphims, burning with the spirituall fire of divine love, who, as Saint Bernard well noteth, kept their ranke and station in heaven, when the other Angels of Lucifers band, that have their names from light, fell from theirs. Lucifer cecidit, Seraphim stant, to teach us that zeale is a more excellent grace than knowledge, even in An∣gels that excell in both. Howbeit though zeale as farre surpasse know∣ledge as the sunne-beame doth a glow-worme, yet zeale must not be with∣out knowledge. Wherefore God commandeth the Priest when heeExod. 30.8. ligh∣teth the lamps to burne incense: though the fire bee quicke, and the incense sweet, yet God accepteth not of the burning it to him in the darke. The Jewes had a zeale, as theRom. 10.2. Apostle acknowledgeth; and the Apostle him∣selfe before his conversion, yet because it wanted knowledge, it did them and the Church of God great hurt. No man can bee ignorant of the dire∣full effects of blind zeale: when an unskilfull Phaeton takes upon him to drive the chariot of the sunne, hee sets the whole world in a combustion. What a mettled horse is without a bridle, or a hot-spurred rider without an eye, or a ship in a high winde and swelling saile without a rudder, that is zeale without knowledge; which is like the eye in the rider to choose the way, or like the bridle in the hand to moderate the pace, or like the rudder in the ship to steere safely the course thereof. SaintInser. 22. in Cant. Bernard hits full on this point: Discretion without zeale is slow paced, and zeale without dis∣cretion is heady; let therefore zeale spurre on discretion, and discretion reyne zeale; fervor discretionem erigat, & discretio fervorem regat. Discre∣tion must guide zeale, as it is guided by spirituall wisedome, not worldly policy: and therefore Thirdly, I adde in the definition of zeale, that it quickeneth and enfla∣meth all our holy desires and affections according to the direction of spirituall wisdome. For wisdome must prescribe zeale, when, and where, and how far, and in what order to proceede in reforming all abuses in Church and State, and performing all duties of religious piety, and eminent charity. What Isocrates spake sometime of valour or strength, is as true of zeale, viz.Isoc. ad Dem. , &c. that zeale and resolution with wisedome doth much good, but without, it doth much mischiefe to our selves and others; like granadoes and other fire-works, which if they be not well looked to, and ordered when they breake, do more hurt to them that cast them than to the enemie. Yet that we be not deceived in mistaking worldly policy for wisdome, I adde spirituall, to dif∣ference it from carnall, morall, or civill wisedome; for they are too great coolers, they will never let zeale exceed the middle temper of thatVibius.

Ille igitur nun∣quam direxit brachia contra torrentem. never strike a

Such is the worldly wise man, hee will move no stone, though never so needfull to bee removed, if hee apprehend the least feare that any part of the wall will fall upon himselfe. TheCic. de orat. l. 1. Tempus omne post consulatum objecimus iis fluctibus qui per nos à com∣muni peste de∣pulsi in nosmet∣ipsos redunda∣runt. Romane Consul, and incomparable Oratour shall bee no president for him; who imployed all his force and strength to keepe off those waves from the great ves∣sel of the State, which rebounded backe againe, and had neere drowned the cocke-boate of his private fortune. Hee will never ingage himselfe so farre in any hot service, no not though Gods honour and the safety of the Church lye at stake, but that he will be sure to come off without hazzard of his life or estate. Hee hath his conscience in that awe that it shall not cla∣mour against him for not stickling in any businesse that may peradventure reflect upon his state, honour, or security. In a word, peradventure he may bee brought with much adoe to doe something for God, but never to suf∣fer any thing for him. This luke-warme Laodicean disposition, the lesse offensive it is to men, the more odious it is to God, who is a jealous God, and affecteth none but those that are zealous for his glory; he loveth none but those that will bee content to expose themselves to the hatred of all men for his names sake.

No Sa∣crifice is acceptable to God that is not salted with the fire of zeale, which guided by wisedome quickneth and enflameth all the inward desires as well as the outward actions, that appertaine to religion: for the chiefe seat of zeale is the fountaine of heat, and that is the heart; there itPsal. 45.1. bubbled in Da∣vid, there itLuk. 24.32. Did not our hearts burne when hee opened to us, &c. burned in the disciples, itPsal. 22.15. My heart is dried, &c. consumed and dryed up the very substance of the heart in Christ. If our zeale burne not inwardly as well as outwardly, as well upwards towards God, as downewards towards the world; if it enflame not our charity as well as incense our piety; if the heat of it bee cooled by age, or slacked by opposition, or extinguished even by floods of bloody persecution, it is no true Vestall fire, nor such as becom∣meth Gods altar: for that might never, this did never go out; sincerity it selfe is not so opposite to hypocrisie, as zeale. Sincerity without zeale is a true, but a cold and faint-hearted, zeale is an eager, fierce, hot, and couragious ene∣my of all hypocrites, whom shee brandeth with an eternall note of infa∣my. But because all fires are in a manner alike to the eye, how should wee know holy fire from prophane, heavenly from earthly, that is, zeale from enraged hypocrisie; pretending with Jehu, that hee is zealous for the Lord of hostes? I answer, as a precious Diamond is valued, by three things: 1 Inward lustre: 2 Number of caracts: 3 Solidity of substance. and thereby is distinguished both from counterfeit gemmes, and those that are of lesse value: so true zeale is distinguished from hypocriticall by
1 Sincerity, 2 Integrity, 3 Constancy: all which notes are discernable in holyPsal. 119.2. Da∣vids zeale. 1 Sincerity; I have loved thy testimonies with my heart,ver. 6. yea my whole heart. 2 Integrity; I have had respect unto all thy commandements:ver. 34. all false wayes I abhorre. 3 Constancy; I have kept thy lawes unto the end.ver. 44. When the face and hands and outward parts burne, as in a feaver, the heart is so cold that it quaketh and shivereth: so it is with the hypocrite, his tongue alwayes, and his hands too sometimes burne, Persius satyr.—Sed pone in pectore dextram Nil calet.— If you could put your hand into his bowels, you should finde his heart like Nabals, as cold as a stone. True zeale if it bee transported, it is in pri∣vate devotion to God (si insanimus Deo insanimus) in outward carriage to∣wards men it proceeds resolutely indeed and undauntedly, but yet delibe∣rately and discreetly; it burneth within most ardently, it scarce ever fla∣meth or sparkleth outwardly; like those bathes in the Pythecusian Ilands, whereofBalnea in Py∣thecusiis insulis fervent supra modum calore, & vi igneâ, nec tamen flam∣mam emittunt. Vide Aristot. mi∣rabilium auscult. Aristotle writeth, that they are hot above measure, and of a fiery nature, yet send forth no flame. Secondly, as insincerity discries the hypocrite, so also want of integrity. Take the hypocrite that maketh the fairest offer to zeale, though hee out∣strippe some it may bee in some works of piety, and duties of the first Ta∣ble, you shall take him tardy in most acts of charity, and duties of the se∣cond Table. Peradventure he will slay smaller sinnes with the sword of the Spirit, like the meanest of the Amalekites, but hee will spare Agag and the principall, his gainefull sinnes of simony, sacriledge, usury, and oppression; hee is never —Totus teres atque rotundas. Goe he as upright as hee can you shall perceive him to limpe and halt with God, or man, or both. If the point of controversie in the Church no way touch his free-hold, hee takes it no more to heart thanAct. 18.17. Gallio did the up∣roare about Saint Pauls preaching; then difference about articles of faith, are but contentions about words, : but if it rubbe upon his profit or credit with his owne faction, then hee never leaveth crying out, great isAct. 19.28. Diana of the Ephesians. You may finde an hypocrite zealous against Ido∣latry, but you shall finde him very moderate against sacriledge: if he have a moneths minde to Rome he will stickle for the authority of the Church; but the scripture is very cheape to him, hee will deliver prayers by tale to
God, the blessed Virgin and Saints: but for Sermons, hee holds it a kinde of merit to heare few of those of his owne sect, and none of any other. On the contrary, if hee hath beene brought up at the feete of Cartwright or Brown, then he is all for Scriptures, and nothing at all for the Church; all for preaching, and nothing for prayer, unlesse it be an abortive issue of hi owne brain, an extemporary, indigested, incomposed, inconsequent ejaculation, in which he is never out because he is never in. As for the premeditated, pen∣ned, advised, and sanctified forme of Service appointed by the Church, it is to him like the white of an egge that hath no tast in it. But the most certain and infallible character of an hypocrite and his zeale, is the soon cooling and a∣bating thereof, and in the end evaporating into ayre; like a blazing starre he glareth for a time, but in a short space playes least in sight; like fire-works of danke powder, hee never leaves shooting off on these and the like watch-towers whilest his matter lasteth, but when that is spent goeth out in a fume or stench. True beauty beareth off all weathers, but paint is washed off with a shower, or discovered by the fire. Saint Basil's embleme was columna ignea, a fiery pillar; fiery, there's his zeale; a pillar, there's his con∣stancy. I doubt whether nature can present such a stone as the name As∣bestus in the original signifieth, that is, a stone of fire that nothing can ex∣tinguish: but I am sure grace can, and that is this jewell of zeale I have beene so long in describing; for it burneth alwayes in the heart and can ne∣ver be quenched. I would bee loath to be thought to goe about to quench the smoaking flaxe, or discourage any man in whom there is a sparke of this fire covered with ashes; yet I should deceive them, or suffer them to be mis-led with an ignis fatuus, if I should not tell them that if this their zeale like a lampe or candle arise not up in the socket, and make the greatest blaze at the last, it is no true zeale.Nat. hist. l. 37. c. 10. Chryso∣lampis pallidi coloris est in∣terdiu, nocte ignei. l. 2. c. 103. Fons solis circa meridiem maxi∣mè frigidus est, ad noctis medi∣um fervore in∣festatur. Pliny writeth that the Chrysolamp is of a pale colour in the day, but of a fiery in the night: and in like manner hee reporteth of the fountaine of the sunne, springing in the countrey of the Troglodites, that at mid-day it is extreme cold, but extreme hot at mid∣night; and Solinus the like of a Well by Debris. I wish I did not see in these fountains, or the colour of the Chrysolampis, the picture of our nati∣ons zeal. In the dark of ignorance, or mid-night of Popery was not our zeale for Gods truth exceeding hot and fiery? but now in the sunne-shine of the Gospell is it not of a coole temper, like fons solis, the fountaine of the sun, and of a pale colour like the Chrysolamp in the day?Solin. c. 32. Apud Debrim oppidum Gara∣mantum fons est qui die friget, nocte fervet, friget calore, calet frigore. There was a time when like the Galatians the people of this City and Kingdome would have plucked out their very eyes for the Ministers of the Gospell, and have cho∣sen rather to have lost the lights of their body than of their soule: but now many care not how little they see us upon these or the like watch-towers. May not God complaine of our zeale as hee did of the righteous∣nesse of Ephraim, that it is like theHos. 6.4. morning dew, when the sunne groweth hot not a droppe to bee seene on the grasse? It was the reproach of our neighbour nation,Primus impe∣tus plus quam virorum, secun∣dus minor quam foemina∣rum. That in their first assault they were more than men, in the second lesse than women. I pray God we justifie them not in our fight against sin and Satan, and conflicts with temptation, in which we are not so valiant at the first as we are cowardly at the last. May we not daily observe many, who at their first entry into the ministry are so zealous, so frequent,
so diligent in their preaching, that a man durst engage himselfe deepely for them, that they would prove trueVide vit. Juell praefix. oper. Juels, dye standing in the Pulpet: and yet shortly after, great preferments comming upon them, they verifie that Proverbe, leves curae loquuntur, ingentes stupent? Have we not Guardians of our Churches, that in their first yeere present more abuses than a zea∣lous Nehemiah can reforme in seven; yet afterwards when they are made of the Cabin-Councell, and become leaders in our Vestries, and have lear∣ned that Demosthenes received a greater reward for silence than Aeschines for speaking, they erect a Court of Faculties in their owne breast, and dis∣pence with themselves for perjury: videntes vident & non discernunt, & audientes audiunt & non intelligunt; in seeing they see scores, nay hun∣dreds receiving the Communion standing, or sitting at their best ease: they see, especially in the suburbs, not onely on other holy-dayes, but also on the Lords-day, Ale-houses and Tavernes full, and Churches empty: in the City seeing they see but will not discerne many a reverend Paul, and hopefull Timothy forsaken of the better part of their auditory, who runne a gadding after some new schismaticall Lecturer, whose name is up; who resembleth our late and new found Wels, that worke wonders for a Sum∣mer, and multitudes of people flocke to them, but afterwards all their ver∣tue is gone? As in seeing they see these things and discerne them not, so in hearing they heare and understand not: they heare old heresie new varni∣shed, refined popery, yea sometimes direct and grosse, and yet they either doe not, or will not understand it: they heare Popish Priests and Jesuites at their next doore mumbling Masses, and yet understand it not: they heare in the Pulpet our reverend Prelates, most worthy double honour, our zealous Nehemiahs, our Christian Courts, our sacred Canons, our decent Ceremonies jeared at or sighed against in a pang of Amsterdamian zeale, and yet they understand it not. What should I speake of the people in ge∣nerall, who when a Chrysostome first openeth his golden mouth amongst them, throng and croud at the Church doores, and not onely fill all the seates, but climbe into the windowes, and hang upon iron barres, and con∣tribute so freely to his maintenance, that they need to bee restrayned by law, as the Israelites were in Moses time; but after a yeere or two they fol∣lowEras. adag.

So at the first they offer gold in abundance, afterwards they turne their gold into silver, and then their silver into brasse tokens, and last of all these into ayre. As a tem∣porary faith justifieth us not before God, so neither temporary charity be∣fore men; true zeale is not a flash, or a blaze, but a lasting fire that burneth alwayes: it is good, saith SaintGal. 4.18. Paul, to bee zealous in a good matter al∣wayes. By the marks I have now set upon the hypocrite, you may descry him, and sever him from a zealous Christian: & by those which follow in the de∣finition of zeale, Enflaming all the desires and affections in the true worship of the true God, the holy fire of the sanctuary is distinguished from all such strange fire as our Nadabs and Abihu's, superstitious, idolatrous, seditious, or presumptuous zealots offer.
1 The lay Papist is a kinde of zealot; for his zeale eates up his time and his estate too: yet hee is not zealous, because his zeale is not employed and exercised in the true worship of God, according to his word, but accor∣ding to mans will and invention; viz. in praying to Saints, in worshipping images, in suffrages for the dead, in seeing Masses, and adoring the hoste, and telling out a fet number of Pater-nosters, and Ave-Maries upon hal∣lowed beads, in making superstitious vowes, and going in pilgrimage, and abstaining from certaine meates, and wearing haire-cloth, and whipping themselves, and creeping on all foure to a crucifix, and the like: of all which wee demand as God doth of the Jewes by the Prophet Esay,Isa. 1.12. Who hath required these things at your hands? Who requi∣red these things? 2 The idolatrous heathen is a kinde of zealot: for hee is not content to offer beasts onely to God, with the Jew, but men also to their gods. For in some places they sacrifice their children, as among the Moabites: in o∣thers their fathers, as among the Triballi: elsewhere their princes or priests, as among the Indians: and in some countryes themselves, as among the Americans: yet for all this their throwing themselves into, or causing others to passe through the fire to their Moloch, or Saturne, or Abaddon, they are not to bee accounted zealously affected in religion, because what they doe in this kinde, is not done by Gods commandement, nor intended to his honour; but in obedience, and to the honour of an Idoll, or Devill, whom they worship in stead of the true God. 3 The Jesuite, or Jesuited Romanist is a kinde of zealot: for hee will compasse sea and land to make a proselyte, hee will sticke at nothing for the advantage of the catholike cause, no not the sticking or stabbing of Kings and Princes: his zeale is so hot, that it will kindle a fire to blow up whole Parliaments for an Holocaust to the Romane Moloch; yet is hee not zea∣lous, because hee is hot and fervent, not for Christ, but for Antichrist; and hee useth not sanctified, but execrable and damnable meanes to promote the catholike cause (as he termeth it) and enlarge the territories of the Man of sinne. The last condition of true zeale is, that it keepe within the walke of mens speciall calling, which they who confound, for the most part bring confu∣sion upon themselves, as did King Uzziah, who would bee thought out of zeale to burne incense unto the Lord; but because hee tooke upon him to doe that which2 Chron. 26.18. appertained not to him, but to the Priests of the Lord the sonnes of Aaron, that were consecrated thereunto, his incense stanke in the nostrils of God,ver. 19. and himselfe also: for a leprosie rose up in his forehead before the Priests in the house of the Lord, from beside the incense altar; and Azariah the chiefe Priest thrust him out of the Temple,ver. 20. yea himselfe hasted also to goe out, because the Lord had smitten him. Nothing is more necessary or usefull than fire, if it bee kept within the furnace, oven, or tunnell of the chimney, yea or within the barrell of the piece, and from thence orderly issue out; but nothing so dangerous if it bee not contained within the hearth, or breake out of it selfe, and flye abroad: so nothing is more commendable or profitable than well guided, nothing more in∣commodious and perillous than exorbitant zeale; when the Prince medleth with the censer, or the Priest with the scepter: when private men take
the sword out of the Magistrates hand, or the Magistrate mis-applyeth the publike sword of justice to revenge his private wrongs. Thus have I at length defined zeale, and confined it within the limits of every mans lawfull and speciall calling. Which limits shall be the bounds of my speech and your attention at this present. The bestPlin. nat hist. l. 12. c. ult. Op∣timum quod est odoratissimum è semine, ac maximum & ponderosissi∣mum, modens in gustu est, fervens{que} in ore balsamum and most soveraigne, is that which is biting in the taste, and burning in the mouth: such have beene the observations upon this text, biting in the taste, and hot in the mouth. God grant that like true balsamum they may prove a savour of life unto life to all that have heard me this day. I am come with our Saviours Commission, to put fire among you; and what is my desire, but that forthwith it be kindled, to purge out all your drosse, to purifie the sons of Levi likeMal. 3.2. sil∣ver, to burne up all hay and stubble built upon the foundation of our most holy faith, and lastly, to consume all our spirituall sacrifices? But non opis est nostrae, non opus est nostrum; alas it is not my breath will doe it, it must bee the blast of Gods holy Spirit, that can first kindle, and after keepe this sa∣cred fire in the hearth of our hearts. To him therefore who descended in theAct. 2.3. similitude of fiery cloven tongues, let us lift up our hearts, hands, and voi∣ces, beseeching him to tind and preserve this spirituall fire in our 1 Hearts, 2 Eares, 3 Tongues, 4 Hands; that wee may bee zealously affected to Godward, in meditating on him, in hearing from him, in praying to him, in doing and suffering for him. To knit up all in a word, His grace make us sincerely, entirely, discreetly, and constantly zealous, 1 Of his gifts, 2 In his service, 3 For his honour: to whom bee ascribed all ho∣nour, glory, &c.
THE SEASONING OF ALL SPIRITUALL SACRIFICES: OR The Salters Text. A Sermon preached before the Company of the Salters at S. Maries Church in Bread-street. THE FIFTEENTH SERMON. MARKE 9.49. For every one shall bee salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall bee sal∣ted with salt. Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. THat I may not entertaine your religious attention with a cold or unseasonable discourse, I have made choice of a text, wherein I finde both fire and salt; fire to heat it, and salt to season it. And if any parcell of Scripture may be appropriated to any of the Worshipfull Societies or Companies of this Honourable City, certainly you may challenge a peculiar interest in this. For here is both salt and salting (from whence you take your name) both of men & sacrifices. The best of all crea∣tures on earth are men, and the best of all gifts of men are sacrifices, & both are made savory and acceptable to God by seasoning; they with fire, these with salt. In relation to the former, me thinks as Christ said to Andrew and Peter,Matth. 4.19. Follow me & I will make you fishers of men; so I heare the holy spirit
say to mee, Observe this text well and apply it, and I will make thee a sal∣ter of men; for every man must bee salted with fire, and, as it followeth, Eve∣ry sacrifice must bee salted with salt.Lev. 2.13. E∣very oblaion of the meat offering shalt thou season with salt, neither shalt thou suffer the covenant of thy God to bee lacking from thy meat offering. With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt, saith Moses from God: Every sacrifice shall bee salted with salt, saith Christ from Moses; whose drift in this place is somewhat obscure, because the sense is covered under the vaile of an Allegory, which wee cannot draw without looking up higher into the chapter, and touching upon the prece∣dent verses. Wherein our Lord threatneth unquenchable fire, and an im∣mortall worme to all that for want of the fire of zeale grow cold in religion; and for lacke of the salt of grace putrefie in their sins. If, saith he, that per∣son or thing that causes thee to offend, either in want of courage for God, or of zeale and Christian resolution against thy bosome sinnes and naturall corruptions, bee as deare to thee as thine eye, or as necessary as thy right hand, part with them thou must; if it be an eye, plucke it out; if an hand, cut it off, and cast it away from thee; better see thy selfe in heaven with one eye, than to see thy selfe in hell with both; better hoppe into life with one legge, than runne to eternall death with both; better without a right hand to bee set with the sheepe at Gods right hand, than having a right hand to bee set at Gods left hand, and afterwards with both thine hands bee bound to bee cast into hell fire,ver. 44.46.48. where the worme never dyeth, and the fire is not quenched, and againe, and a third time, where the worme never dyeth, and the fire is not quenched. At the mention whereof, it being the burthen of his dolefull Sonnet, our Saviour perceiving the eares of his auditors to tingle, in the words of my text hee yeeldeth a reason of that his so smart and bi∣ting admonition, saying, For every one shall be salted, &c. and withall hee sheweth them a meanes to escape that unquenchable fire which they so much dreaded, and to kill the immortall worme which even now began to bite them. The meanes to escape the one, is to bee salted here with fire; and the meanes to kill the other, is to be salted here with salt; for salt pre∣serveth from that putrefaction which breedeth that worme. He who now is salted with the fire of zeale, or heart-burning sorrow for his sinnes, shall never hereafter bee salted with the fire of hell: this fire will keepe out that, asOvid. Met. l. 2. Saevis compes∣cuit ignibus ig∣nes. Jupiters fire drove out Phaetons: and hee who macerateth here his fleshly members with the salt of Gods uncorrupt word, and the cleansing grace of his spirit, shall never putrefie in his sinnes, nor feele the torment of the never dying worme. The Philosophers make three partitions, as it were, in the soule of man: the first they call the reasonable, or seate of judgement; the second, the i∣rascible, or seat of affections; the third, the concupiscible, or the seat of de∣sires and lusts. In the reasonable part they who knew nothing of the fall of man, and originall corruption, find little amisse; but in the concupiscible they note , something like superfluous moisture inclining to luxury; in the irascible, , or , something like cold or rawnesse enclining to feare: behold in my text a remedy for both; fire for the one, and salt for the other. And that wee may not lose a sparke of this holy fire, or a graine of this salt so soveraigne, let us in a more exact division observe, 1 Two kindes of seasoning:
1 With fire: 2 With salt. 2 Two sorts of things to bee seasoned: 1 Men without limitation, Every: 2 Sacrifices without exception, All. GodGen. 4.4. had respect unto Abel and his sacrifice; first to Abel, and then to his offering: hee accepteth not the man for his sacrifice, but the sacrifice for the mans sake. First therefore of men and their salting with fire; and af∣ter of sacrifices and their salting with salt. Every one shall bee salted with fire. SaintHieron. in hunc locum. Mire di∣ctum est, &c. ille verè victi∣ma domini est, qui corpus & a∣nimam a vitus emundando, Deo per amo∣rem consecra∣tur, nec sale aspergitur, sed igne consu∣mitur, quando non peccati tan∣tum contagio pellitur, sed & praesentis vitae delectatio tolli∣tur, & futurae conversationi totā mente sus∣piratur. Jerome was much taken with this speech of our Saviour: it is, saith he, an admirable saying; That which is seasoned with salt is preserved from corruption of vermine; that which is sal∣ted with fire loseth some of the substance; with both the sacrifices of the old Law were seasoned: such a sacrifice in the Gospell is hee, who cleansing his body and soule from vice, by love consecrateth himselfe to God; who then it not onely sprinkled with salt, but also consumed with fire, when not onely the contagion of sinne is driven away, but also all delight of this present life is ta∣ken away; and wee sigh with our whole soule after our future conversation, which shall bee with God and his Angels in heaven. It is newes to heare of salting of men, especially with fire: an uncouth expression, yet used by our Saviour to strike a deeper impression into the mindes of his hearers: and verily the Metaphor is not so hard and strained, as the duty required is harsh and difficult to our nature. It went much against flesh and blood to heare of plucking out an eye, or cutting off an hand or foot, yet that is nothing in comparison to salting with fire: salt draweth out the corrupt blood, and superfluous moisture out of flesh, but fire taketh away much of the substance thereof, if not all. For the fattest and best parts of all sacrifices were devoured by the flame, of such things as were offered to God by fire. If such a salting bee requisite, wee must then not onely part with an eye, or a hand, or a foot, but even with heart, and head, and whole body to be burned for the testimony of the Gospell; if so the case stand that either we must leave our body behind us, or wee leave Christ. Such a salting is here prescribed by our high Priest, as draweth out not onely corrupt moisture, but consumeth much of the flesh also, yea sometimes all; (that is) not one∣ly bereaveth us of superfluous vanities, and sinfull pleasures, but even of our chiefe comforts of life it selfe, our friends, our estates, our honours, yea sometimes our very bodies. So hot is this fire, so quicke is this salt. Those that are redeemed by Christs blood, must thinke nothing too deare for him who paid so deare for them: rather than forfeit their faith, and renounce the truth, they must willingly lay all at stake for his sake, who pawned not onely his humane body and soule, but after a sort his divine per∣son also, to satisfie the justice of God for us. Every one. How farre this Every one extends, and what this salting with fire signifieth, the best Interpreters, ancient and latter, are not fully agreed.
Some restraine every one to the reprobate only, and by fire understand hell-fire: others to the elect onely, and by fire understand the fire of Gods spi∣rit, or grace, burning out, as it were, and consuming our naturall corrupti∣ons. They who stand for the former interpretation, conceive that Christ in these words yeeldeth a reason why hee said that hell-fire shall never bee quenched;Ver. 48. for every one (that is say they) of the damned in hell shall bee salted with that fire; the fire shall be to their bodies as salt is to flesh, which keepeth it from putrefying. O cruell mercy of hellish flames: O saving destruction: O preservation worse than perdition: O fire eternally de∣vouring, and yet preserving its owne fuell: O punishment bringing con∣tinuall torments to the damned, and continuing their bodies and soules in it! It is worse than death to be kept alive to eternall pains: it is worse than perdition to bee saved for ever in these flames, to bee ever scorched and never consumed, that is, to bee ever dying and never dye. Here, as SaintAug. de civit. Dei, l 13. c. 11. Ibi non erunt homines an∣te mor∣tem, ne{que} post mortem, sed semper in mor∣te, at{que} per hoc nunquam vi∣ventes, nun∣quam mortui, sed sine fine morientes. Austine acutely observeth, wee can never bee sayd properly dying, but either alive or dead; for to the moment of giving up the ghost, wee are alive, and af∣ter that dead; whereas on the contrary, the damned in hell can never bee said to bee alive or dead, but continually dying: not dead, because they have most quicke sense of paine; not alive, because they are in the pangs of the second death. O miserable life where life is continually dying; O more miserable death where death is eternally living! Yea, but shall all be sal∣ted with this fire, the fire of hell? God forbid. Doth Christ say of this salt, not of the earth but of hell, that it is good? (ver. 50.) is this the meaning of his exhortation, have salt in you; that is, procure the salt of hell fire to keep you alive in the torments of eternall death, to preserve you to everlasting perdition? By no meanes.In hunc locum. Maldonat therefore and Barradius, and all that are for this first interpretation are justly to bee blamed, because they had an eye to the antecedents, but not to the consequents of my text. On the other side, those who adhere to the second interpretation are not free from just exception, because they had an eye to the consequents, and not to the antecedents. For wee ought to give such an interpretation of these words as may hold good correspondence both with the antecedents and consequents, and either give light to both, or receive it from them. The elect, to whom these latter restraine the word All, have nothing to doe with the unquenchable fire of hell, mentioned ver. 48. neither have the re∣probate, to whom the former interpreters appropriate these words, any thing to doe with the good salt, ver. 50. yet both have to doe with some kinde of salting, and with some kinde of fire. For every one shall bee salted one way or other, either here with the fire of the spirit seasoning our nature and preserving it from corruption; or hereafter with the fire of hell. There is no meanes to escape the never dying worme of an evill conscience, but by having salt in us, nor to prevent the unquenchable fire of hell, but by fire from heaven, I meane, heart-burning sorrow for our sinnes: Dolor est medicina doloris. That we may not bee hereafter salted with the fire of hell, wee must be here salted with a threefold fire: of
1 The word: 2 The spirit: 3 Affliction, or persecution. First, with the fire of the word: the word is a fire;Jer. 23.29. Is not my word like a fire, saith the Lord? It hath the three properties of fire: 1 To give light: 2 To burne: 3 To search. First, it giveth light; therefore Psal. 119. it is called a lanthorn to our steps, and a light to our paths. Secondly, it burneth, 1 In the eare: 2 In the mouth: 3 In the heart. First, in the eare:1 Sam. 3.11. Whosoever heareth my words, saith God, his eares shall tingle. Secondly it burneth in the mouth,Jerem. 5.14. I will make my words fire in the mouth. Thirdly, it burneth in the heart,Luk. 24.32. Did not our heart burne within us when hee opened to us the scriptures? Lastly, it searcheth, pierceth, and tryeth like fire, TheHeb. 4.12. word of God is mighty in operation, and sharper than a two-edged sword, &c. Secondly, with the fire of the spirit; the spirit is a fire,Act. 1.5. You shall be bap∣tized with the holy Ghost and with fire. Water will wash out filthy spots and blots on the skinne onely; but fire is more powerfull, it will burne out rot∣ten flesh and corrupt matter under the skinne. This fire of the holy Ghost enlightneth the understanding with knowledge, enflameth the will and affe∣ctions with the love of God, and zeale for his glory, and purgeth out all our drossie corruptions. Thirdly, with the fire of persecution and affliction. Persecution is cal∣led a1 Pet. 4.12. fiery tryall; and all kinde of afflictions and temptations, wherewith Gods Saints are tryed, in Saint Austines judgement, are the fire whereof Saint Paul speaketh;1 Cor. 3.15. He shall be saved, as it were through fire. And of a truth, whatsoever the meaning of that text bee, certaine it is that the purest vessels of Gods sanctuary, first in the Heathen, next in the Arrian, and last of all in the Antichristian persecution, have beene purified and made glorious like gold tryed in the fire. There is no torment can bee devised by man or divell whereof experiments have not beene made on the bodies of Christs mar∣tyrs: yet the greater part of them, especially in these later times, have beene offered to God by fire, as the Holocausts under the law. Bloody per∣secutors of Gods Saints, set on fire with hell, of all torments most employ∣ed the fiery, because they are most dreadfull to the eye of the beholders, most painefull to the body of the sufferers, and they leave nothing of the burned martyr, save ashes, which sometimes the adversaries maice out∣lasting the flames of fire, cast into the river. And many of Gods servants in
this land, as well as in other parts, in the memory of our fathers have been salted with this fire; call you it whether you please, either the fire of martyr∣dome, or martyrdome of fire. And howsoever this fire in the dayes of Queen Mary was quenched especially by the blood of the slaine for the testimony of Jesus Christ, as the fire in the city of theLiv. decad 3. l. 8 Bruson. facet. & exempl. l. 1.Astapani (as Livie observeth) when no water could lave it our, was extinguished with the blood of the ci∣tizens: yet wee know not but that it may bee kindled againe, unlesse wee blow out the coales of wrath against us with the breath of our prayers, or dead them with our teares. Admit that that fire should never bee kindled a∣gaine, yet God hath many other fires to salt us withall, burning feavers, fie∣ry serpents, thunder and lightning, heart-burning griefes and sorrowes, losse of dearest friends, wracke of our estates, infamy, disgrace, vexations, oppres∣sions, indignation at the prosperity of the wicked, terrors of conscience, and spirituall derelictions. And God grant that either by the fire of the Word, or of the Spirit, or seasonable afflictions, our fleshly corruptions may bee so burned out in this life, that wee bee not salted hereafter with the fire of hell; which burneth, but lighteth not; scorcheth, but yet consumeth not; worketh without end both upon soule and body, yet maketh an end of neither. O that they who are frozen in their sins were somtimes singed and thawed with the consideration of this infernall and eternall fire! If they did but minde it, they could not but feare it; and if they feared it, they would in time seeke meanes to escape it; and if they sought them in time, they might find them in my text. And so I passe from the salting of men with fire, to the seasoning of sacrifices with salt. Every sacrifice shall bee salted with salt. There was nothing but2 King. 2.14. death and barrennesse in the waters of Jericho till Elisha cast salt in the springs. In these waters SaintIsidor. Pelus. ep. 16. . Isidore descryeth a type of our naturall estate, wherein we were dead in sinnes, and barren of good workes, till the true Elisha, Christ Jesus, cast salt in the springs, I meane, our hearts, whence are the issues of life. Salt hath three most knowne properties; 1 To powder: 2 To season: 3 To cleanse. It powdereth flesh, and keepeth it from putrefaction: it seasoneth meats and drinkes: and it cleanseth wounds, fretting and eating out the corrupt matter in them. And answerable hereunto there are three effects of the word mixed with faith; 1 It powdereth the heart: 2 It seasoneth the speech: 3 It cleanseth the sores of wounded consciences. Materiall salt is not more necessary in our houses, than this spirituall salt in the house of God; for without it no taste of goodnesse, no relish of ho∣linesse, no sapour pleasing to God. In some sacrifices of the old law, flesh, in some wine, in some oyle, in some meale; but in all and with all salt was
offered. These sacrifices were not onely shadowes of the body, which was Christs sacrifice on the crosse; but also types of our spirituall sacrifices: the meat offerings of our almes deeds, whereby wee feed the hungry; the drink offerings of our penitent teares; the peace offerings of our praise and thanks∣giving; the heave offerings of our elevated desires and affections; the whole burnt offering or holocaust of martyrdome for the testimony of the Gospel. And as the legall sacrifices were seasoned with salt, and consumed with fire; so all our spirituall sacrifices must bee seasoned with the salt of discretion, and consumed with the fire of zeale. And because the zeale is in the man, and the discretion is seene in his offering, it is said, Every man shall bee salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall bee salted with salt. To begin with the holo∣caust, or whole burnt-offering. When a servant of Christ overcommeth the violence of fire by his faith, and remaines as unmoved in the torment thereof, as theGodwin in Archiep Cant. Cranmerus flammâ saevien∣te, erectis in coelum oculis, Domine suscipe spiritum meum exclamavit, & corpore tam immotus persti∣tit quam palus cui alligatus est. stake at which hee is burnt: in this sacrifice salt is most ne∣cessary, I meane, the salt of spirituall wisedome and religious discretion. For a man must not offer himselfe to the mercilesse flames; but being adjud∣ged to them, and by the secular arme brought to them, patiently and cheer∣fully suffer them, rather than deny the Lord that bought him. No man must seale the truth of the Gospell with his blood, unlesse hee bee called in as a witnesse, and required to depose: and then hee must not onely depose in a free profession of his faith, but also deposite his life for the further confirma∣tion of his Christian profession. He that is called to suffer, must in the first place consider for what he suffereth; for all are not blessed that suffer, but those thatMat. 5.10. suffer for righteousnesse. Blessed, indeed most blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousnesse sake; not those who are executed as ma∣lefactors, for murder, felony, blasphemy, schisme, obstinacy or fancy. None dyeth a Martyr but hee who dyeth for the faith by which the just li∣veth. If a Jew bee scourged to death for the abrogated rites of the cere∣moniall law: or a Jesuited Papist hanged, drawne, and quartered, according to the penall statutes of this kingdome, for treason against the Prince, in the Popes quarrell: or if an Anabaptist bee burned to ashes for his fanaticall and fantasticall revelations; hee dyeth the Popes, or his owne Martyr, not Christs. His suffering, asEp. 1. Si oc∣cisi extra eccle∣siam fuerint, corona fidei non est, sed po∣tius poena per∣fidiae. Cyprian the blessed Martyr determineth the point against all heretickes, is, Poena perfidiae, non corona fidei, a punishment for his heresie or perfidiousnesse, not a crowne of faith or a wreath of glory. Another sacrifice of the whole man, is when a devout Christian giveth up his members as servants unto righteousnesse, and his whole body as a li∣vingRom. 12.1. sacrifice unto God: in this likewise the salt of spirituall wisdome and discretion is most requisite. For wee must so devote our selves to the ser∣vice of God, that we altogether forget not our duty to man: we must so fol∣low the things that are above, that we neglect not our affaires below, quit not our calling on earth, much lesse in aspiring to angelicall perfection, cast our selves down beneath Heathens and Infidels, by casting away all care of provision for our1 Tim. 5.8. If any provide not for his owne, and especially those of his house, or kin∣red, hee hath de∣nied the faith, and is worse than an Infidell. family. There was never any sect had a more plausible pretext for their heresie than the Euchites, who nothing but praied continu∣ally: yet because they distinguished not between time and season, mis-under∣standing the precept of the Apostle,1 Thes. 5.17. pray continually; which requireth that we pray upon every occasion, and at all seasons, that is, fit houres for prayer,
not simply, at all times which are allotted us by God forEccl. 3.1. every purpose un∣der heaven; but especially because they jusled out all other duties of piety and Christian charity for it, they were themselves by the ancient Fathers driven out of the Church, and deservedly excommunicated, whoEpiph haeres. Massal & Eu∣chi. & Aug. de haeres. ad quod vult Deum. commu∣nicated nothing to the publicke, but were all for their private devotion. Undoubtedly, as when the fattest and best of the sacrifice was consumed, the Priests might take the rest for their use; so after wee have given God the flower and best of our time, the rest wee may, nay wee must employ in the workes of our speciall calling for our owne and others behoofe. Next to the sacrifice of the whole man is the sacrifice of the hidden man, of the heart, I meane,Psal. 51.17. a broken spirit, and contrite heart. In this sacrifice the salt of discretion is as necessary as in the former. For even godly sor∣row must not exceed, the rivers of Paradise must bee kept within their bankes. A man may pricke his heart for his sinne, nay wound it, but hee must not kill it. Hee may dive deepe into the waters of Mara, but not stay so long under the water till hee bee drowned. Hee that hath grievously wronged Gods justice by presumption, let him take heede that hee doe not more wrong his mercy by desperation: his sinnes can be but finite, but Gods mercy, and Christs merits are infinite. There remaines yet two other sacrifices, the sacrifice of the tongue, and the sacrifice of the hand, Prayer, and Almes-deeds: Prayers are tearmedHos. 14.2. Render the calves of your lips. Vituli labiorum, the Calves of the lippes; and Almes-deeds are graced with the title ofHeb. 13.16. To doe good and communicate for∣get not, for with such scarifices God is well pleased. sacrifices by the Apostle; and Saint Austine yeeldeth a good reason for it; because God accepteth these pro sacrificiis, or prae sacrificiis, for, or before all sacrifices. With both these salt must bee offered, the salt of discretion with the one, and of admonition with the other: spirituall wisedome must guide both the lifting up of our hands to God, and the stretching them out to our brethren. First for prayer. No unsavory prayers proceeding from a corrupt heart are pleasing to God; no words sound well in his eares but such as are conso∣nant to his word, and minister grace to the hearers. Let myPsal. 141.2. prayer, saith the Psalmist, be directed to thee as incense; prayer must be directed, not suddenly throwne up, as it were at all adventures. Wisdome and intention must direct it, not to Saints and Angels, but to God. As it must be directed, and that to God; so in the third place it must be directed as incense from a burning cen∣ser, that is, a zealous heart; or, to use the phrase of my text, it must be sea∣soned with salt, the salt of discretion, and salted with fire, the fire of zeale. Is this to pray & praise God, to draw neare to him with our lips, when our hearts are farre from him? to lift up our eyes and hands to heaven when our mindes are on earthly things? is this to pray unto, or praise God, to vent out our unhallowed desires and indigested thoughts in broken words, without any premeditation, order, or connexion? No surely, this is not to offer to God Vitulos labiorum, the calves of our lippes, but labia vitulorum, the lippes of calves. You heare how needfull salt is in the sacrifice of the tongue: as necessa∣ry it is in the sacrifice of the hands.Psal. 41.1. Blessed is hee, saith the Kingly Pro∣phet, qui intelligit super egenum, who considereth the poore and needy; that is, first taketh notice of their condition and quality, and accordingly relieveth
them, lest otherwise hee contribute to idlenesse, and not to necessity. Some want worke to their will, others will to worke: some are impotent indeed, others are counterfeit: to the one a gift is an almes-deed, to the other the best almes is to give them a sharp admonition, or send them with their er∣rand to the House of correction. The Philosopher might say when he be∣stowed an almes upon a lewd rogue,Plutarch. apoph. Non homini dedised humanitati, Not to the man but to manhood; not to his person, but to his nature; not to his ill conditions, but to his miserable condition: but he that feareth God must take heed that he cast not seede upon accursed earth, lest it bring forth the fruits of Gomorrha; or it prove like the seed sowne byOvid. Met l. 3. Vipereos den∣tes populi in∣crementa futu∣ri, &c. Crescit∣que seges clype∣ata virorum. Cadmus, whence grew up on the sudden armed men, I meane an army of sturdy beggars, armed against us in the high-wayes. Hee must make a conscience both what he giveth, and out of what, and in what manner, and to what end. First, what; hee must not give the childrens bread to dogges: secondly, out of what; hee must not give to God of that which hee hath stollen from man, or got by any indirect courses, for this were to make God accessary to his stollen goods: thirdly, in what manner; manu serendum, non corbe, hee must cast seede out thriftily by the hand, not carelesly throw it out of the basket; he must so draw out that the spring of bounty be not exhausted: fourthly, to what end; to glorifie God, not to receive praise from men; to relieve want, not to maintaine vice. Though his left hand must not know what his right hand doth, yet his right eye must know and direct his right hand to poure the oyle into the wounds of the Samaritane, and not to spill it upon the sound flesh. As eye-salve laid to the foote profiteth not at all; and a plaster or poultess made for the feete, if it be applyed to the eye endangereth the sight: so bounty misplaced doth more hurt than good, benefacta malè loca∣ta, malefacta arbitror. The application.I wish it were so in the ministring physicke for the soule, as it is in the physicke for the body, where the Physitian prescribeth, and the Apotheca∣ry ministreth: the Physitian maketh, or appointeth the making of the salve, and leaves it to the Apothecary to apply it. For of all texts this needes most warily to bee applyed, because there is in it both fire and salt; and fire if it bee layd close will scorch, and salt if it bee rubbed into a wound will make it smart. Howbeit the best is, that rule in corporall physicke holdeth also in this; Nulla medicamenta tam faciunt dolorem quam quae sunt salu∣taria, The more bitter the potion for the most part the more effectuall; and the more smarting the plaster the more wholesome. To apply therefore in a word. In the setting forth of any banquet or service, fire and salt must bee at hand; fire to dresse the meat, and salt to season it. Likewise in the sacrifices of the old law neither fire nor salt could bee wanting; salt to prepare the sa∣crifices for the altar, and fire to consume them upon it. Neither can there be any spirituall sacrifice, or evangelicall service acceptable unto God, with∣out the fire of zeale, and salt of discretion. Zealous discretion, and discreet zeale is a rare composition, not of art but of grace, which maketh both our persons and our offering agreeable unto God. No cold service, nor unsa∣vory dish is for his taste: without heate of zeale the sacrifice wee offer is the sacrifice of dead men; and without salt of discretion the sacrifice wee offer is a sacrifice of fooles. Prophanenesse and worldlinesse cold in the true wor∣ship
of God, offereth a dead sacrifice; and idolatry and superstition hot in the false worship, offereth a foolish sacrifice; religion in the middle, being zealous in the true service of a God, offereth a holy, living, and reasonable sacrifice unto him; by zealous discretion pleasing God; and by discreet zeale men. Some offer unto God fire, but want salt, they are zealous with∣out discretion: some have salt, but want fire, they are discreet but without zeale. The Papists have fire, fervent zeale, but they want salt, direction from Gods word, and judgement to discerne betweene reasonable service and will-worship; and for want of this salt their devotions are tainted with much superstition. The conformable Protestant hath store of salt, whol∣some directions from Gods word to season his spirituall sacrifices, but doth hee not want fire? is hee as zealous for Christ as the other is for Anti-christ? doth hee contribute as freely to the pure worship of God, as the other doth to the garish service of the Masse? are his eyes as often fixed on Christ in heaven, as the others are on his crucifixe? doth hee keepe the Lords day as strictly as the other doth our Ladies, and other Saints? Al∣though the Papist hath no command for hallowing any day to Saints, es∣pecially such as wee finde in the Romane Kalendar: wee have both the command of God, and the injunctions of the Church to devote this dayHomily of the time and place of prayer. wholly to the service of God; yet how many Clients on this day besiege your doores, when you and wee all should bee Clients onely unto God? Should God deale so with us in our portion of time on the weeke-dayes, as wee deale with him in his; should hee restraine the light of the sunne, and take away so many houres from every day in the weeke, as wee defaulk from his service on this day, what darkenesse, what out-cryes, what hor∣rour, what confusion would bee in all the world? WhenXen Cyr. paed. l. 2. Cyrus was young, Sacas was appointed by his Grandfather to bee his moderatour, both in his diet, recreations, and all expence of time; but when hee grew riper in yeeres hee became a Sacas to himselfe, and tooke not so much li∣berty as Sacas would have given him. Where the law seemeth too laxe, there every man ought to bee a Sacas to himselfe, and for the health of his soule forbeare something that is permitted to the recreation of his body. Againe, those who are of the stricter and preciser sort have fire in their in∣vectives against Popery, in their reproofe of sinne, and their voluntary and extemporary devotions; but they want many a graine of salt, and there∣fore offer often times, with Nadab and Abihu, strange fire upon Gods altar: they distinguish not betweene Episcopall Hierarchy and Papall tyranny; superstitious rites and comely ceremonies; decent ornaments and meretrici∣ous painting of Christs spouse. They are alwayes Boanerges, and seldome or never Barnabasses; alwayes Sons of thunder, and seldome or never Sons of consolation. And when they are Sonnes of thunder, and cast forth their lightning, it is not like the lightning whereofPlin. nat. hist. c. 51. l. 2. Martia gravida icta partu exanima∣to vixit. Pliny writeth, which kil∣led Martia's childe in her wombe, but hurt not her at all; that is, destroy sinne in the conscience, but no way hurt the person in his reputation: but contrariwise, they blast the person, but kill not the sin. Their prayers are all fiery indeed, burning with zeale, and therein commendable; but for want of salt of discretion they make all things fuell for this sacred fire; like fire their devotion keeps within no bounds. As the ringing, so the praying now
adayes in request is all upon the changes, the round of a set forme is utterly despised; and as ringers in the changes, so these in their extemporary ori∣sons, goe up and downe, backward and forward, are often at a stand, use vaineMat. 6.7. repetitions prohibited by our Saviour, and by clashing phrases, as the A∣postle speaketh, make1 Tim. 1.6. vaine janglings.

I hope it is not so, I pray God it bee never so, but that wee may bee alwayes like pure and wholsome salt, preserving our selves and others from corruption. The good will of him who appeared in the fiery bush, salt our persons with the fire of the Word, Spirit, and seasonable Affli∣ctions, and season our sacrifices with the salt of faith and discre∣tion, that God may have alwayes respect to us and our sacrifice for the merits of Christs infinite sacrifice offered on the Altar of the Crosse. To whom, &c.
THE SPIRITUALL BETHESDA. A Sermon preached at a Christening in Lambeth Church, the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Lord Duke of Buckingham being God-Fathers, October 29. Anno Dom. 1619. THE SIXTEENTH SERMON. MARKE 1.9. And it came to passe in those dayes that Jesus came from Nazareth of Ga∣lilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. BEing to treate of a subject agreeable to the occasion of our present meeting, I have made choice of this Scripture, representing unto us the baptisme and (if I may so speake) the christening of Christ him∣selfe. 1 Because the baptisme of Christ here related by the Evangelist cleansed the holy Font, and sanctified the river Jordan, and other waters, to the spirituall ablution of the soule, and fetching out of stains and spots out of the conscience, not by the infusi∣on of any supernaturall quality into the water, but by annexing a gratious promise to the religious use of the element, according to his ordinance. For to this end especially (as SaintAug. Ser. de temp 30. Non ut sibi munditiem ac∣quireret, sed ut nobis fluenta purgaret. Austine observeth) our Saviour would bee baptized, To sanctifie the Font in himselfe, not to cleanse him∣selfe in the Font. In which respect wee may rightly tearme Christ his
baptisme, baptisma baptismatis, the christening of baptisme it selfe, in as much as our Lord by the descending into the water, raised it above it's owne pitch, and of a corporall Bath made it a spirituall Laver, of an earthly Element an heavenly Sacrament; and this I take to bee the riches which that holy Father saith Christ put into the river Jordan, in like manner as the Geographers report, that the Indians yeerely throw in a great masse of gold and silver into the river Ganges. Christs body, saith hee,Aug. ser. 1. de Epiph. Attactu corpora tin∣guntur, & flu∣enta ditantur, vitalem{que} grati∣am non corpus ex flumine, sed flumen mutua∣tur ex corpore. was washed, and the streame thereby was enriched; the body received not vertue from the water, but the water from his body. 2 Because Christ was not baptized for himselfe, but for us, to wash a∣way that filth and corruption which wee draw from the loines of our pa∣rents. As the cause of his baptisme was in us, so the effect was for us; hee was baptized corporally in his naturall body, that wee might bee baptized spiritually in his mysticall. As for himselfe, his immaculate conception preserved him from originall corruption; and therefore the remedy of baptisme, to him in respect of himselfe, was needlesse, on whom the disease neither had nor could fasten: but as for us he had bin before circumcised, so for us was he now baptized, who believe and are baptized in his name. SoJoh. 17.19. For their sakes I san∣ctifie myselfe, that they might be tru∣ly sanctified, nei∣ther pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me throught their word. himselfe testifieth. As our superfluities were pared off with his knife in cir∣cumcision, so our spots were washed away with water in baptisme: by his baptisme of water wee are cleansed from originall, and by his baptisme of blood in the garden and on the crosse, from all our actuall sinne. When hee went downe into the river, hee carried our old man with him, and drow∣ned him there in Jordan. To which point SaintAmb. in Luk. Unus mersit, sed lavit omnes, unus descendit ut ascendere∣mus omnes, u∣nus omnium peccata susce∣pit, ut in illo omnium pecca∣ta morerentur. Ambrose speaketh as fully as elegantly; One dived into the water, but he washed all; one descended that wee might all ascend; one tooke upon him the sinnes of all, that hee might destroy the sinnes of all in himselfe. 3 Because Christs baptisme was the perfect sampler and patterne of ours. For as Christ was washed with water, so is a Christian. As when Christ was baptized theMat. 3.16.17. three persons in the Trinity manifested them∣selves, the Father by a voice from heaven, the Sonne by the water, the holy Ghost by the dove; so likewise in our baptisme the three persons are expresly mentioned, In the name of the Father, &c. Lastly, as at Christs baptisme the heavens were opened, and the holy Spirit descended on our Saviour in the similitude of a dove, so at the christening of the children of the faithfull, who are innocent like doves, the heavens are opened, and the grace of the holy Spirit descendeth upon them: and after this their new birth by Water and the Spirit, God acknowledgeth them for his Sonnes. Thus farre you heare a perfect concord betweene Christs baptisme and ours: but in one circumstance, which I am now to touch upon, there seemeth a discord: for Christ was baptized in his perfect age, wee in our infancy or nonage. In those dayes, saith myLuk. 3.1. Evangelist, about the be∣ginning of Johns baptisme, which was in the fifteenth yeere of the reigne of Tiberius Caesar,vers. 23. when Jesus himselfe began to bee about thirty yeeres of age. At which circumstance of time the Anabaptists greedily catch, as men that are in danger of drowning lay hold on flagges, and rotten stakes by the bank side that are not able to support them. For though Christ were not baptized till hee came to his perfect age, it doth not thence ensue that wee ought
our baptisme so long, or that if we were christened in our infancy, wee ought to bee baptized againe in our perfect age, when wee can give a good account of the hope that is in us, after the manner of the Anabaptists. For neither was Christ rebaptized, neither is Christs case and ours alike. Not therefore to lay much stresse upon Aquinas his resolution, that Christ was baptized in his perfect age, to shew that baptisme maketh a man perfect, which is in effect to say, that this delay of baptisme in Christ was of a my∣sticall signification, not for our necessary imitation. I answer that Christ his example in this case ought to bee no president for us; and that for many reasons: 1 Our Saviour in his infancy received circumcision, which then was in stead of baptisme, it being the authenticall seale of Gods covenant: and it was not requisite that two broad seales, if I may so call them, of the King of heaven should bee put to the same deed, at the same time, both being entire. Neither was it convenient that the figure and the verity, the type and the antitype, the sacrament of the old and of the new should meet at the same period; but that there should be a good distance of time between them. 2 Christ needed not baptisme at all for himselfe, being conceived and borne without sinne, and therefore there could be no danger in deferring his baptisme in that regard: but wee are conceived and borne in sinne, and have no remedy to heale the leprous contagion of our birrh, but by being washed in this Jordan, which Christ sanctified by his baptisme. Wherefore it is no way safe for us to put off this sacrament, the onely cure of this ma∣lady, lest God take us out of this world whilst our filthy scurfe and sores are upon us. 3 Christ desired not to bee baptized of John, to bee cleansed thereby, but either (as I shewed before) to sanctifie baptisme it selfe, or to receive a testimony from the Father and from John, and to declare himselfe to the world; in which regard hee deferred his baptisme till the time was come when hee should take off the vaile from his face, and suffer the rayes of di∣vine majesty to breake forth. 4 Our Font is alwayes open, or ready to bee opened, and the Minister attends to receive the children of the faithfull, and dip them in that sacred Laver: but in Christs infancy there was neither Baptist nor baptisme. Before our Saviour was thirty yeeres of age, either Saint John had not his Commission to baptize, or at least began not to execute it: but as soone as hee tooke upon him that holy office, and unsealed the sacred Font, and multitudes came to him from all parts; In those dayes came Jesus from Ga∣lilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. Having spoken of the substance, Christs baptisme, let us now poize the circumstances, which are all weighty, and beare downe the scale of Christs humility to the ground. 1 That Christ in his perfect age should take, if I may so speake, the fe∣straw into his hand, and bee entred in his Primer, and receive the token of the first admittance into his owne schoole. 2 That he should not expect John to come and tender his service to him, but should take a long journey to meet with the Baptist.
3 That hee should daigne to let him lay his hands on his head, who was not worthy toMat. 3.11. untye his shooe; that the fountaine of all christianity, in whose name wee are all baptized, should receive his christendome, as wee speake, from another, and bee baptized in the open and common river Jor∣dan. Each of these considerations addeth a degree of descent to our Savi∣ours humility, and consequently a degree of ascent to his glory. For there is nothing more glorious than for highest majesty to humble himselfe in the lowest and lowliest manner. ThePlin. in Pane∣gyr. Curiad sum∣mum fastigium nihil superest, is uno modo cres∣cere potest si se submiserit. tree that is at the highest pitch can no otherwise grow than downeward. 1 If Christ would bee baptized, why not in his infancy? why in his perfect age would hee stoope to the chil∣drens Font, or, to speake more properly, the spirituall Lazars bath, in those dayes when hee was about thirty yeeres of age? 2 If in that age hee would be baptized, to grace and countenance Johns baptisme, why yet did hee not send for John to come to him? why did hee take a voyage to John? why did hee seeke after, and runne to his forerunner? Jesus came from Ga∣lilee. 3 If hee would take such a journey to be baptized, having no need of baptisme for himselfe, to fulfill all righteousnesse for us, why would hee not bee baptized by anLuk. 2.21. His name was called Jesus, which was so named of the Angell before hee was conceived in the wombe. Angell, who first named him Jesus, but by John his servant? Was baptized of John. 4 If hee would bee baptized by a man, the rather to prove his manhood, or countenance the ministery of man, why gave hee not order for some Font of gold to bee made for him, in a princely palace? why would hee uncloath himselfe in the open ayre, and goe downe into the common river Jordan, to bee washed there as an ordinary man? Why all this, but to exalt his glory by humility, and to teach us to stoope low, when wee enter in at the gate of Christs schoole? In those dayes, &c. Perfection it selfe in his full age taketh the remedy of our imperfections; Jesus receiveth baptisme. The way it selfe taketh along and tedious journey; Jesus came from Nazareth to Galilee. TheLeo ser. de E∣piph. Descende∣re in se fontem foelix unda mi∣ratur. fountain of all purity is washed, And was baptized. The Lord and author of baptisme re∣ceiveth his owne badge and cognizance from his servant, Of John. The boundlesse ocean descendeth into the river, In Jordan. Well might, saith Barradius, the heavens bee opened, that the Angels might behold this wonderfull sight. A strange and wonderfull baptisme indeed, in which he that was washed was purer than the Font it selfe, in which the person is not sanctified by the Sacrament, but the Sacrament by the person. A strange and wonderfull baptisme, in which he is baptized with water, who baptizeth with the holy Ghost and with fire. A strange and wonderfull bap∣tisme, in which the person baptized is the Sonne of God, and the two wit∣nesses the Father and the holy Spirit. A strange and wonderfull baptisme, in which not the Church doore but heaven gates were opened, and in stead of a Sermon from the mouth of a mortall man, there was heard a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleased. Ob∣serve, I beseech you, in this and other straines of the sweet harmony of the Evangelists, how the Bases and Trebles answer one the other; how where they depresse our Saviour most in his humanity, there they raise him high∣est in his divinity. In the passages of one and the selfe same story, where you finde most pregnant proofes of his infirmity and humility as man, there you have also most evident demonstration of his majesty and glory
as God. What greater humility than to lye for many moneths in the dark prison of the Virgins wombe, and to bee borne of a poore handmaid? this sheweth him to bee a true man; yet what greater glory than to bee conceived of the holy Ghost, and to have a regiment of heavenly Souldiers, to guard him as it were into the world, and a quire of Angels to sing at his birth? this demonstrateth him to bee God. What greater argument of his humility than to bee borne in an Inne, lodged in a Stable, and laid in a Manger? this sheweth him to bee virum dolorum, a man in distresse and great necessity; yet what greater glory than to bee manifested by a starre, and presented by the Heathen Sages with Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrhe? this demonstrateth him to bee God. What greater humili∣ty than to bee carried up and downe from place to place by Satan, and to bee tempted by that foule fiend? this sheweth him to bee a man; yet what greater glory than to be attended on, and ministred unto byMat. 4.11. Then the Divell leaveth him, and behold Angels came and mini∣stred unto him. Angels in the desart? this demonstrateth him to bee God. What greater humi∣lity than to suffer himselfe to bee taken by the high Priests servants armed with swords and staves against him, as if hee had beene a Malefactor? this sheweth him to bee a man, and that of little or no reputation among the Rulers; yet what greater glory than with the breath of his mouth to cast downe those that assaulted him, and make them fallJohn 18.6. As soone as hee had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. backeward to the ground, in such sort that hee might have trampled them under his feete? this demonstrateth him to bee God. What greater humility than to bee nailed to the crosse, and to dye in torments? this sheweth him to bee a mortall man; yet what greater glory than at his death to eclipse the sunne, and obscure the heavens, and move the earth, and cleave the rockes, and rend the vaile of the Temple from the toppe to the bottome, and open graves? this demonstrateth him to be God In like manner here in my text, what greater testimony of humility, than to descend into the river, and suffer himselfe to bee baptized by John? yet what greater glory than at his baptisme to have the heavens opened, and the holy Ghost in a visible shape to descend upon him, and God the Father from heaven to acknowledge him for his Sonne? this demonstrateth him to bee God. But to bound my selfe within the eclipticke line of my text, where it followeth, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee. Nazareth was a little towne or village in Galilee, where our Saviour dwelt with his parents for many yeeres, and from his a∣boad there tooke the appellation of Nazarene. This his countrey with his person was highly exalted upon the crosse the Trophee of his victory over the world; as appeareth by that inscription, Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jewes.Hieron. de nom Hebr. Drusius ad voces N. T. com∣ment. Steph. interp. nom. Heb. Nazareth signifieth florem, or virgultum ejus, a flower, or a twigge, derived fromBuxlorf. epit. rad. Natsar sur∣culus, sic dictus quod custodiâ & curâ egeat, ne à vento deji∣ciatur aut fran∣gatur. Natsar, to keepe, or warily to looke to, because flowers or tender plants need care, lest they bee blowne downe with a winde, or otherwise wronged. Upon which grounds SaintBer. de concept. Christ. Voluit concipiflos in flore intra flo∣rem, id est, intra Nazareth, ut fi∣eret ipse flos flo∣rens, id est, Na∣zarenus. Bernard thus pleasantly descanteth: The sweet flower of Jesse would bee conceived in the wombe of the blessed virgin, a most sweet and unblasted flower, planted in Na∣zareth the flower of Galilee, that he might budde and become a Nazarene, that is, a flourishing flower. I will adde no more at this time of Naza∣reth, but that as it was said of Archelaus, thatEras. Adag. Non Euripides ex Archelai, sed Archelaus ex Euripidis ami∣citiâ nomen as∣sequutus est. Euripides was not famous for his acquaintance with Archelaus, but Archelaus for his acquaintance
with Euripides: so for ought I ever read, Christ was not ennobled by Na∣zareth, but Nazareth honoured, nay rather eternized by Christs dwelling in it. This Nazareth is situate in Galilee, where our Lord first preached the Gospell of the Kingdome, and declared the power of his Deity by many signes and wonders; and because his Countrey-men shewed least respect to his person, and gave least credit to his doctrine, it fell out by the just judgement of God in the conquest of Palaestine by the Romanes, that the Galileans first smarted for their unbeliefe, the whole countrey being spoi∣led and laid waste by Vespasian. From Galilee we returne with our Saviour to Judaea, where hee met John, and was Baptized of him. At the first mention of our Lords baptisme this obje∣ction offereth it selfe to every mans conceit. The whole need not the Phy∣sitian, but they that are sicke; the cleane need not to be washed, but they that are foule; the innocent neede not to aske or receive pardon, but the guilty; why then should the health and salvation of all mankind take this purge? why should the immaculate lambe bee washed in the Font? why did hee desire the seale of remission of sinnes, who knew no sinne, neither was there guile found in his mouth? 1 S.Amb. in Luk. 2. Baptizatus est Dominus non mundati vo∣lens, sed mun∣dare aquas, ut ablutae per car∣nem Christi, quae peccatum non novit, bap∣tismatis jus ha∣berent. Ambrose answereth, that our Lord was baptized, not that hee might bee cleansed by the water, but (as was touched before) intending thereby to cleanse and sanctifie the water, that being washed by Christs flesh, it might thereby bee elevated to bee an instrument of the holy Ghost in the spirituall washing of the soule. 2 SaintAug. de. bapt. Christ. Ne ho∣mines grava∣rentur ad bap∣tismum Domini venire, cum Dominus ipse non gravaretur ad baptismum servi venire. Austine addeth that our Saviour vouchsafed to bee baptized, to draw all men to Christian baptisme; for why should any refuse to come to the Lords baptisme, when the Lord himselfe daigned to come to the baptisme of his servant? 3 Saint Jerome assigneth a third reason of Christs receiving baptisme from John, viz. that hee might ratifie, and give authority to Saint Johns baptisme. 4Calvin. haerm. evang. Ut certi∣ùs sibi persua∣deant fideles se in Christi corp, inseri, & conse∣peliri cum eo in baptismo, ut in novitate vitae resurgant. Calvin yeeldeth a fourth reason, that the faithfull might bee more assured that they are engraffed into Christ, and are buried together with him in baptisme, that they may rise up againe with him in newnesse of life. But our Saviours reason must stand for all, thus it becom∣meth to fulfill all righteousnesse: the righteousnesse of the law hee had ful∣filled in that behalfe, in being circumcised the eighth day; and now hee began to fulfill the righteousnesse of the Gospell. The ceremoniall law was in force in Christs infancy, which required circumcision; and now the Gospell began to bee in force: after Johns baptisme circumcision went out, and baptisme came in with John: therefore it was now requisite that Christ should bee baptized; But why should hee bee baptized of John? Of John. It had beene an office beseeming the first of the Angelicall Hierarchy, to lay hands on the head of the Church: True; but Jesus now came in humility, and as hee was in the forme of a servant, so hee vouchsa∣fed to bee baptized of a servant. The Lord commeth to doe honour to his servant, the sunne to bee enlightned by a starre, the fountaine to bee wa∣shed in his owne streame, the roote to receive sappe and moisture from the branch, God to receive the Sacrament from man. This doth not more set forth our Lords humility than adde to Johns glory. And questionlesse a speciall reason that moved our Saviour to receive baptisme from Saint John was, to countenance Johns ministry, and to give authority to his fel∣low-labourer,
and, if I may so speake, under-workman. For John brought stones to Jesus, and cut them for the building, and Jesus layd them in the foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem, neare himselfe the corner stone: John rough-hewed the Jewes with the axe of Gods judgements threatned against them,Mat. 3.10. The axe is layd to the root of the tree, &c. to cut them downe and cast them into hell-fire, unlesse they re∣pented; Christ smoothed and polished them with the doctrine of the Gospell, that they might bee likePsal. 144.12. the polished corners of the Temple; or like theLam. 4.7. Nazarites, whose polishing was of Saphire: John washed the sores of wounded consciences with water, as the Jailer didAct. 16.33. Paul and Si∣las stripes of body; Christ healed them with the ointment of the spirit: John cleansed the inward roomes of the soule by the water of baptisme and penitent teares; Christ strawed the swept roomes with the flowers of Paradise: John began, Christ finished; John baptized with water, Christ with the holy Ghost and with fire: Jesus and John resemble the Cheru∣bins in the Arke, casting a gracious looke one upon the other: Alter in alterius jacientes lumina vultum. Jesus like the sunne casteth light upon John, and John like a Chrystall glasse reflects it upon him. Jesus saith ofJoh. 5.35. John he was a burning and shining lampe, JohnJoh. 1.34. saith of Jesus, This is the Sonne of God: Jesus testifieth of John, that hee was Elias, John of Jesus that hee was the Messias: Jesus pointeth to John, saying,Mat. 11.9. Behold a Prophet, yea and more than a Pro∣phet; John to Jesus, saying,Joh. 1.29. Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sinnes of the world: Jesus commeth to honour John in desiring his baptisme; John by putting him back at the first, honoureth him the more, saying, IMat. 3.14. have neede to bee baptized of thee, and commest thou to me? John saith of Jesus,Mat. 3.11. I am not worthy to beare his shooes; Jesus saith of John in effect, I account him worthy to lay hands on my head. I have gone down the foure former steps and descents of our Saviours hu∣mility, I am now to descend to the fift, which was Christs descending into Jordan, and his vouchsafing to accept of the water of that common ri∣ver to consecrate baptisme in his owne body. The Ancients, who deligh∣ted much in Acrostickes, wrote for Christ, , that is, a Fish: for if you take the first letters of these words, , (Jesus Christ the son of God crucified) and joine them together, they make the word . This , or mystical Fish is taken by John in the river Jor∣dan, and that head before which the Cherubins and Seraphins,Caput tremen∣dum potestati∣bus inclinatur ab homine. and all Prin∣cipalities in heaven bow, is bowed by John on earth, and dipped under the water in the river Jordan; this the particle  intimateth, , that is word for word, Hee was baptized into the river Jordan. Here if you demand with the curious Schoole-Divines, why Jordan hath the honour and precedencie of all other rivers? why Christ made not choice rather of the Red sea, to bee baptized in it as hee fled into Egypt, considering the Red sea was an evident type of baptisme? For as Pharaoh and his hoste were drowned in the Red sea, so all our spirituall enemies are destroyed in the Red sea of Christs blood, whereof the waters of baptisme are a figure. Wee neede not goe farre for answer, the words immediately going be∣fore
may resolve the point in question: Jesus came to bee baptized of John who baptized at this time in Jordan; Christ chose not John to baptize him for Jordans sake, but Jordan to be baptized in for Johns sake. Howbe∣it it if you will dive deeper into Jordan, you may find in it a more remarkable type of baptisme than in the Red sea. For as Zeno the Bishop of Verona long agoe observed, the Israelites after they had passed the Red sea came into the wildernesse; but wee passe through the Red sea of Christs blood over into Paradise. The river Jordan was in the children of Israels way to the land of promise, so is the water of baptisme in ours to the coelestiall Canaan. Shall I adde out of SaintAug. ser. 2. de Epiph. Sicut a∣quae Jordanis conversae sunt transeuntibus Israelitis, Ita Christo bapti∣zato retrorsum peccata con∣versa sunt. Austine, that as the waters of the river Jordan were turned backe when the Israelites passed over it; so at this en∣try of Christ into Jordan the sinnes of all true believers were driven back, and the course of our nature turned another way? Or out ofAquinas in suplem. Elias divisit aquas Jordanis cum rapiendus esset in coelum, quia transeuntibus per aquam bap∣tismi, per ignem Spiritus sancti patet aditus in coelum. Aquinas, that as Elias after he had divided the waters of Jordan, was carried up into heaven in a fiery chariot; so after wee have parted the waters of the Font in our baptisme, through the fire of the holy Spirit wee are carried up, by divine contemplation first, and after by reall ascention into heaven? As I have sprinkled the waters of Jordan on you in the explication of my text, so give mee leave in the application to rub and cleanse some sores in you with them. 1 Christ travelled over a great part of Palaestine to Jordan to receive Johns baptisme; where are they who will not stirre out of doores to re∣ceive Christs baptisme? Jesus came himselfe to Jordan, they will have Jordan by a secret pipe conveyed into their private houses. Mistake mee not, I beseech you beloved brethren, I goe not about to streighten the bowels of our Mother the Church, which in great charity and com∣passion sendeth the water of life in baptisme to infirme infants, and the bread of life in the other Sacrament to sicke persons, who are not able to fetch them. But when the childe is strong, the minister provided, the con∣gregation assembled, if perchance there fall a drop of raine to wet their new set ruffe, or there lye any dirt in the street to foule their shooes, upon such or the like sleight occasions and frivolous pretences, to deprive God of his publike worship, the congregation of the spirituall foode, the infant of the benefit of the prayers of the whole assembly argueth a great neglect of the solemne worship of God, and an insufferable wrong to his Church. The Martyrs heretofore could not bee kept from the Church and publike mi∣nistry of the Word and Sacraments by feare of haile-shot or bullets; these are kept from it by a few drops of raine. 2 Jesus was baptized, who are they who sleightly esteeme baptisme? If the immaculate Lamb were washed in the Font of baptisme, how much more ought they to desire to be cleansed therein, who are fuller of spots than Leopards? If Christ, saith S.Ambros. in Luk. Si Christus peccata nostra lavit, quanto magis nos lava∣re peccata no∣stra convenit, si pro nobis Christus lavit, imò nos in cor∣pore suo lavit, quanto nos ma∣gis lavare deli∣cta nostra debe∣mus. Ambrose, washed for us, nay rather washed us in his owne body, how much more ought wee to wash our owne sinnes, origi∣nall in the laver of our baptisme, and actuall in the baptisme of teares? 3 Jesus vouchsafed to bee baptized of John, a man though of admira∣ble gifts, and eminent place in the Church, yet in comparison of our Sa∣viour hee was not so much as a starre of the sixt magnitude to the sunne: where are they who refuse the holy Sacraments from the hands of any mi∣nister
who is of inferiour place, or of meaner gifts, at least in their account? Doth the potion worke the lesse because the Physitian that administreth it is himselfe crazie? doth the plaster lesse heale because it is applyed by an Apothecary that hath a sore hand? doth not the lees or sope scoure white which is received from the hand of a blackmore? is a piece of coine, bee it an Angell, or Soveraigne, or Jacobus, of lesse value if it bee tendered by a beggar? They need to be better catechized, who know not that the effect of the Sacrament dependeth upon the power and promise of God, and right forme of administring it according to his Word, and not up∣on the dignity of the minister. 4 Jesus was baptized in the open and common river Jordan: where are they who disdaine the common Font? No Font will serve them but a Font of gold new made, or a silver bason with their armes on it. Saint Paul tea∣cheth us that the way to heaven is a hard and rugged, a stony and thorny way, through many afflictions; these thinke to goe to heaven treading all the way upon rich carpets, or rose leaves. By their reason Christ the Sonne of God, and Prince of heaven should have refused the common river Jor∣dan, and not have received baptisme in any river but such as Ganges or Pactolus, whose sands are said to bee full of rich Ore. Doe they thinke it is pleasant to God to keepe state in their march towards heaven? to receive the Sacrament of Christian humility in pride? to professe the renouncing of the pompes and vanities of this world, and in the very profession there∣of at the Font to shew the pompe and vanity thereof?Eras. apoph. Plat. Calcare saeculi fa∣stum majori fastu, for which Plato justly taxed Diogenes. But the time ex∣cludeth, and that whereof mine eyes are now witnesses, silenceth all such otherwise seasonable increpations. For wee all see, and rejoyce to see this infant presented by the parents to God in the Temple, and reverently and modestly brought, without displaying the ensignes of gentility, to holy baptisme; the publicke ministry is not neglected, the common Font is not despised. Such an assembly, so honourable, so religious, so full, wee rather pray for than hope for upon the like occasion in this place. Let the honour of it redound to God, the benefit to the infant to bee baptized, that the Peeres of this Kingdome, and other persons of eminent quality, have for a time absented themselves from the Kings court, and now present them∣selves in the Courts of the Lords house to adde a Lamb to Christs flocke. Such an illustrious constellation of so many starres, and some of the first magnitude, hath seldome appeared in this Horizon. What remaineth, but that wee now proceed with joy and comfort from the Pulpet to the Font, from the Word to the Sacrament, from feeding our owne soules to make a Christian soule?Solin. Polyhist. Fusca pecora vertit in candi∣da. Solinus reporteth of a river in Baeotia that it turneth the colour of the sheepe that are washed in it, in such sort that if they were before blacke or dunne, they become presently as white as milke. That may bee a fable, but this is Gospell, that such is the vertue of the conse∣crated waters of baptisme, wherein Christs lambes are usually washed through divine benediction upon this holy ordinance, that though they were never so blacke or foule before, yet after they come out of this laver they are most cleane and white, and so continue till they plunge themselves into the mire of worldly desires and fleshly lusts. Glorious things may be
spoken of thee thou Well of life. O sacred Font of God, O royall Bath of Christ, O heavenly Laver, O spirituall Bethesda, infinitely exceeding that wonderfull poole in Jerusalem mentioned by Saint John. For that healed but bodily infirmities, this cureth spirituall maladies; that healed him only that was first let downe into it after the Angell moved the water; this hea∣leth all those that are dipped into it, or sprinkled with it, after the minister, who is Gods Angell, stirreth this water: that received a medicinall vertue for the body, as Saint Jerome conceiveth, from the blood of the sacrifices that were washed in it; this receiveth a spirituall and divine vertue for the cure of the soule, from the blood of the immaculate lambe Christ Jesus. For his blood cleanseth us from all our sins. In other waters, as Zeno noteth, li∣ving creatures are cast in alive, and after they are held a good while under the water, or sink downe of themselves, are taken out dead: but contrariwise, in the sacred Font children are dipped in dead, to wit, in trespasses and sins, but are ta∣ken out alive, alive to God, enlived by his spirit, quickned by his grace. This life of grace God grant to the infant now to be metricu∣lated into the University of all Saints, and continue it in us all, that Christ may live in us here by grace, and we for evermore live with him hereafter in glory. To whom, &c.
THE LIVING TEMPLE. A Sermon preached at the Readers Feast in the Temple Church. THE SEVENTEENTH SERMON. 2 COR. 6.16. For yee are the Temple of the living God. Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. COnsecrate your hearts to the service of God, and de∣dicate your eares to his holy Word, For yee are the Temple of the living God. If the heathen Orator ma∣king an Oration in aede Concordiae (a Temple conse∣crated to their goddesse Concord) used the place for a Topick, and drew an argument from the house in∣scription where they met, to perswade peace and concord: and the Apostle himselfe tooke the advan∣tage of the title of an Altar at Athens to declare un∣to them the true God, whomAct. 17.23. I found an altar with an inscrip∣tion, To the un∣knowne God. they ignorantly worshipped: and in his Epi∣stle to Philemon alludeth to the name of his unthrifty servant ab  prosum. Phile. v. 11. I be∣seech thee for my sonne Onesimus, which in times past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me. Onesimus, assuring him that howsoever in former time he had beene unprofitable, yet that hee should now prove , according to his name Onesimus, profi∣table to both of them: I perswade my selfe it will not be offensive to you to heare a lecture read upon your name, and many holy duties enforced from the sacred appellation in my text, wherewith your honourable socie∣ty is graced, that you may bee indeed what you are called, The Temple of the living God. This text of the Temple admitteth of a like division to the partition of the Temple of Solomon, which was into three roomes or spaces:
1 Atrium, the outward court. 2 Sanctum, the holy place. 3 Sanctum sanctorum, the holy of holies. 1 In the outward court the people stood. 2 In the holy place the Priests offered their daily sacrifice. 3 In the holy of holies the high Priest appeared once a yeere. 1 Yee are, resembleth the outward court, where the people were. 2 Temple, the holy place. 3 The living God, the most holy. The Temple of God is holy, but the God of the Temple is infinitely more holy. In passing through these spaces and partitions, let the eye of your religi∣ous observation fall upon 1 The proper title of the Elect, Temple. 2 The proper owner of the Temple, God. 3 The proper attribute of God, Living. 1 For expresseth and presseth a reason, What agreement, &c. For. 2 Yee specifieth the persons. 3 Are pointeth to the time. 4 The Temple is the title of Gods children. 5 Of God is added for distinction of Temples. 6 Living is adjoyned for distinction of Gods. 1 There are many who deserve to bee called cages of uncleane birds, or rather styes of uncleane beasts, than Temples, Yee are the Temple. 2 There are Temples of Idols, or rather Devils, not of God, Yee are the Temple of God. 3 There are gods not living, Yee are the Temple of thee living God. Here is a sweet cluster of the grapes of the vine of Engaddi. 1 Presse the first grape, and it will yeeld this liquor, That Christians may not communicate with Idolaters, nor consort with prophane persons: For. 2 Presse the next grape, and it will yeeld this juice, That holinesse to God is the Imprese of the regenerate: Yee. 3 Presse the third, it yeeldeth this, That there are Saints upon earth, viz. in truth and sincerity, though not in perfection: Are. 4 Presse the fourth, it yeeldeth this, That the whole company of true be∣lievers make but one Holy Catholike Church; Temple not Temples: The Temple.
5. Presse the fift, it yeeldeth this, That reverence is due to the servants of God, that sanctity is in them, and safety with them. Of God. The Temple of God carrieth with it all three: and to whom indeed is due more reve∣rence, in whom shineth more sanctity, with whom is found more safety than Gods secret ones, who as stones coupled together, and built upon the corner stone Christ Jesus, rise up towards heaven, and become a holy temple of God? 6. Presse the last, and it yeeldeth this, That the God whom we Christians serve is the onely true living God, and source and fountaine of all life; which hee conveigheth to us in a threefold channell, 1 The broader of nature: 2 The narrower of grace: 3 The overflowing and everspringing of glory. For: The reason standeth thus. Separate your selves from wicked and profane persons, For yee are a Temple. Secondly, keep your selves from dead and dumb Idols, For yee are the Temple of the living God. First, this (For) perforce draweth us from all familiar company and inti∣mate conversation with men of a leud, dissolute or profane carriage;Ephes. 5.11. Have no fellowship with them, saith the Apostle: elsewhere,Act. 2.40. Save your selves from them, saith Saint Peter: Come out from among them, and be you2. Cor. 6.17, 18. separate, and I will be a Father unto you, and you shall bee my Sonnes and Daughters. It was an abomination by the Law to touch any dead thing,Lev. 22.4. Whosoever toucheth any thing that is uncleane by the dead, &c. and are not they that live in pleasure and sensuality1 Tim. 5.6. dead while they are alive? but she that liveth in pleasure is dead whilest shee liveth. Shee is no loyall wife that deligh∣teth in company disliked by her husband, though but upon suspition. How can the sonne but incurre his fathers displeasure, who entertaineth such guests with all love and kindnesse whom his father hateth, and forbiddeth them his house? Those who are of worth seek to preserve their credit and good name as a precious oyntment, which is soone corrupted by the impure ayre of nasty society. For such a man is deservedly esteemed to bee, with whom hee ranketh himselfe: but corrupting the soule is farre worse than tainting a good name; and who is there almost that commeth faire off from foule company? hee cannot but learne evill by them, orEpictet. . suffer evill of them. Man in Paradise might be like the plants of Paradise, of which A∣thanasius reporteth that they imparted an aromaticall savour to the trees neere adjoyning: but since man was cast out, the corruption of his nature maketh him resemble rather the wan and withered vine in the Poet, which tooke away the fresh colour and sap from the neighbour vine; Juven. sat. 1. Dedit haec contagio la∣bem, &c.Uva{que} livorem conspectâ ducit ab uvâ. It is true, Bonum est sui diffusivum, Goodnesse is of a communicative na∣ture; but since our fall wee are not so capable of receiving good as evill. The example of an evill man sooner corrupteth a good man, than a good
example converteth an evill man. The weake and watery eye is not streng∣thened by looking on a quicke or strong eye; but on the contrary, many a strong and dry eye by looking on a watery eye waters it selfe. The sound man by lying with the sicke loseth his health, yet the sicke man by lying with the whole man gaineth not his health; the exchange is not mutuall. If you mingle bright and rusty metall together, the rusty will not become bright by it, but on the contrary the bright rusty; so, saithSenec. ep. 7. Rubiginosus comes etiam candido suam affricuit rubi∣ginem. Seneca, a rusty companion rubbeth some of his rust upon a man of faire conditions, yet the man of faire conditions imparteth none of his candor to the rusty. The diseases of the minde are more taking than the diseases of the body; let us therefore take heed how wee come within the breath of a man who is of a rotten heart, and corrupt conscience. If Joseph living in Pharaohs Court learned to sweare by the life of Pharaoh, and the people of God be∣ing mingled with the heathen learned their workes: beware how you touch pitch lest you bee defiled, and bird-lime lest you bee entangled. Socrates was wont to say to Alcibiades, sometime the paragon of beauty both of body and minde, when hee met him among Gallants like himselfe, I feare not thee but thy company: and SaintAug. confes. l. 2. c. 9. Eamus, faciamus, pudet non esse impu∣dentem. Austine in his Confessions with teares complaineth of the hellish torrent of evill company, wherewith hee was carried away oftentimes, and fell into many a dangerous gulph: I had not the power to stay my selfe, saith hee, when they called; Eamus, faciamus, Let us goe, let us doe some noble exploit, or brave pranke of youth: nay, they so farre wrought upon mee, that I was ashamed of my shamefaced modesty, and blushed that I was not past blushing. You that are Gods chosen make choice of your company, let all your delight bee, with holy David,Psal. 16.3. in such as excell in vertue, and have holinesse to the Lord engraven in their breasts. For yee are Temples, therefore bee yee separate from profane persons. Yee are the Temples of the living God, meddle not therefore with dumb and dead Idols. If Idolatry bee the spirits adultery, and Gods wrath a∣gainst Idolaters is jealousie, and his jealousie burneth like fire downe to the bottome of hell; I shall not need by arguments to deterre any understan∣ding Christian from comming within the verge of so dangerous an impie∣ty, the guilt whereof lyeth not onely upon those whose soules and bodies have been agents in Idols services, but also all those who by any speeches, acts, signes, or outward gestures, give any allowance or countenance there∣unto.Amb. ep. 31. Pollui se puta∣bat si aram vi∣disset. Constantine the Emperour thought himself defiled if he had but seen an heathenish altar:Psal. 16.4. David if he had but made mention of an Idoll; their of∣ferings of bloud I will not offer, nor take their names into my mouth. Saint Paul permitted not the Corinthians to taste of any dainties that were served in at the Idols table. Let them therefore beware of some fearfull judge∣ment of God, who without any calling or commission, out of meere curio∣sity, enter into the house of Rimmon, and behold those Idolatrous rites wherewith Romish superstition hath corrupted the pure worship of God. How can they bee there with them without offence? If they joyne not with these Idolaters in censing, bowing before, offering unto, and kissing their Images, in calling upon Saints, and praying for the releasing of soules out of Purgatory, they give offence to them: if they joyne with them, they
give greater offence to the Church of God, and not onely receive aHom. against rebellion the Pope is called the Baby∣lonish beast. marke from the beast, but a grievous wound. The Corinthians, whom S. Paul in these words plucks, as it were, violently out of the idols Temple, had as co∣lorable a pretence as these Naamans can have. They pleaded that they went not to the idols temple to worship, but to make merry with their neighbors, and feede their bellies with the idols relicks; these in like manner say that they resort not to places where Masses are said to worship the wafer, or breaden god, but to feede their eyes with their garish shewes, and please their eares with their exquisite musicke. They proceeded farther in their defence, alledging that they knew the idoll was nothing, and in their eating of things offered to it, they had no relation to the Paynim deity, nor pur∣pose to worship it, but the true God, whose creatures they received with cheerefulnesse and thanksgiving. And is not this the fairest glosse they set upon their foule and scandalous practise in pressing into Popish chappels, that they know the sacrifice of the Masse is nothing, neither doe they any reverence at all to image or picture, but to God, to whom they pray against those superstitions even when they are at them? But what doth the Apostle answer to the Corinthians? viz. That though the idoll bee nothing in it selfe, yet sith it is a supposed Deity in the minde of the Idolater, who intendeth a religious worship thereunto, in keeping those heathenish feasts, a Christian may not joyne with him in the outward action of his i∣doll service (whatsoever the intention be) without receiving a foule staine both in his conscience and in his good name. To lift up the heart to God when they fall downe with their body before the Hoste or Image, will no more acquit them from idolatry, than it will cleare a woman from adul∣tery to thinke upon her husband when shee prostituteth her body to the impure soliciter of her chastity. Neither is it easie to sever the soule from the body in one and the selfe same act, asAug. confess. l. 6. c. 8. Alypius ab amicis vio∣lenter in am∣phitheat um adductus, di∣cens, si corpus meum in illum locum trahitis, numquid & a∣nimum? adero ita{que} absens, & sic & vos & illa superabo: ille diuclausis oculo∣rum foribus, in∣terdixit animae ne in tanta ma∣la procederet, utinam & aures obturasset, nam quodam pugnae casu cu∣riositate victus, aperuit oculos, & percussus est graviore vulne∣re in animâ quam ille in corpore. Alypius found by his woefull experience; who being violently drawne by his friends into the Romane Theater, thus reasoned with himselfe: What though you have drawne my body into this place? you shall not draw my soule: seeing you will have it so, I will stay with you, but I resolve to be absent when I am pre∣sent, and so I will deceive you and them. According to which his firme pur∣pose, hee kept the liddes of his eyes shut, that his soule might not, as it were, goe out of them, and gad after these vanities: And it had beene hap∣py for him, saith Saint Austine, if hee had locked up the gates of his eares also; for on the suddaine hearing a great shout and applause, ere hee was a∣ware hee opened his eyes, and by seeing that bloody spectacle received a deeper wound in his soule than the hurt Fencer in his body. Is it not to bee feared that as theGen. 30.39. And the flockes conceived before the rods, and brought forth cat∣tell ring streked, speckled, and spot∣ted. sheepe which conceived before the coloured roddes brought forth spotted lambes, so the prayers and meditations which are conceived before idols, will receive some impression from the image, and bee tainted with idolatry, or spotted with superstition? Was it unlawfull for the Corinthians to partake with idolaters in meats offered unto idols, and can it bee lawfull for these men to communicate with Papists in pray∣ers offered unto them? If they answer, they pray to Saints, and before images and not idols; let them know that any image or creature to which re∣ligious worship is given, thereby becommeth an idoll. If Saint Cyprians zeale
transported him not too farre, when hee peremptorily determineth there can bee no society betweene faith and perfidiousnesse, or betweene the true and false worship of God. If the2 Cor. 6.14. What fellowship hath righteous∣nesse with unrigh∣teousnesse? &c. Apostle alloweth of no more communion betweene Christians and Idolaters than betweene righteousnesse and un∣righteousnesse, or light and darkenesse, orVer. 15. Christ and Belial; certainely all Interimists, and Pseudo-Cassanders, and catholike Moderators of these times, who goe about to bring Christ and Antichrist to an enterview, sod∣der unity and schisme, piece faith and heresie, and make the Whore of Ba∣bylon and Christs spouse good friends, are like to have a hard taske of it. For what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? but yee are the Temple of God. Yee. The light of the sunne is common unto all, but not his influence: in like manner there are certaine enlightning gifts which are not deni∣ed to the unregenerate, but the sanctifying, and saving graces of the spi∣rit are peculiar to Gods children. God forbiddeth in the Law the annoin∣ting any thing with the holyExod. 30.33. oyle, save the things that are there specifi∣ed; he maketh it death to put that holy oyntment to any common use, and shall wee thinke that hee will shed the oyntment of his spirit into any im∣pure or prophane heart? will hee cast his pearle before swine? The pie∣ty of Paynims is Necromancy or Idolatry, of Heretickes is Will-wor∣ship, of Hypocrites is Formality, of Schismaticks is Faction. There can be no true devotion without illumination of the understanding, and renovati∣on of the will, and purifying the heart by faith; there is no Temple of God which is not built upon the corner stone Christ Jesus. Ye, and none but such as ye are. The Church in the song of Solomon is compared to aCant. 4.12. A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse a spring shut up, a foun∣taine sealed. garden en∣closed, or a fountaine sealed. The prophane and ungodly drinke not of the river of her pleasures, they taste not of her delicate fruits, they who over∣come not eat notApoc. 2.17. the hidden Manna: as they partake not of the Spouse her graces, so neither have they any right or title to her titles. They are no Temples, but rather styes; no dove-cotes, but cages of uncleane birds; no habitations for the holy Ghost, but rather haunts of uncleane spirits. They indeed live and move in God, for out of him they cannot subsist; butGal. 2.20. Ne∣verthelesse I live, yet not I but Christ liveth in me. Rom. 8 9. 2 Cor. 6.16.

Are. In the Romane Kalendar no Saints are entred till many miracles be voiced upon them after death; but in Gods Register wee finde Saints in the Church on earth, among theRom. 1.7. Romanes,1 Cor. 1.2. Corinthians,Eph. 1.1. Ephesians,Phil. 1.1. Philippians, atAct. 9.32. Lydda, and elsewhere. But what Saints, and how? Saints by calling, Saints by a holy profession, and blamelesse conversation; Saints by gratious acceptation of pious endeavours, rather than of per∣formances; Saints by inchoation, Saints by regeneration of grace, Saints by daily renovation of the inward man, Saints by devotion and dedication of themselves wholly to God, Saints by inhabitation of the holy spirit in them, which maketh them a holy Temple of the living God. In this life we are1 Cor. 3.23. Gods, for all things are yours, and you are Christs, and Christ is Gods; in the life to comeApo. 21.22.

And I saw no Temple therein, for the Lord God almigh∣ty and the Lambe are the Temple thereof. ours. Now God dwelleth with us, and is but
slenderly entertained by us; but there wee shall dwell with him, and have fulnesse of all things, yet without satiety or being cloyed there∣with. The Temple. Not the Temples, but the Temple.Gen. 1.1.  As the learned Hebrici∣ans from the construction of the noune plurall with a verb singular, as if you would say in Latine, Dii or Numina creavit, gather the trinity of per∣sons in the unity of the divine nature; so from the construction here of a singular adjunct with a subject plurall, wee may inferre the plurality of the faithfull in the unity of the Church. For wee that are many yet are truely one, many graines one bread, many sheepe one fold, many members one body, many branches one vine, many private oratories or chaplets but one Temple. The parts of the Catholike Church are so farre scattered and dissevered in place that they cannot make one materiall, yet they are so neare joyned in affection, and fast linked with the bonds of religion, that they make but one spirituall Temple. They are many soules, and must needs have as many divers naturall bodies; yet in regard they are all quick∣ned, guided, and governed by the same spirit, they make but one mysticall body, whose head is in heaven, and members dispersed over the earth. Can unity bee divided? If wee are rent in sunder by schisme and faction, Christ his seamelesse coate cannot cover us all. The Philosophers finde it in the naturall, the States-men in the politicke, and I pray God wee finde it not in the mysticall body of Christ,Cyp. de simplic. prel. A velle ra∣dium à sole, di∣visionem lucis unitas non ca∣pit, ab arbore frange ramum, fructum germi∣nare non pote∣rit, à fonte prae∣cide rivum, prorsus arescet. That division tends to corruption, and dissolution to death. Plucke a beame if you can from the body of the sunne, it will have no light; breake a branch from the tree, it will beare no fruit; sever a river from the spring, it will soone bee dryed up; cut a mem∣ber from the body, it presently dyeth; cast a pumice stone into the wa∣ter, and though it bee never so bigge, while it remaines entire, and the parts whole together, it will swimme above water, but breake it into pie∣ces, and every piece will sinke: in like manner the Church and Common∣wealth, which are supported, and as it were borne up above water by uni∣ty, are drowned in perdition by discord, dissention, schisme, and faction. It is not possible that those things which are knit by a band, should hold fast together after the band it selfe is broken. How can a sinew hold steddy the joint if it bee sprayned, or broken, or cut in sunder? Religion (beloved bre∣thren) is the band of all society, the strongest sinew of Church or Com∣monwealth; God forbid there should bee any rupture in this band, any sprayne in this sinew. The husbandman hath sowed good seede, cleane and picked in this Kingdome for more than threescore yeeres, and it hath fru∣ctified exceedingly since the happy reformation of Religion in these parts; O let no envious man sow upon it those tares which of late have sprung up in such abundance in our neighbour countries, that they have almost choaked all the good wheat. Let no roote of bitternesse spring up in our Paradise, or if it bee sprung, let authority, or at least Christian charity plucke it up. Wee are all one body, let us all have the same minde towards God, and endea∣vour to the utmost of our power toEph. 4 3. preserve the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, that our spirituall Jerusalem may resemble the old Byzanti∣um, the stones whereof were so matched, and the wall built so uniformely, that the whole City seemed to bee but one stone continued throughout. It
was the honour of thePsal. 122.3. Jerusalem is buil∣ded as a City that is compacted toge∣ther. old, let it bee also of the new Jerusalem, that it is a City at unity in it selfe. I have held you thus long in the Porch, let us now enter into the Tem∣ple. Glorious things are spoken of you, O ye chosen of God, yee are tear∣med vessels of honour, lights of the world, a chosen generation, a royall priesthood, a peculiar people, a celestiall society; yet nothing ever was or can be more spoken to Your endlesse comfort, and superexcellent glory, than that you are Children of the Father, Members of the Sonne, and Tem∣ples of the holy Ghost. Seneca calleth the world, Augustissimum Dei Tem∣plum, a most magnificent Temple of God; David, the heaven; Solomon, the Church; Saint Paul, the Elect in the Church; and in a sense not alto∣gether improper, we may tearme the world, the Temple of the Church, the Church the Temple of our bodies, our bodies the Temples of our soules, and our soules most peculiarly the Temples of the living God: because God dwelleth & remaineth in our souls, our souls in our bodies, our bodies in the Church, the Church in the world. There are many other reasons of this appellati∣on, but the Apostle dwelleth most upon this of dwelling. Where God dwel∣leth there is his Temple, but he dwelleth in our hearts by faith, we are there∣fore his Temple. If exception bee made to this reason, that dwelling pro∣veth a House, but not a Temple,Cal. in hunc lo∣cum. De homi∣ne si dicatur hic habitat, non e∣rit protinus templum, sed domus propha∣na, sed in Deo hoc speciale est, quod quem∣cunque locum suâ dignatur praesentiâ, eum sanctificat. Calvin answereth acutely, that if wee speake of the habitation of a man, wee cannot from thence conclude that the place where he abideth is a Temple: but God hath this priviledge, that his presence maketh the place wheresoever hee resideth necessarily a Temple. Whereas the King lyeth there is the Court, and where God abideth there is the Church. It might bee sayd as truly of the stable where Christ lay, as of the place where God appeared to Jacob, This is the house of God, and the gate of heaven. Here I cannot but breake out into admiration with So∣lomon, and say,1 Kin. 8.27. The heaven of heavens cannot containe thee, O Lord, and wilt thou dwell in my house, in the narrow roome of my heart? Isocrates an∣swered well for a Philosopher, to that great question, What is the greatest thing in the least?Isoc. ad Dem. . The minde, said hee, in mans body. But Saint Paul teacheth us to give a better answer, to wit, God in mans soule. And how fitly hee tearmeth here believers the Temple of God, will appeare most evidently by paralleling the inward and outward Temple of God, the Church and the soule. 1 First, Churches are places exempt from legall tenures and services, and redeemed from common uses: in like manner the minde of the faith∣full and devout Christian is after a sort sequestred from the world, and wholly dedicated to God. 2 Secondly, Temples are hallowed places, not by censing, or crossing, or burning tapers, or healing it over with ashes, and drawing the characters of the Greeke and Hebrew Alphabet, after the manner of popish consecra∣tion; but by theJoh. 17.17. Word and Prayer, by which the faithfull are also conse∣crated. Sanctifie them, O Lord, with thy truth, thy Word is truth. 3 Thirdly, Temples are places of refuge and safety; and where more safety than in the houshold of faith? God spared the City for the Tem∣ples sake, and hee spareth the whole world for the Elects sake. 4 Fourthly, the Temple continually sounded with vocall and instru∣mentall
musicke; there was continuall joy, singing, and praising God: and doth not the Apostle teach us that there isEph. 5.19. joy in the holy Ghost, and continuall melody in the hearts of beleevers? 5. Fiftly, in the Temple God was to beePhil 3.3. worshipped: and Christ teacheth that the trueJohn 4.24. worshippers of God worship him in spirit and in truth: and Saint Paul commandeth us to1 Cor. 6.20. worship and glorifie God in our body and spirit, which are his. 6. Sixtly, doe not our feet in some sort resemble the foundation, our legges the pillars, our sides the walls, our mouth the doore, our eyes the windowes, our head the roofe of a Temple? Is not our body an embleme of the body of the Church, and our soule of the queere or chancell, where∣in God is, or should be worshipped day and night? The Temple of God is not lime, sand, stone, or timber, saithLact. divin. instit. l. 5. c. 8. Templum Dei non sunt ligna & lapides, sed homo qui Dei figuram gestat, quod Templum non auro, & gemmarum donis, sed vir∣tutum muneri∣bus ornatur. Lactantius, but man bearing the image of God: and this Temple is not adorned with gold or silver, but with divine vertues and graces. If this be a true definition of a Temple, and description of the Orna∣ments thereof, they are certainly much to be blamed, who make no recko∣ning of the spirituall Temple of God, in comparison of the materiall: who spare for no cost in imbellishing their Churches, and take little care for beautifying their soules: Hoc oportet facere, & illud non omit∣tere; they doe well in doing the one, but very ill in not doing the other. It will little make for the glory of their Church to paint their rood-lofts, to engrave their pillars, to carve their timber, to gild their altars, to set forth their crosses with jewells and precious stones, if they want that precious pearle which the rich Merchant man sold all that hee had to buy: to have golden miters, golden vessels,Mat. 13.46. golden shrines, golden bells, golden snuffers and snuffe-dishes, if as Boniface of Mentz long agoe complained, Their Priests are but wooden or leaden. SaintAmb. Auro non placent quae auro non emuntur. Jnven. sat. 11. Fictilis & nul∣lo violatus Ju∣piter auro. Ambrose saith expresly, That those things please not God in, or with gold, which can bee bought with no gold. In which words hee doth not simply condemne the use of gold or silver in the service of God, no more than Saint1 Pet. 3.3. Peter doth in the attire of godly Matrons, (Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the haire, and wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparrell: but let it be in the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price,) but he & Lactantius both speak comparatively, and their meaning is, that the chief adorning of Churches is not with the beauty of colours, but of holinesse: not with the lustre of pearles and precious stones, but with the shining of good workes: not with candles and tapers, but with the light of the Word: not with sweet perfumes, but with a savour of life unto life. It will bee to little purpose to sticke up waxe lights in great abundance in their Churches, after they have put out the pure light of Gods Word, or hid it as it were under a bushell in an unknowne tongue. Rhena∣mus reporteth that hee saw at Mentz two Cranes standing in silver, into the belly whereof the Priests by a device put fire and frankin∣cense so artificially, that all the smoake and sweet perfume came out at the Cranes beakes. A perfect embleme of the peoples devotion in the Romish Church: the Priests put a little fire into them, they have little
warmth of themselves, or sense of true zeale: and as those Cranes sent out sweet perfumes out at their beaks, having no smelling at all thereof them∣selves; so these breath out the sweet incense of zealous praiers and thanks∣giving, whereof they have no sense or understanding at all, because they pray in an unknowne tongue. And so from the holy place, the Temple, I come to the Holy of holies, the owner of this holy place, the Living God. The Apostle so stileth God here in my Text, to terrifie the Corinthians from provoking him either to jealousie by their Idolatry, or to anger by their impure conversation with the Gentiles; whose gods were dead and senselesse stockes, not able to apprehend, much lesse revenge any wrong offered unto them by their worshippers; and therefore they might bee bold with them, as the Philosopher was with Hercules, putting him to his thirteenth labour in seething his dinner: and Martial with Priapus, in threatning to throw him in the fire if hee looked not well to his trees: andEras. apoph. l. 5. Jovi Olym∣pio detraxit magni ponde∣ris amiculum, dicens, aestare grave, hyeme frigidum: Aes∣culapii auream barbam de∣traxit, quod negaret deco∣rum patrem Apollinem imberbem, ip∣sum barbatum conspici. Dyonisius with Aesculapius, in cutting off his golden beard, alledg∣ing for it, that it was not fit the sonne should have a beard seeing the Fa∣ther had none: but let Christians take heed of the least provocation of the living God,Heb. 12.29. for hee is a consuming fire. A childe may play at the hole of a dead cockatrice, and a silly woman may strike a dead lion, but who dares handle a live serpent, or play with the paw of a ramping and roaring lion? how much more fearfull by infinite degrees a thing is it to fall into the hands of the living God, who with the breath of his mouth is able to blow downe the whole frame of nature, and destroy all creatures from the face of the earth! There is spirit and life in this attribute living, which comprehendeth in it all that wee can comprehend, and all that wee cannot comprehend of the Deity. For the life of God is his beeing, and his beeing is his nature, and his nature is all things. When wee call upon the living God, wee call upon the true God, the everlasting God, the Father of spi∣rits, the Author of life, the Almighty, All-sufficient, All-working God; and what is not comprised in all these? The more excellent the nature is of any thing, the more excellent is the life thereof: as is the life of beasts than of trees, of men than of beasts, of Angels than of men. What then may wee conceive of the life of God himselfe? from whence hee hath his name in Greeke, : and because it is his chiefest attri∣bute, hee most frequently sweareth by it in holy Scripture, As I live saith the Lord. This attribute, living, is applyed to God in a threefold regard: 1. To distinguish him from the false gods of the Gentiles, which were dead and senselesse stockes, bearing for the most part the image of a dead man, deified after death. 2. To represent unto us the sprightly and actuous nature of God, which is alwayes in action, and ever moving in it selfe. 3. To direct us to the Fountaine of life, from whom all life is derived into the creature by a threefold streame, of 1 Nature, 2 Grace, 3 Glory.
1 First, the true God is stiled the living God in opposition to the heathen Idols, which were without life, sense, or motion: they had eyes and saw not, eares and heard not, hands and handled not; whereas the true God hath no eyes, yet seeth; no eares, yet heareth; no hands, yet worketh all things. The heathen Idols were carried upon mens shoulders, or camels backs, as the ProphetEsa. 46.1.2.3. Esay excellently describeth the manner of their pro∣cession: but contrariwise, the true God beareth his children, and supporteth them from the wombe even to their old age, and gray haires. Mothers and nurses carry children but for a short space, God beareth his children all the dayes of their life. The heathen gods, as SaintL. 1. de civit. Dei, Ne{que} enim homines a si∣mulachtis, sed simulachra ab hominibus ser∣vabantur, quo∣modo vero co∣lebantur ut pa∣triam custodi∣rent & cives, quae suos non valuere custodi∣re custodes? Austine observeth in the siege of Troy, saved not them that worshipped them, but were saved by them from fire and spoyle; whereupon hee inferreth, What folly was it to worship such gods for the preservation of the city and countrey, which were not able to keepe their owne keepers? but the true God pre∣serveth them that serve him, and hideth them under the shadow of his wings. 2 God is called the living God, because hee is all life, hee understan∣deth and willeth, decreeth and executeth, beginneth and endeth, obser∣veth and ordereth, appointeth and effecteth all things: hee whirleth about the heavens, raiseth stormes and tempests, thundering and lightning in the aire, hee moveth upon the waters, and shaketh the pillars of the earth, hee turneth about the whole frame of nature, and setteth all creatures on work: in a word, as Trismegistus excellently expresseth this truth,, and . He potentiateth all acts, and actuateth all powers. 3 Living, because hee giveth life to all that enjoy it, and preserveth al∣so it in them to the period thereof set by himselfe. All other living crea∣tures, as they have but one soule, so they have but one life: man to whom divers Philosophers assigne three soules, hath a threefold kinde of life, 1 Vegetative, 2 Sensible, 3 Reasonable. But over and above, every faithfull man hath an estate of three lives in Gods promises: 1 The life of nature (which implyeth the former three) at our en∣trance into the world. 2 The life of grace at our entrance into the Church, 3 The life of glory at our entrance into Heaven. Nature is the perfection of every creature, grace the perfection of na∣ture, glory the perfection of grace. The life of nature is given to us to seek the life of grace, which bringeth us to the life of glory. That God is the author of the life of nature, nature her selfe teacheth;Act. 17.28. In him wee live, &c. as some of your Poets have sayd. In ipso vivimus, In him wee live, move, and have our being. That hee is the author of the life of grace, Saint John, whose name signifieth grace, testifieth;Joh. 1.2. In ipso vita erat, In him was life, and the life was the light of men, and the light shi∣ned
in darkenesse, and the darknesse comprehended it not. Lastly, that hee is the author of the life of glory, Christ who is the way, the truth, and the life, declareth, sying,Jo. 11.25. I am the resurrection and the life, whosoever belie∣veth in mee, though hee were dead, yet shall hee live. There remaineth no∣thing to the illustration of this point, but the removing of an objection which somewhat cloudeth the truth. For thus a man may argue; If God, as the Prophet speaketh, is the Well of life, in which there are the three springs abovenamed, one above the other, then is life conveighed to all creatures according to the capacity of their nature, and consequently all may truely and properly bee said to live; how then is life appropriated to God, and God by this attribute, living, distinguished not onely from fai∣ned deities, which were no creatures, but also from creatures which are not God? I grant that other creatures live, and that truely and properly. For the Angels live in heaven, the Birds in the ayre, the Fishes in the sea, Men and Beasts in the earth, the Divell and damned ghosts in hell; but none of them live the life of God: their life differeth as much from his, as their na∣ture from his. 1 His life is his nature, theirs the operation of their nature; the life of Angels is their contemplation, of Divels is their torment, of Men is their action, of Beasts their se and motion, of Plants their growth; in briefe, Hee is life, they are but living. 2 His life is his owne, he liveth of himselfe, and by himselfe, and in him∣selfe; their life is borrowed from him, as all light is from the sunne. 3 His life is infinite, without beginning or ending; their life is finite, and had a beginning, and most of them shall have an end, and all might, if he had so pleased. 4 His life is entire altogether, and perfect, theirs imperfect, growing by additio of dayes to dayes, and yeeres to yeeres. 5 His lie is immutable, theirs mutable, and subject to many alterati∣ons and changs. To drw towards an end; you heare what You are, not prophane or common houses, but the Temple; not the Temple of Divels, but of God, ye the living God: marke I beseech you what will ensue upon it. 1 If the thfull are the Temple of the holy Ghost, to robbe or spoile any of them must needs bee sacriledge in the highest degree. To assault and set open Gods house, what is it but after a sort to offer violence to God himsfe, and commit a worse burglary than that which our lawes con∣demne th death? 2 If  Saints of God are the Sanctuaries of the most High, what need they  he ungodly pursue them fearefully to flye, and basely to seeke to  person for sccour, o place for refuge? They carry a sanctuary about  of their bodies. Why should they take sanctuary who are  snctury oftentimes to save the greatest offenders from God ▪ Such a sanctuary was Noah to the old world, Lot to , Saint John to those that were in the house, Saint  were in the shippe with him. So soone as Noah left the  entr into the Arke, the world was drowned; so soone as Lot lets God  and led  Zoar, Sodome was burned with fire and brimstone
from heaven: so soone as Saint John left the bath where he met Cerin∣thus the Hereticke, and got out of the house, the house fell downe: so soon as the Christians were safe at Pella out of Jerusalem, Jerusalem was de∣stroyed. The house of Obed-Edom was blessed for having the Arke in it; and thrice happy are those houses which have many of these Temples in them. 3 If Gods chosen are his most holy Temple, they must not admit Ido∣laters into their communion, nor profane persons into their houses; for this were to set open the Church of Christ to Belial, and to entertaine Gods enemies in his owne house. 4 Are our bodies and soules the Temple, and our faculties and members the Chappels of the holy Ghost? how holy then ought wee to be in our inward and outward man? how pure in our soules, and cleane in our bo∣dies? What a horrible and abominable thing were it for a man to doe any notorious villany, or commit any filthinesse in the Church upon the Com∣munion Table? the savage Gothes, and barbarous Infidels would not doe so wickedly. Can we possibly beleeve that we are the Temple of the living God, if wee bee so dissolute, and impure, and profane as some are? Know wee not that so oft as wee sweare vainly, and use curses and execrations, wee profane Gods Temple? so oft as wee draw bloud of our brother wee pollute it? so oft as wee corrupt him wee destroy it? so oft as wee defile our bodies with fornication, or our soules with Idolatry, wee com∣mit filthinesse, and practise wickednesse in the Temple of God, in the pre∣sence of God, even under his eye? Men and brethren, in this case what shall we doe? for who hath not in some kinde or other polluted Gods holy Temple, his soule and body? Lactantius giveth us the best counsell that may bee,Lact. de ira Dei, c. ult. Mundemus hoc Templum, Let us cleanse and purifie this Temple which wee have defiled. You will say, How is this to be done? Gorrham an∣swereth you out of the Law. 1 The pavement, according to the rites prescribed by Moses, was to be broken up, and all dead mens bones cast out: let us in like manner breake up the ground of the heart, and cast all dead workes out of our consciences. 2 It was to bee swept all over, and washed: let us in like manner wash our inward Temples with tears, and cleanse them with hearty repentance, and godly sorrow for our sinnes. 3 It was to be sprinkled with bloud: let us in like manner through faith sprinkle our consciences with the bloud of the Lambe. 4 It was to bee perfumed with sweet odours and incense: let us in like manner perfume our inward Temple with zealous prayers, and sighes for our sinnes. When God shall see his Temple thus purified, his house thus pre∣pared for him, hee will returne into it, and dwell in it againe, and take de∣light in it, and enrich it daily more and more. I will locke up the gates of this Temple with the golden Key ofLact. l. de ira Dei, c. ult. Sit Deus in nobis, non in templo, sed in corde consecratus; mundemus hoc templum, quod non fumo nec pulvere, sed malis cogitati∣onibus sordi∣datur; quod non cereis ar∣dentibus, sed claritate & lu∣ce sapientiae illuminatur; in quo si Deum semper credi∣derimus habe∣re praesentem, cujus divinitati secreta mentis pateant, ita vi∣vamus ut pro∣pitium semper habeamus, & nunquam vere∣amurs iratum. Lactantius: Let God bee consecra∣ted, or set up by us, not in the Temple, but in our hearts, and let us careful∣ly cleanse this Temple, which is soyled and blacked, not with smoake and dust, but with impure thoughts and earthly desires: which is not enlight∣ned with burning tapers, but with the light and brightnesse of wisdome: in which if wee beleeve that God is continually present, to the beames of
whose divine eyes the inmost Closets of all hearts lye open: let us so live that wee may ever enjoy his favour, and never feare his wrath. Gracious Lord, who hast placed thy Tabernacle in the midst of us, in our hearts, consecrate them, wee beseech thee, for holy Temples unto thee; sprinkle them with thy bloud, cleanse them by thy grace, enligh∣ten them with thy Word, sanctifie them with thy Spirit, adorne them with thy gifts, and fill them with thy glory. O thou who dwellest in the highest heavens, come downe and visit thy lower houses, our bodies and soules, dedicated unto thee, take a lodging with us for a while in our earthly Tabernacles; and when we must leave them, receive thou us into thine everlasting habita∣tions. So be it. &c.
THE GENERALL HIS COMMISSION. A Sermon preached at S. Jones's before the right honourable the Earles of Oxford, Exeter, and Southamp∣ton; and divers other Captaines and Comman∣ders ready to take their journies into the Low-Countries, in the yeere 1621. THE EIGHTEENTH SERMON. JOSUAH 1.9. Have not I commmanded thee? bee strong and of a good courage, bee not afraid, neither bee thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest. Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. I Find this Aphorisme in the prime Writers of our com∣mon laws, Gladius gladium juvat, the one sword steeds the other: whereby is meant that the Ecclesiasticall and Temporall powers mutually ayde and assist each other; that Canons improve lawes, and lawes corro∣borate canons; that where the arme of the secular Ma∣gistrate is short in civill punishments, the ecclesiasti∣call lengtheneth it by inflicting Church censures; and againe, where the ec∣clesiastical arme is weak, the secular strengtheneth it by executing corporall punishments upon such delinquents as stand out in contempt of spirituall. The like may be said of theEphes. 6.17. spirituall and military sword, Gladius gladium exacuit, the one whets & sharpens the other. For the word of God, which is the sword of the spirit, by divine exhortations and promises sets such an edge upon the material, that Gods men of war therewith easily cut in pieces
the armour, and put to flight or death the armies of theHeb. 11.34. Out of weaknesse were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, put to flight the armies of the Aliens. Aliens. The Jewes never acquitted themselves so worthily, nor fought so victoriously, as when they received their armour out of the Temple from the Priests hands: and after Constantine the great having seen a vision in the ayre, and heard a voice from Heaven, In hoc signo vinces, set the crosse upon the Eagle in his Ensigne, his Christian souldiers marched on so courageously, and drave with such speed before them the bloudy enemies of their faith, that they might seem to bee carried by the wings of an Eagle. The anci∣ent Laced aemonians also before they put themselves in the field, had a cer∣taine Poem of Tyrtaeus read unto them; but no Verses or Sonnets of Tyr∣taeus, Pindarus, or Homer, are comparable in this respect to the Songs of Sion: no Cornets, Fifes, or Drummes in the campe sound so shrill in a Christian souldiers eares, as the silver Trumpets of the Sanctuary: no speech or oration like to a Sermon to rowze up their spirits, and put cou∣rage and valour into their hearts, who fight the Lords battels. None put∣teth on so resolutely, as hee who hath Gods command for his warrant, and his presence for his encouragement, and his Angels for his guard, and a certaine expectation of a crowne of life afterRevel. 2.10. Be faithfull unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. death for his reward. Hee cannot but be such as Josuah is here willed to be, that is strong, and of a good courage, affraid of no adverse power, dismayed with no preparations on the contrary part, appaled at no colours, no not at the wan and ghastly co∣lours of death it selfe: For ifRom. 8.31. God be for us, who can be against us; or if they be against us, hurt us? Have not I commanded thee? be strong therefore, &c. As God at the first, by breathing into man theGen. 2.7. And he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a li∣ving soule. spirit of life, made him a man; so here by breathing into Josuah the spirit of courage, hee made him a man of warre. Reason is the forme and specificall difference of a man; and fortitude and valour of a souldier: Be strong therefore, and of a good courage. This courage cannot be well grounded, unlesse it have Gods command, or at least war∣rant for the service (Have not I commanded thee?) and his presence for our aide and assistance (The Lord thy good is with thee.) If we have Gods com∣mand or allowance for the service we undertake, if we fight under his Ban∣ner, and follow his Colours, we may well be strong, and of a good courage. The HeathenOvid. fast. l. Tu pia tela fe∣res, sceleratas ille sagittas, Stabit pro sig∣nis fas{que} pium∣que tuis. Poet could say, that those who have Religion and Justice on their side, may promise themselves happy. Eras.

A good courage in a good quarrell cannot want Gods assistance, The Lord thy God is with thee. Behold here then, noble Commanders and Souldiers in the Lords bat∣tels, 1. Your commission: Have not I commanded? 2. Your duety: Be strong. 3. Your comfort, and ground of confidence: The Lord is with you. Have Gods word for your warrant, and his presence for your assi∣stance, and you cannot but bee valiant and courageous; your commission will produce courage, and your courage victory. As you are to receive commission from God, so bee strong in God, and God will bee with
you: first have an eye to your commission. Have not I commanded thee? As Moses was a lively and living type of the Law, so was Josuah of the Gospel. Moses commendeth Gods people to Josuah; the Law sendeth us to the Gospel. Moses led the people through the Wildernesse, and discovered the Land of promise from Mount Nebo, and dyed; but Josuah brought the people into it, and put them in possession thereof. The Law leadeth us in the way, and giveth us a glimpse of the celestiall Canaan; but the Gospel, by our Josuah Christ Jesus, bringeth us into it, and possesseth us of it. That which the Hebrew pronounce Jo∣suah, Saint Luke and the 70. Interpreters writeActs 7.45. Hebr. 4.8. Jesus. AndElias l. vos. Rabin. Judaei nolunt dicere  sed  quia non con∣fitentur ipsum esse salvato∣rem, possumus etiam dicere id factum esse, quia pronun∣tiatio literae ע difficilis est Gentibus. Baal Aruch in lexic. talmud. Mos linguae sy∣rae est elidere ח & ע literas. Drusius, in his Commentary upon the Hebrew words of the New Testament, out of Baal Aruch, and Elias, proveth, that Josuah and Jesus are all one name. Josuah is Jesus in the history, and Jesus is Josuah in the mystery. Josuah is typicall Jesus, and Jesus is mysticall Josuah. Here then adamas insculpitur adamante, one diamond cuts and points another. Jesus Christ instructeth and encourageth Jesus Nave, the substance formes the shadow, the face drawes the picture, the truth fitteth and accommodateth the type. As those who deale in curious stuffes that are wrought on both sides, view the flowers as well in the in-side as the out; so in the sacred context of this book, we are as well to handle and take speciall notice of the in-side as well as the out-side: the mysticall reference, as well as the historicall relation. When wee reade of Josuah, let the eye of our faith bee upon Jesus: when wee reade of his passing over Jordan, before hee gained his greatest victo∣ries, we must thinke of Jesus passing the river Cedron before his passion: when we reade of JosuahsJos. 4.8. placing 12. stones for a memoriall to the chil∣dren of Israel for ever, let us thinke of Jesus his setting 12. preciousApoc. 21.19. stones in the foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem: when we reade ofJos. 12.7. Josuahs slaying, or driving out of all the old Inhabitants of Canaan, let us thinke of Jesus his destroying theEph. 4.22. old man in us, and driving out all the native, and (if I may so speake) aboriginall sinnes out of our consciences: when wee reade of Josuahs vanquishing 31. Kings, let us thinke on Jesus his victories over sinne, hell, and death, his leading captivity captive, and subduing all principalities, and powers, and thrones, and dominions, and whatsoever lif∣teth it selfe up against his Crosse: when we reade of the Sunne standing still inJos. 10.12. Josuah his battell against the Amorites, let us thinke of the Sunnes vai∣ling himselfe, and the Heavens mourning in sables at the passion of our Sa∣viour. Lastly, when we reade of Josuahs forcible entry, and taking pos∣session of the earthly, let us meditate upon Jesus his victorious entry into the celestiall Canaan. Thus briefly of the person commanding, and the person commanded, both literally and mystically. The command it selfe is to be a valiant Com∣mander and Leader of Gods people against the Amorites, Amalekites, Je∣busites, and all the severall sorts of the Canaanites. For the clearing of which commission of Josuah, two questions are to be debated: 1. Whether warre in generall can stand with Religion. 2. Whether this warre in particular could stand with Justice.
Both are briefly resolved in one word, I: God commandeth Josuah to fight; therefore warre is lawfull: hee appointeth Josuah to command in chiefe in this warre against the Canaanites; this warre therefore was just. Yet to remove all scruples out of weake consciences, I crave leave to bring out before you, and breake in peeces those weake and dull weapons where∣with some fight against all warre and fighting in generall, and this warre in speciall. First, they alledge that Christ our Lord is stiled the Prince of peace, that his Spouse, the Church, is said to have nothing red about her but her lips; which are described to bee ruddy, because all her discourse is of Christs bloudy passion. Secondly, by the Christian law, say they, wee must rather dye than kill, rather patiently suffer our owne bloud to bee spilt, than spill any others: if we must render to no man evill for evill, nor rebuke for rebuke, much lesse blows for blows: they that smite with a sword, shallMat. 26 52. perish with a sword. Thirdly, they labour also to make the ancient Fathers on their parts, and by name Lactantius, and Cyprian.Lactant. diin. . Si qu  ho∣min gula∣ver  n∣ta  ac ato be∣tur, nd te∣e hoc do∣micilium eum admittifas pu∣tant: ille au∣tem qui infinita hominum mil∣lia trucdave∣it, cruore cam∣pos inundave∣rit, slumina in∣fecerit, non modo in Tem∣plu sed etiam in coelum ad∣mittitur. Lactantius argueth thus: If any man cut the throat of one man alone, he is taken for a nefarious malefactor and bloudy murtherer, and shut out of the house of God on earth: and shall he who hath been the death of many millions, who hath coloured the rivers with mans bloud, and made an inundation thereof in many pitched fields, not only be ad∣mitted into the Temple, but into Heaven? And SaintCypr. ep l. 2. Madet orbis mutuo sangui∣ne, & homici∣dium cum ad∣mittant singuli cmen est. vir∣ts vorat i cum publicè petitu. Cyprian pursueth the same argument: The world, saith hee, swimmeth with mans bloud, and mur∣der, if it bee committed by single men, or one by one, is a hainous crime; but an heroicall vertue, when by publike authority thousands of men are misera∣bly slaughtered. Can hee be a good Warriour, who is taught to seeke peace and ensue it; if his enemies strike him on the right hand, to turne the left; if he compell him to follow him one mile, to accompany him two? With these weapons certaine cowardly Heretickes warre against all warre, and sharpen their pens against the sword: but they are easily beat backe. As Christ is stiled the Prince of peace, so God is in holy Scripture every where honoured with the title of the Lord of hosts; and the Spouse of Christ is described to be terrible as anCant. 6.4. Army with banners. It follow∣eth not, that because Christian Religion perswadeth patience, that there∣fore it abates courage: that because it forbiddeth private revenge, there∣fore publike justice: because it condemneth bloudy cruelty, therefore martiall prowesse. Hee which striketh with a sword, unlesse lawfull au∣thority put it into his hand, shall perish with a sword; but where God and his Vicegerent putteth a sword into our hands, wee must smite with it, or wee deserve to be smitten with it. Wee must seeke peace, and ensue it by all meanes; whereof one, and that a most powerfull one, and sometimes the onely one, is by managing a just warre. And therefore, as Saint Jerome, though otherwise hee seem partiall for virginity against marriage, yet in this respect hee preferreth marriage, because it begets virgins: in like manner those who are most averse from warre, must yet hold with it in this respect, because oftentimes nothing but a good sword can make a sure and settled peace. And therefore though in the first building of the Temple there were no noise of any iron toole, yet in the second they built with their
Nehem. 4.13. tooles in one hand and their sword in the other. And doe wee not reade, that the servants of God byHebr. 11.33. faith have subdued Kingdomes? Was it not fore-told of them, that they should binde Kings in chaines, and Nobles in linkes of iron, to execute upon them the judgement written, This honour have all hisPsal. 149.8, 9. Saints? Doth not the Kingly Prophet David by the spirit give them the word, Arme, arme: Let the high praises of God be in their mouths,Ver. 6. and a two edged sword in their hands? If Saint John Baptist had judged the profession of a souldier incompatible with the calling of a Christian, when his souldiers came unto him, and demanded of him what they should doe, hee would have returned them this short answer, Quit your calling, and throw away your armour, and undertake another profession: but on the contrary, he allowing their calling, directeth them how to demeane them∣selves in it, saying, DoeLuke 3.14. violence to no man, nor accuse any falsly, and be con∣tent with your wages. Christian Religion is purest of all religions from all staine of bloud. A Christian Commander would more heartily wish than ever Antonius did, Utinam possem multos ab inferis revocare; I would it were in my power to restore those to life, whom the sword hath devoured: but when the onely meanes to save the life-bloud about the heart, is to let out some of the corrupt bloud in other parts, hee is a cruell Physician that will n pricke a veine. When the right of a Crowne, when the honour of the Ste, when the Common-wealth, and every mans private fortunes, when Riion and our Faith lyeth on bleeding, not to use the speediest meanes that y bee to drive away Usurpers, Invaders, Rebells, Traitors, and other bloud-suckers, is bloudy cruelty, and which is worst of all, cruelty to our selves and our own bowels. To conclude, if any upon what pretext soeve shall cast a blurre upon the noble & honourable profession of a soul∣dier, he goeth about not onely to take off the Garland from the heads of all Davids Worthies, but also the Crowne from David himselfe, and Con∣stantine the great, and Theodosius, and many other the most glorious Prin∣ces that ever swayed mortall Scepters. All that Christianity requireth in waging warre, is comprised in that golden sentence of Saint Austin, Esto bellando pacificus; Be thou a peace-maker even in warring, warre with peace, warre for peace. Warre with peace, being perswaded in thy conscience of the lawfulnesse of the quarrell, and beare no private malice, nor bloudy minde towards thine enemy: conquer him as fairely as thou canst; and let this be the end of taking up armes, that armes may be safely laid downe on all hands And that warres especially thus managed are lawfull and warrant∣able even among Christians, none but braine-sicke Anabaptists doubt: But what kinde of warres are lawfull, is a point not so soone determined. Some are meerly for defensive warres, Ovid. l. 1. Fa∣storum.Sola gerat miles quibus arma coerceat arma. And that such warres are lawfull Nature her selfe teacheth:Cic. pro Mi∣lunc. Est enim haec non scrip∣ta sed nata lex, ad quam non docti sed facti, non instituti, sed imbuti su∣mus. This is a law written in the heart of all men, to repell force with force, and beat backe armes with armes; therefore defensive armes need no apology or defence. Offensive armes are allowed by the Oratour in two cases, onely pro fide & salute, when the safety, or honour of the State requires either to right
or to save our selves. Christian Religion is not so strait-laced, But main∣taineth all warres to be just, when they are necessary; and to judge when they are necessary, belongeth to the soveraigne power of the State, in whomsoever it resideth, either in the Prince, as in all free Monarchies; or in the Senate and prime men, as in an Aristocratie; or the major part of the people, as in a Democratie. It may bee said that no necessity can bee pre∣tended to invade a forraine country, and root out all the natives and inha∣bitants, and settle our selves in their places, which was Josuah and Israels case: How then was this warre lawfull? The answer hereunto is two-fold. First, that the Israelites title was good to the Land of Canaan by the donation of God himselfe, for more than foure hundred yeeres before this time. Secondly, Josuah had a speciall command from God himselfe, to root out the Canaanites, and to plant Gods people in their room. Therefore as he had good warrant to undertake this war, so he had great reason to pursue & manage it valiantly. For where God giveth  he giveth ; where God giveth authority to doe a thing lawfully, there hee giveth power to doe it effectually. Be strong, and of a good courage. In these words the Lord of hosts in∣spireth Josuah the Generall of his Army with the spirit of fortitude and courage, to performe this noble service, to settle his people in their long promised inheritance: hee exhorteth them to put on a resolution to ad∣venture upon all dangers, to breake through all difficulties, and contemne all terrours in the accomplishment of this honourable worke. Be strong, and of a good courage, there are the positive acts; Be not affraid, nor dis∣mayed, there are the privative acts of Christian fortitude: strength taketh away feare, courage dismayednesse; be strong in body, and of good courage in minde; or be strong in thy selfe, and couragious against thy enemies: bee not surprized with any inward feare, nor dismayed with any outward ter∣rour. For I am the Lord, and can; I am thy God, and will be thy guard and convoy in all thy wayes whithersoever thou shalt goe. Fortitude and magna∣nimity is one of the cardinall vertues consisting in a mediocrity, or middle temper of the minde, between audacious temerity, and timorous cowar∣dize. It is usually divided into two kindes: 1. Fortitudinem in ferendo: Fortitude in bearing. 2. Fortitudinem in feriendo: Fortitude in attempting, or assailing. The former is the glory of the Martyrs, the later the crowne of Chri∣stian souldiers; both are requisite to make up the perfect entire vertue of Christian fortitude, which must have as well a backe of patience to endure all hardnesse, as an edge of valour or courage, to set upon all difficulties, and goe through all dangers, not sticking at death it selfe, , the king of all feares. This vertue is called in Greeke, , from , from a word signifying a man, as manhood in our Language, to inti∣mate, that it is the most proper vertue of a man; and that hee is not a man, who is not manly and couragious in Gods cause, and his Countries. De∣generes
animos timor arguit, Fearefulnesse is an argument of a base minde, but valour is the proper ornament of a generous spirit; which hath beene alwayes held in that esteeme in the world, that all trophees, triumphs, obe∣liskes, coats of armes, and other ensignes of honour have beene appropria∣ted to this vertue, and that deservedly. For all otherCic. pro Mure∣na. Omnes ar∣tes latent sub tutelâ rei belli∣cae. arts and professions whatsoever, lye under the safe protection of it. In which regard Fulvius re∣moved the images of the nine Muses out of a Chappell in Ambracion, and placed them in Hercules Temple at Rome; to shew that as armes need the commendation of arts, so all arts stand in neede of the defence of armes. To this vertue wee owe our liberty, our honour, our wealth, our state: upon which premisses the Oratour inferreth this conclusion;Cic. pro Mu∣ren. Cedat sty∣lus gladio, um∣bra soli, sit{que} illa virtus in ci∣vitate prima, per quam fit ip∣sa civitas omni∣um princeps. Let therefore the pen give place to the sword, arts to armes, the shade to the sunne, and let that vertue have the preheminency in the State, by which the State it selfe getteth the precedency of all other; let that rule in the city, by which the city hath obtained the rule of the whole world. The great Philosopher Aristo∣tle seemeth to subscribe to this conclusion: for in martialling morall ver∣tues in their order, hee giveth magnanimity the first place: and hee yeel∣deth this reason for it; the more difficult and dreadfull the subject, the more excellent the vertue which regulates the affection about it: now death is the chiefe of all feares, magnanimity therefore which conquereth this feare is the Prince of all vertues. As the strength of a blade is tryed by the hardnesse of the matter which it cutteth, bee it wood, stone, or me∣tall: so the excellency of vertue is seene in the difficulty of the object a∣bout which it is conversant; and what so difficult as willingly to hazzard our life, & contemne death? If reason can work this in a morall man, shall not religion much more in a Christian? If fame, & a garland of flowers, and a small donative can produce noble thoughts & resolutions in heathen, shall not immortall glory, and an incorruptible garland, and hope of an immar∣cessible crowne breed more generous resolutions in those who have given their names to the Lord of Hosts, to fight his battels? especially conside∣ring that valour and courage, as it is more honourable, so it is safer than base feare. For it strikes a terrour in the hearts of the enemies, and of∣ten times winnes a victory without striking a blow. And as our courage maketh the enemies fearefull, so our timorousnesse maketh them valorous; our trembling at danger bringeth more danger upon us, by making us un∣able to resist. For this cowardly affection worketh not onely upon the soule, but upon the body also; and as it dejecteth and dis-armeth the one, so it dis-ableth and weakeneth the other. But the strongest motive to for∣titude, and most effectuall incentive to courage, and surest ground of confi∣dence, is that which now followeth in the last place. The Lord thy God is with thee whither soever thou goest. The Lord, whose command is universall; God, whose power is invincible; The Lord thy God, whose mercies are incomprehensible, is with thee whither soever thou goest. If the Lord thy God bee with thee, his wisedome is with thee to direct thee, his power to protect thee, his strength to support thee, his goodnesse to maintaine thee, his bounty to reward thee, his word to encourage thee, and, if thou dye under his banner, his Angels presently to carry thee into heaven. Where the Israelites lamentably deplore their ill successe in war,
they attribute it to Gods absence,Psal. 44 9. & 60.10. Thou goest not forth, say they, with our armies. And to the end that they might be more assured of Gods presence with them in their battels, they carryed the Arke of God with them, and were wont to aske counsell of him before hand, touching the successe of their warre; and in ancienter times the Priests gave answer from God by the Ephod: but in the latter, if we may believeJoseph. antiq. Judaic. Josephus, they ghessed at the event by the glaring or duskinesse of the Diamond on the Priests breast-plate. For if it shined brightly and cleerely, it foreshewed certaine victory; but if it changed the colour, or lost any thing of the lustre, it portended ill successe. The Lacedaemonians being overtaken by the Persian horse, and overwhelmed with great flights of arrowes, did notwithstan∣ding quietly sit still, without making any resistance at all, or defence, till the sacrifices for victory were happily ended; yea though many were sore hurt, and some slaine out right before any good signe appeared in the entrailes: but as soone as their Generall Pausanias had found good tokens of victo∣ry, and perswaded his souldiers of the divine approbation of their warre, they arose, and with excellent courage first received the charge of the Bar∣barians, and after charged them afresh, and slew Mardonius the Persian Generall, and many thousands of the rest, and got the day. If the conje∣cturall hope of the aide and assistance of a fained deity put such courage and resolution into the Lacedaemonians, shall not faith in the true God, and confidence in his helpe, breede better blood, and infuse nobler spirits into the hearts of Gods warriours, and Christian souldiers? God can save his, and overcome the enemy, as well with small forces as with great; but all the forces in the world without him have no force at all. Therefore though Captaines have many employments, yet they must looke especi∣ally to hoc unum necessarium, this one thing most needfull, That they have God on their side, that they make him sure for them. You will say, I know, How may this bee done? How may hee bee wrought and made thorough for us? Hee sheweth at the 7. & 8. verses. Observe to doe accor∣ding to all the Law which Moses my servant commanded thee: turne not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou maist prosper whithersoever thou goest. This booke of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou maist observe to doe according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous: and then thou shalt have good successe. First, the Lords Josuah's must looke strictly to their life and conversati∣on, so much the rather by how much in battell they are nearer death; which points to them in every sword and speare, and giveth them a sum∣mons at the report of every Cannon, and discharging of every Piece. Secondly, they must looke to their companies and troupes, and see that there bee never an Achan among them, never a sacrilegious, prophane, or abominable person, whose horrible crimes, if they bee not discovered and punished, may prove the losse of many a battell, and the ruine of a whole army. The Barbarians hands, saith SaintBarbari no∣stris vitiis for∣tes sunt. Jerome, are made strong against us by our grievous transgressions; our infirmities are our enemies greatest strength, our distractions their security, our crying sinnes their thunde∣ring ordnance.Sal. l. 4. de pro∣vid. Salvianus acknowledgeth that it was just with God to
strengthen the armies of the Gothes and Vandals, though they were here∣tickes, against the right beleeving Romanes, because those barbarous nati∣ons observed most strict discipline, and lived more chastly and temperate∣ly than the Romane souldiers. Lastly, when you put on your corporall armour, forget not to put on the spirituall, laid out for you by the Apostle, and gilt by his divine elo∣quence; I meane,Eph. 6.14, 15, 16, 17. The breast-plate of righteousnesse, the shooes of prepara∣tion, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit. Learne of that fortunate Commander of the Gothes, who, like lightning, in a moment appeared from one part of the earth to the other, and no∣thing was able to withstand him. This Emperour never put himselfe into the field to fight with his enemy, before at home hee had made his peace with God. Salvianus, who lived at the same time, and accurately obser∣ved his demeanour, attributeth his miraculous victories to nothing more than to his extraordinary and admirable devotion.Sal. de prov. l. 7. Ipse rex hostium usque ad diem pug∣nae, stratus ci∣licio preces fundit, ante bellum in ora∣tione jacuit, ad bellum de ora∣tione surrexit. The King that war∣reth against us, to the very day in which hee draweth out his forces to fight, ly∣eth on the ground at his devotion in sackcloth and ashes; before hee goeth into the battell hee is at his prayer in private, and never riseth but from his knees to fight. Wrestle you in like manner with God, that you may bee Israels; keep his Law as strictly as your Martiall discipline, and I will be bold to give you now at your parting the benediction of the Psalmist:Psal. 45.3, 4. Gird your swords upon your thighes, O yee mighty, with glory, ride on with honour, be∣cause of truth, meeknesse, and righteousnesse, and your right hand shall teach you terrible things; your arrowes shall bee sharpe in the heart of the Kings e∣nemies, whereby the people shall fall under you. Hath not the Lord by his Vice-gerent commanded you to help and assist your brethren? Bee strong therefore, and of a good courage, and the Lord God shall bee with you whithersoever you goe. To whom, &c.
THE CROWNE OF HUMILITY. A Sermon preached in VVooll-Church, Aprill 10. 1624. THE NINETEENTH SERMON. MATTH. 5.3. Blessed are the poore in spirit: for theirs is the Kingdome of Heaven. THey who desire to abide in the Tabernacle of the Al∣mighty, and rest upon his holyPsal. 15.1. Hill, had need to get by heart, and con without booke by continuall practice this Sermon of Christ upon the Mount: which hath more ravishing straines of Eloquence, more divine a phorismes of Wisedome, more powerfull motives to Holinesse, more certaine directions to Happinesse treasured up in it, than are found in all the parenetiques of Oratours, all the diatribes of Phi∣losophers, all the apophthegmes of Sages, all the emblemes of Poets, all the hieroglyphicks of Egyptian Priests, all the tables of Lawes, all the pan∣dects of Constitutions, all the digests of Imperiall Sanctions, all the bodies and systemes of Canons, all acts of Parliament, all rules of Perfection ever published to the worlds view. I dare confidently affirme, that which all the ancient and later Commentatours upon it will make good, that this one Sermon in Monte surmounts them all. Ubi desinit Philosophus, ibi incipit Medicus; Where the Philosophers left and could goe no further, the Phy∣sician of our soule goes on, at the health and eternall salvation of our im∣mortall spirit: where they made an end of their discourses, which yet came farre short of their marke, there hee begins, at blessednesse it selfe. And
doubtlesse, if there be any happinesse in knowledge, it is in the knowledge of happinesse; which the proper owner thereof in himselfe, and gracious doner to his creatures capable thereof, bestoweth here as a dowry, and sha∣reth betweene eight divine vertues. 1. Humility: poore in spirit. 2. Repentance: mourning for sinne. 3. Compassion: ever meeke. 4. Devotion: hungring and thirsting for righteousnesse. 5. Piety: alwaies mercifull. 6. Sincerity: pure in heart. 7. Brotherly love: making peace. 8. Patience: enduring all for righteousnesse sake: There are no straines in Musicke so delightfull, as those in which dis∣cords are artificially bound in with concords; nor dishes so dainty, as those in which sweet things, and tart or sowre are seasonably mingled: nor pi∣ctures so beautifull, as those in which bright colours with darke shadowes are curiously tempered: nor sentences so rhetoricall, as those in which con∣traries are fitly opposed, and set one against the other. Such are almost all the straines of this sweet Lesson pricked by our Saviour, such are all the dishes placed in this heavenly Banquet, such are the pictures set in this Gal∣lery, such are the sentences skilfully contrived into the Proeme of this Ser∣mon; wherein blessing is opposed to cursing, laughing to weeping, reward to punishments, satisfaction to hungring and thirsting, gaine to losses, glory to shame, and (in my Text) heavenly riches to earthly poverty. 1. Blessed poverty, because to be enriched. 2. Blessed mourning, because to be comforted. 3. Blessed hungring, because to be satisfied. 4. Blessed enduring punishment, because to be rewarded. Blessed are the poore, &c. In these words our blessed Saviour, the hope of our blessednesse here, and blessednesse of our hope hereafter, teacheth us, 1. Whom we are to call blessed. 2. Why. 1. Whom, the humble in heart, here tearmed poore in spirit. 2. Why, because their lowlinesse of mind entituleth them to the highest top of honour, glory, and happinesse, a Kingdome, and that in Heaven. Blessed, not in fruition, but in hope, are the poore, not simply in estate, but in spirit: and these are also blessed, not for any thing they have on earth, but for that they shall have in heaven, an incorruptible Crowne of glory. 1. There are some to be held for blessed even in this life. 2. These blessed are the poore. 3. These poore are poore in spirit. Or if you like better of a Logicall division, than a Theologicall par∣tition,
observe in this speech of our Saviour, 1. An affirmation, Blessed are the poore. 2. A confirmation, For theirs is the kingdome of Heaven. The affirmation is strange, and may be called a divine Paradoxe: for the world accounteth blessednesse to consist in wealth and abundance; not in poverty. A good man, in the language of the City, is a wealthy man. Po∣verty above all things is despised: Juv sat. 3.Nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se, Quam quod ridiculos homines facit. And of all poore men we have the meanest opinion of those that are poore in spirit, we account not them worth the earth they tread upon; yet for these Christ plats the Garland of blessednesse. Because the affirmation is strange, the confirmation ought to be strong; and so indeed it is: For, saith hee, theirs is the Kingdome of Heaven. Whether wee take the Kingdome of Heaven for the Kingdome of grace, or the Kingdome of glory, they have best right to both. For the Kingdome of grace is in them, according to the words of our Saviour,Luk. 17.21. The Kingdome of God is with you: and they shall be in the Kingdome of glory when they enter into their Masters joy; & there∣fore they are doubly happy: 1. Re. 2. Spe. 1. Re, in the present possession of the Kingdome of grace: and 2. Spe, in the certaine expectation of the Kingdome of glory. O how is the world out in her accompt! She esteemeth them the onely miserable, who indeed are the onely happy: she deemeth them the off-scou∣ring of all things, who shall shine as starres in the Firmament: shee accoun∣teth them beggars and forlorne men, who areApoc. 1.6. And hath made us Kings and Priests unto God. Kings to God, and so assured of a celestiall Crowne, that Christ saith not theirs shall bee, but theirs is the kingdome of Heaven, as if they now ware it. When one of Apelles his scholars had drawne Helena in costly and gorgeous apparell, hung all over with orient pearle, and resplendent stones; O young man, saith he, because thou couldest not paint Helena faire, her naturall feature being above thy art, thou hast drawne her rich: in like manner may we say truely, that be∣cause the Heathen Philosophers (whose severall opinions amount unto the number of some hundreds, as Saint Austin relateth in his bookes of the City of God, and striketh a dash of his pen through them all) could not describe their summum bonum, or chiefe happinesse beautifull; because they wanted the eye of faith to descry the beauty of the1 Pet. 3.4. hidden man of the heart, they like the young man thought to make amends by painting her rich, aboun∣ding with all outward comforts and contentments, houses, possessions, trea∣sures, attendants, pleasures, honours: but our blessed Saviour contrariwise, because he could not set her forth rich in estate here (forMat. 8.20. The son of man hath not where to y his head. hee had not him∣selfe to lay his head upon) hee describeth her most faire and beautifull, likePsal. 45.13. Solomons Queen, all glorious within. Hath not God chosen theJam. 2.5. poore of this world rich in faith, to bee heires of his Kingdome? Yes certainly: for Christ
not onely affirmeth them to bee blessed, saying, Blessed are the poore; but also confirmes it with a most forcible reason, For theirs is the Kingdome of Heaven. Upon which Scripture all my observations for the present shall levell at three points: 1. Blessednesse. 2. Poverty in spirit. 3. Kingdome of Heaven. First I will demonstrate, that the Saints of God enjoy a kinde of blessed∣nesse in this life. Secondly, that this blessednesse consisteth especially in their right to a crowne in heaven. Thirdly, that this right is in the poore in spirit. Blessed are. They who observe the changings and turnings of this mor∣tall life, and in them consider how wretched man, like a Tennis-ball, is beat from wall to wall, & as it were racketted from one trouble to another, from one care to another, from one exigent to another, may easily ghesse at the reason why the ancient Sages termed himMelancthon chron. ludum deorum, the gods game or sport. For as Tiberus Constantinus in the yeer of our Lord 577.John Don psed. Mart commanding a golden cross set in Marble to be digged up, that it might not be trod upon, found under it a second, and under the second a third, and under the third a fourth; so the dearest servants of God in this world digging for the hidden treasure of the Gospel, find crosse under crosse, and losse upon losse, & sor∣rowes after sorrowes. Looke how the waves in the sea ride one upon the necke of the other, and like as Jobs messengers trod one upon the heeles of another; so miseries, and calamities, and vexations in the course of this life follow close one upon the other. The vanity of youth presseth upon the folly of childhood, and the ambition of ripe yeers immediately succeedeth the folly of youth, and infirmities of old age seize on the ambition of per∣fect age, and the terrours of death make haste after all. Wee runne in the race of our life as it were in a ring of misery, from inward evills to out∣ward, and from outward to inward, from diseases of body to maladies of minde, and from those to these; from feares to cares, and from cares to feares, from temporall losses to spirituall, and from spirituall backe againe to temporall, which are so many and so grievous, that whosoever is sensi∣ble of them, cannot but acknowledge this present life to bee miserable: and if hee bee not sensible of them, hee is to be accounted so much the more miserable, because hee hath lost common sense, as SaintAug. de civit. Dei, l. 19. c. 7. Haec mala tam magna, tam horrenda, tam saeva quisquis cum dolore considerat mi∣seriam necesse est fateatur, quisquis autem considerat, vel patitur ca sine animi dolote, multo utique miserius, ideò se putat bea∣tum, quia hu∣manum perdi∣dit sensum. Austin nimbly wieldeth this two-edged sword against the Heathen Philosophers that do∣ted upon worldly happinesse. Polycrates, who would not seale the truth concerning the vanity and uncertainty of worldly happinesse with his ring, which hee purposely threw in the sea, that hee might lose it, but regained it againe out of the mouth of a fish sold in the Market, and brought into his Kitchin: yet afterwards hee signed it with his bloud, when the date of his happy fortunes were out, and the crosse fell in the end to bee his lot. And Croesus, who derided Solon, preaching to him this doctrine, as hee sate upon his throne at Sardis, afterwards taken prisoner by Cyrus, and condemned to the fire, proclaimed it upon the pile now ready to bee kindled, crying out upon Solon,Herod. Clio. O Solon, Solon, I finde thy words to
bee Oracles, and thy Paradox to bee an Axiome: —dicique beatus Ante obitum nemo supremaque funera debet. that no man ought to bee entred in the Kalendar of the Blessed, before we see what end hee maketh, whether the glorious light of his temporall pro∣sperity goe not out in an obscure and stinking snuffe of a miserable and in∣famous death. Reason easily perswadeth, but Religion compelleth our assent to this truth. For Christianity is aTertuln a olog. Hoc quod Christia∣ni sumus fidei & speires est. meer matter of faith and hope: Wee walke2 Cor. 5.7. here by faith, and not by sight, our life is hidColos 3.3, 4. with Christ in God: when Christ who is our life shall appeare, then shall wee also appeare with him in glory. By hope wee are saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, why should he hope for it? If this hope were confined to this life, then were the best Christians of all men the most1 Cor. 15.19. If in this life o ely we have hope in Christ, then are we of all men most m serable. miserable. How then doth our Saviour here crown eight sorts of Christians with a title of Blessedness, and those who make least shew of it (viz.) the poore in spirit, mourners, hungry, thirsty, persecuted, reviled, cursed persons? To cleare the meaning of our Saviour, it will bee requisite briefly to de∣clare, first, how man is capable of blessednesse at all: secondly, how farre in this life, truly termed by St. Austin the region of death. Blessednesse is a soveraigne attribute of God, and asNyss hom de at. Nyssen teacheth, primarily, and absolutely, and eternally belongeth to him onely. Creatures are blessed but in part, derivatively, and at the most from the terme of their creation. Beauty first shineth in the living face and countenance; that which is resembled in the image or picture, is but a secondary, or relative beauty: in like manner, saith hee, the primary blessednesse is in God, or to speake more properly, is God himselfe; the blessednesse which is in man made after Gods image, is but a secondary blessednesse. For as the image is, such is his beauty and blessednesse; but the image of God in man since his fall is much soiled and defaced, and consequently, his blessednesse is very im∣perfect and obscure. Yet they that rubbe off the dust of earthly cares, and dirt of sinne, and by spirituall exercises brighten the graces of God in their soule, as they are truly, though not perfectly beautifull within; so they may be truly, though not absolutely stiled blessed even in this life. 1. First, because they are assured of Gods love, and they see his coun∣tenance shine upon them, which putteth morePsal 4.7. gladnesse into their heart, than is or can be in the heart of them whose corne and wine is increased. For if it bee deservedly accounted the greatest happinesse of a subject to bee in continuall grace with his Prince, what is it to bee a Favourite of the King of kings? 2. Secondly, because they have an1 Pet. 1.4. inheritance incorruptible and unde∣filed, and that fadeth not away, reserved in the heavens for them. A great heire, though hee may sometimes pinch for maintenance, and bee driven to hard exigents; yet hee still solaceth himselfe with this hope, it will bee better with mee, and I shall one day come to my lands: and such comfort have all Gods Saints in their greatest perplexities and ex∣tremities.
3. Thirdly, because they enjoy the peace of a good conscience, which Solomon calleth a continuall feast. And Saint Paul a cause of2 Cor. 1.12. For our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our conscience. Rom. 8.28. triumph and joy. 4. Fourthly, because all things work together for their good, and tend to their eternall happinesse. The joyes of the wicked are grievous, their plea∣sures are paine unto them: but on the contrary, the sorrowes of the righ∣teous are joyous, and the paines which they endure for Christ are pleasures unto them. The gaines of the worldly are indeed losses unto them, because they help on their damnation; whereas the losses of the godly are gaine and advantage unto them, because they further their salvation. 5. Fifthly, because they enjoy God (wherein consisteth the happinesse of a man) in some measure and degree even in this life. For it cannot be denied, but that devout Christians, even whilest the soule resides in the body, have a comfortable fruition of the Deity (whose favour is better than life) by faith in the heart, by knowledge in the understanding, by charity in the will, by desire in the affections, by sight in the creatures, by hearing in the Word, by taste in the Sacraments, by feeling in the inward motions and operations of Gods Spirit, which fill them with exceeding and unspeaka∣ble joy and comfort. SaintApoc. 21. John setting forth the blessednesse of the triumphant Church, and depainting the joyes of Heaven in golden colours, describeth a City situate in Heaven, whose temple is God, and light the Lambe, and walls Salvation, and courts praise, and streets gold, and foundations gemmes, and gates pearles, twelve in number, in a relation to the Lambes twelve Apo∣stles. Answerable to the gates in price, though not in number, are the steps up to them, which our Saviour (who is the way) directeth us unto: they are eight in number, made of so many whole pearles, that is, divine Vertues. 1. The first step is humility, poore in spirit, upon which when we stand, we may easily get upon the next, godly sorrow, mourning for sinne: none so apt to mourne for their sinnes, and humble themselves under the mighty hand of God in sackcloth and ashes, as the poore in spirit. 2. When we are upon this step, we readily get up upon the next, which is tender compassion and meeknesse: none so compassionate and meeke to∣wards others, when they slip into the mire of sinne, as those who continu∣ally bewaile their fowle falls, and wash their defiled soules with their teares. 3. When we are upon this third step, we may soone get up the fourth, which is hungering and thirsting for righteousnesse: for those who are most sensible of their owne wants, and continually bewaile their corruptions, and are compassionately affected towards others when they are overtaken with any temptation, must needs hunger and thirst for righteousnesse both in themselves and others. 4. When we are upon this fourth step, we may soone climbe up to the other three; Mercy the fifth, Purity the sixth, and Peace the seventh: for they who eagerly pursue righteousnesse, shall certainly meet with these three her companions. Lastly, they who have attained unto righteousnesse, and are enamoured with her three companions, Mercy, Purity, and Peace, will suffer any thing
for their sake, and so ascend up the highest step of Christian perfection, which is constant patience, and zealous striving for the truth, even unto bloud, which is not only saved, but cleansed also by being spilt for Christs sake. The lowest greece or staire, and the first step to Heaven is poverty in spirit, that is, as the Fathers generally interpret, Humility: which is the ground-colour of the soules beautifull images the graces of the spirit. The ground-colours are darke and obscure, yet except they be first laid, the wooll or stuffe will not receive, much lesse retaine the brighter and more beautifull. Such is lowlinesse of minde, of no great lustre and appearance in itselfe; yet without it no grace or vertue will long keep colour, and its beauty: and therefore Christ first layes it, saying, Blessed are the Poore in spirit. These poore in spirit are not to bee understood poore in spirituall graces, such cannot come neere the price of the Kingdome of Heaven: and therefore the spirit adviseth them under the type of the Church ofApoc. 3.18. Laodicea, to buy of him gold tryed in the fire, that they may bee rich, &c. nor are they necessarily poore in state, much lesse such as are poore in state onely: for bare poverty, yea though it bee voluntary, is but a weake plea, and giveth a man but a poore title to a Kingdome in Heaven. Wee heare indeed in the Gospel of Lazarus theLuke 16.22. Beggar in Heaven, but wee finde him there in the bosome of rich Abraham, to teach us, as Saint Austine noteth, that neither the poverty of the one brought him thither, nor the wealth of the other kept him from thence.John 14.2. In my Fathers house, saith our Saviour, there are many mansions; some for the rich, some for the poore, some for noble, some for ignoble, some forAgapet. ad Justin. . kings, some for beg∣gars: and it is hard to say, whethers crowne in Heaven shall be more mas∣sie, and be set with more orient jewells, the rich mans, who is also rich in God, or the poore mans, who is poore for God: the wealthy, who hath given much to Christ, or the needy, who hath lost all for his sake: the no∣ble and honourable man, who by his birth and place hath innobled the Christian faith, or the ignoble, who hath preferred the ignominy of Christs crosse to all the honours of this world: the King, who layeth downe his scepter at the foot of Christs crosse, or the Beggar, who taketh up his crosse, and readily followeth Christ. It is true which SaintCypr. de laps. Multos patri∣monia pondere suo depresse∣runt in teram. Cyprian chargeth many of the rich in his time with, that their great patrimonies, and large revenues of their lands, with the weight thereof pressed them downe to the earth, nay, some to hell. But the fault was in their minde, not in their meanes; in their desires, not in their fortunes or estates. For as when a man taketh a heavie Trunke full of plate or mony upon his shoulders, it crooketh his back, and boweth him down toward the earth; but if the same weight be put under his feet, it lifteth him above ground: in like maner if we put our wealth and riches above us, preferring them to our salvation, they will presse us downe to the ground, if not to hell with their weight; but if wee put them under our feet, and tread upon them as slaves to us, and quite con∣temne them in respect of heavenly treasure, they will raise us up towards heaven. As they did Job, who made so many friends of unrighteous Mam∣mon, that every eye that saw him blessed him. As they did Mary Magda∣len, whose name is and shall bee like an oyntment powred out to the end of the world, because shee brake an Alabaster boxe of most costlyMatth. 26.12, 13. Wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this that this woman hath done be told, for a memoriall of her. oynt∣ment
upon the head of our Saviour. As they did Cornelius, whose almes-deeds were a forcible meanes to carry up his prayers into Heaven, Acts 10.31. Thy prayer is heard, and thine almes-deeds are had in remembrance. As they did Dorcas, whom the clothes which shee made for the widowes and poore orphants kept warme in her death bed (TheActs 9.39. widowes stood by her weeping, and shewing the coates and garments which Dorcas made whilest shee was with them) and were motives to Saint Peter by miracle to restore her to life. As they did Constantine the great, who made his crown the basis of Christs crosse. As they did Ludovicus, who by continuall lar∣gesse turned all his state into obligations. The meaning then is not, that none are blessed but poore: for1 Tim. 4.8. Godlinesse is pro∣fitable unto all things, &c. Godlinesse hath the promises of this life, and the life to come. But to make up the harmony of the Evangelicall do∣ctrine in this place, wee must take one note from the words as they are re∣lated by Saint Luke, and another from the words, as they are recorded by Saint Matthew in my Text. The note from Saint Luke is, That the worlds miserable man is for the most part Christs blessed man. Christs words in Saint Luke are these;Luke 6.20, 21, 24, 25. Blessed be yee poore: for yours is the Kingdome of God. Blessed are yee that hunger now: for yee shall be filled. Blessed are yee that weep now: for yee shall laugh. But woe unto you that are rich: for you have received your consolation. Woe be unto you that are full: for you shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now: for you shall mourne and weep. Vicibus res disposita est, Happinesse goes by turnes. Dives shall be Lazarus hereafter, and Lazarus on earth shall be Dives in Heaven: those who laugh here, shall weep there; and those who weep here, shall laugh there: those who feast continually, and riot in pleasures in this world, shall fast in the other; and those who fast upon earth, shall feast with the Lambe in Heaven. But the note which we are to take from Saint Matthew is, That affliction and penury, unlesse it be sanctified to us by God, no way maketh us happy: Blessed are the poore, not simply, but with an addition, in spirit. The poore are blessed, if poore in spirit, that is, humble. Blessed are they that mourn, if their mourning be a godly mourning, either out of sense of their owne sinne, or compassion of their brethrens miseries. For godly2 Cor. 7.10. sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to bee repented of; but the sorrow of the world worketh death. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst, if it be for righteous∣nesse; for there are that hunger for the flesh-pots of Egypt, and there are that thirst after bloud, or afterProv. 9.17. Stolne waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant, but hee knoweth not that the dead are there, and that her guests are in the depth of hell. stolne waters, which are sweet in the mouth, but poyson in the belly, and rottennesse in the bones. And neither of these are blessed. All that are in want are not Christs poore, neither are all that weare blackes his mourners. Saint Luke saith in effect, not many rich are blessed: Saint Matthew addeth, nor all poore, but the poore in spi∣rit onely, that is, such as are of an humble spirit, or aProv. 16.19. Esay 57 15. I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit. contrite spirit. ThoseBeza in Mat. 5. Qui sive paupertate, sive aliis calamitatibus domiti, sive ultro peccatorum suo∣rum sensu tacti, & ab omni superbiâ remoti, sese Deo subjiciunt. who by any affliction outward or inward are so thoroughly tamed and subdued, that they humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, wholly relying upon his providence for their estate, and upon his mercy for their salvation. None is poore in spirit, saithCalvin harm. Nemo spiritu pauper est, nisi qui in nihilum apud se redactus in Dei misericordiâ recumbit, namque desperatione fracti, cum adversus Deum fremunt, elato superboque spiritu esse oportet. Calvin, but he who being
brought to nothing in himselfe, casteth himselfe wholly upon Gods mer∣cy. For hee who groweth into desperate fits, and murmureth against the most High, must needs be of an impatient and proud spirit. Crosses work not alike upon all: some are bettered by them, some are made worse; some are bowed downe by them, others rise up against them. As under the same flaile the stubble is bruised, and the corne purged; and in the sameAug. l. 1. de Civ. Dei. Sub codem igneau∣rum rutilat, pa∣lea fumat. fire gold shineth, and chaffe smoaketh: so the same affliction which tryeth the faith of the godly like gold, and maketh it more precious, consumeth the temporary beliefe of hypocrites like drosse. We reade in the Apocalyps, that after the fifth Angel powred out his viall upon the seat of the Beast, that his kingdome was full of darknesse: and theyRev. 16.10. gnawed their tongues for paine, and blasphemed the God of Heaven, because of their paines, and sores, and re∣pented not of their deeds: these turned medicines into poysons, whereas on the contrary the true servants of God make medicines even of poysons; like silver Bells, they ring sweetest when they are struck hardest. Of those who are smitten by the hand of God, some like solid bones are hardened by his stroake, some like tender flesh are softened thereby, some turne to him that strikes them, others flye away from him: the former are blessed, not the latter; theirs is the Kingdome of Heaven, not theses. Here some may cast in a scruple, Why should Christ preach poverty in spirit to his Disciples, who had nothing to be proud of, being poore, illiterate, despicable men? Saint Chrysostome answereth: First, that the greater part of the multitude, to whom Christ directed his speech, were not Disciples, but men of another condition, who bare themselves upon their wealth, or place of authority; and in that regard much needed a Lecture of Humility to be read unto them. Secondly, he addeth, that this admonition was very seasonable, even to his Disciples, lest they should bee puffed up with their miraculous gifts of casting out Divels, and healing all manner of diseases. Thirdly, it may be thought also, that our Saviour used this Preface to his Sermon, not so much to instruct his Disciples, as to vindicate them and his doctrine from scorne and dis-esteeme. For if you draw out at length this rich piece of Arras, you shall finde in it the heads and lineaments of this exhortation, or the like. O yee people of Israel, and seed of Abra∣ham, you looke for a glorious and majesticall Messias to restore the kingdome unto Israel, and to make you all rich and mighty men upon earth: and therefore you despise mee and my Disciples in regard of our poverty and meane estate. But you erre, not knowing the Scriptures, not the true characters of the Messias, whose Kingdome is not of this world, neither is he here to rule this Nation in pompe and state; but to bee re∣jected of it, and to bee slaine in it, and crucified, and so to enter into his glory. And as for my Disciples and Followers, despise not them though they be poore, and in mournfull habit, and forlorne and persecuted men: for I tell you, Blessed are these poore, For theirs is the Kingdome of Hea∣ven. Blessed are these mourners: for they shall be comforted. Blessed are these persecuted men for my sake: for great is their reward in Heaven. As I come now in humility, so I preach poverty in spirit. As I come in the forme of a servant, so I preach obedience. As I come to suffer, so I
preach patience. The Disciple is not greater than his Master, nor the servant than his lord. And so I have done with the assertion or affirmation, Blessed are the poore in spirit; and am now to examine the reason or confirmation. For theirs is the Kingdome of Heaven. What Synesius spake concerning his preferment to his disadvantage, Citat. à Ca∣saub. tract. de li∣bertate ecclesiast.. Now, saith he, ascend downward: for before thou diddest descend upward (his meaning was, that now hee gained in honour, but lost in profit; but before lost in honour, and gained in wealth) may fitly be applyed to all mankinde, who fell by rising in our owne conceits, andAug. confes. l. 4. c. 12. De∣scendite ut ascendatis ad Deum, cci∣distis enim ascendendo contra eum. can no otherwise rise againe, but by falling in our selves. Wee ascended downward in Adam, when wee would bee like unto God in knowledge; but we descend upward when we strive to be like the son of man, and learne of Christ to be meeke and lowly in heart. The first precipice or downe fall to Hell both in Angel and Man was by pride: therefore humility must needs be the first step to Hea∣ven. For the rule holds both in the physicke of soule and body, Contraria curantur contrariis. As the disease is contrary to health, so the remedy is alwaies contrary to the disease. Hee that meanes to build high, must lay his foundation low: hee that setteth any choice plant, diggeth the earth deep to put in the root. All those precious and resplendent stones reckoned up in the Apocalyps, were placed in theApoc. 21.19. And the founda∣tion of the wall of the Ci y was ganshed with all manner of pre∣cious stones. foundation of the hea∣venly City, to teach us, that all Christian vertues are grounded in humility. If a vessell be full, it will receive no more liquor, be it never so soveraigne and precious. The proud and high minded man is full of his owne gifts and perfections; and therefore letteth not into his soule the wholesome dew of Gods grace. What is the reason so few great, and mighty, and noble, and wise, and learned enter into Christs schoole, or very late? because the gate is low, and they will not stoop. Holy AustinAug. confess. l. 9. c. 4. Dulce sit mihi confi∣teri quemad∣modum me complanaveris humiliatis montibus cogi¦tationum mea∣rum. Tumor meus non ca∣piebat illius modum. confesseth with teares, that his swelling greatnesse or tumour of pride would not suffer him for a long time to enter in at theMat. 7.13, 14. Enter in at the strait gate, be∣cause strait is the gate that leadeth unto life. narrow gate that leadeth unto life. In whose teares many of our noble Sparkes, or lusty Gallants, and high Spirits may reade the cause why they are so usually poore, and naked, and blinde in the inward man, and though oft-times neerest to the Court of Princes, yet are furthest off from the Kingdome of God. They will not confesse their wants, either because they suppose they have none, or they cannot endure the shame of acknowledging them: they will not begge, because they are rich in their owne conceits: they will not subject their reason to faith, be∣cause they value their reason above faith: but those that are poore in spirit are ever begging and asking at Gods hands; and therefore alwaies on the taking hand. The soule that feeleth her selfe empty, hungereth and thirsteth for righteousnesse; and therefore is satisfied. The modest man hath no opi∣nion of his owne wit or wisedome: and therefore willingly bringeth every thought into captivity, and every affection to the obedience of the Gospel. The lowly in heart esteemeth more vilely of himselfe than the world can: and therefore hee chearfully taketh up his crosse and followeth Christ. Thus have I cleared the title of the poore in spirit to the Kingdome of
Heaven: which is so sure and unquestionable, that our Saviour saith not, Theirs shall be in the future; but in the present tense, Theirs is the Kingdome of Heaven. And likewise, Suffer little children, and forbid them not to come unto mee, for of suchMatth. 19.14. is the Kingdome of Heaven. As we say of such an one that hath the advowson of a Benefice, or reversion of an Office under seale: or of an heire to a wealthy father, such a Lordship, or such a Mannour, or such an Office, or such a Benefice is his, either because hee is as sure thereof as if he were possessed of it; or because he hath actually jus ad rem, though not in re, a right to it, though not in it: so in regard of the poore in spirit their undoubted right to, and their present interest in some of the priviledges and profits of their heavenly Fathers Kingdome, that Kingdome is said here to be theirs already. When Cyneas the Embassadour of Pyrrhus, after his returne from Rome, was asked by his Master what hee thought of the City and State, he answered, that it seemed to him Respublica Regum, A State of none but great States-men, and a Common-wealth of Kings. Put the same question to Saint John concerning Jerusalem that descended from God, he will answer you in like manner, Videri rempublicam Regum, that it is no other than a Parliament of Emperours, or a Common-wealth of Kings. For in the Kingdome of grace upon earth all Kings are subjects; but in the Kingdome of glory in Heaven all subjects are Kings. Every humble and faithfull soule is coheire with Christ, and hath a robe of honour, and a scep∣ter of power, and a throne of majesty, and a crowne of glory. If you peruse the records and evidences of Heaven exemplified in holy Scripture, you shall finde no estates there but inheritances, no inheritances but kingdomes, no houses but palaces, no meales but feasts, no noyse but musicke, no rods but scepters, no garments but robes, no seates but thrones, no head orna∣ments but crownes: these inheritances, these palaces, these feasts, these songs, these scepters, these thrones, these robes, these crownes God bring us unto, and possesse us with through poverty in spirit, in the right and title purchased for us by our elder bro∣ther Christ Jesus. To whom, &c.
THE COGNISANCE OF A CHRISTIAN: OR CHRIST HIS NEW COMMANDEMENT. A Sermon preached in VVooll-Church. THE TWENTIETH SERMON. JOH. 13.34. A new commandement give I unto you, That ye love one another, as I have loved you, that yee also love one another. Right Worshipfull, &c. ALL that by a Christian vocation are severed from the world, and cut as it were out of the common rock of man∣kinde, and by faith relye upon Christ, are like so many hewen stones laid upon the chiefeEph. 2.20. corner stone rising to a spirituall building, reaching from the earth to heaven. The line by which they are built is the Word of God, & the cement wherwith they are held fast together is Chri∣stian charity, the soder of mindes, the couple of dispositions, the glew of af∣fections, and the bond of all perfection; which to fasten the more strongly, among all that gave their name to Christ, the Primitive Church in the daies of the Apostles added a double tye: 1. Sacred. 2. Civill.
The sacred was the frequent receiving of the Lords Supper: the civill was the celebrating their Agapae's, or keeping their love-feasts. Which though they were in after ages taken away, by reason of manifold abuses and disorders committed in them, even in the place of holy assemblies: yet it were to be wished, that all our feasts were truly love-feasts. I meane that the rich among us would imitate holy Job, and not eat their morsels alone, but invite those of the poorer sort to their Tables, whom Christ bids to his board: or at least that they would defaulke a great part of that charge, which is spent in furnishing these luxurious feasts, wherein this City ex∣ceedeth all in the Christian world, and convert it to the refreshing of the bowels of poore prisoners, or clothing the naked, or redeeming captives, or to some other pious and charitable use: so should your City and Com∣pany feasts be true Agapae,. love-feasts; and you testifie to all the world, what account you make of Christ his new commandement in my Text, Love one another. Of all speeches we ought to give most heed to those of our Saviour; of all speeches of our Saviour, to his commands; of all commands, to this of Christian charity: 1. Because it is a rare and choice one: A new. 2. Because it is a sweet and easie one: To love. 3. Because it is a just and reasonable one: One another. 4. Because wee have such a singular President for it: As I have loved you, &c. Wee have all Athenian eares, thirsting after newes: behold a new. Wee all professe obedience to Lawes: behold a commandement. Wee all acknowledge Christ to bee our supreme Lord, who hath absolute power of life and death; hearken then to his Proclamation, I give un∣to you. If hee had laid a heavie burthen and hard yoke upon us, wee must have submitted our neckes and shoulders to it, and wee have all reason so to doe. For hee tookeEsay 53.4. Surely be hath born our griefs, and carried our sorrowes. upon him our infirmities, and bare our sorrowes: how much more when hee layeth so sweet a yoke upon us as to love? so light a burthen as to love one another? Nothing more agree∣able to our nature than to love, nothing more needfull to our condition than to love one another. Wee all stand in need one of another, this need is sup∣ported by love, this love is commanded by Christ, this command of Christ is new. AsM. Tul. Cicer. Orator. Nume∣rum verborum, numero senten∣tiarum com∣plexus est. Tully spake of Thucydides his stile, that in his Orations every word was a sentence. And as Saint Jerome observeth in the Apocalyps, Quot verba, tot sacramenta, that there are so many mysteries in it as words: so wee may say of this Text, Quot verba, tot argumenta; so many words, so many arguments: so many notions, so many motions or motives to this du∣ty of mutuall love. To which we ought to have a speciall eye, and extraor∣dinary regard: First, because it is a new commandement. Secondly, because it is Christs commandement, I give unto you. Thirdly, because it is an amiable and easie one: To love. Fourthly, because it is a generall and indifferent one: Every one. Fifthly, because it is so just and profitable a one: One another.
Lastly, because it is prest by such a rare example as the world never had the like, As I have loved you. You see the eares that stand above the rest, which by the example of the Apostles on the Sabbath, I willMat. 12.1. rubbe in the handling of them to stay your spirituall hunger a while. A new. The first word in my Text is new; and even this may seem new and strange, that Christ calleth here this commandement of love a new commandement, which is as old as the Law of Moses, nay as the law of na∣ture. For before Christ made love Gospel, Moses made it written Law; and before Moses made it written Law, God made it a branch, or rather the root of the law of nature: before the Evangelist wrote this precept in the Gospel, Moses wrote it in the Law, and before Moses wrote it in the Law, God wrote it with his owne finger in tables of stone, and long before that in the fleshly tables of Adams heart. How then doth our Saviour here terme it a new commandement, which is so old, that SaintJohn 3.11. This is the mes∣sage that ye recei∣ved from the be∣ginning, that yee love one another. John himselfe commendeth it from the antiquity? As Saint Ambrose spake of the Che∣rubins in Ezekiels vision, Si stabant, quomodo movebant? si movebant, quo∣modo stabant? If they stood still, how did they move? if they moved, how did they stand still? may not we likewise argue the case thus, If the duty of mu∣tuall love be a message received from the beginning, either of the promulga∣tion of the Law, or the Creation it selfe; how is it here stiled new? If it be so new in Saint Johns Gospel, how is it so old in his Epistle? Every an∣swer shaped by the Interpreters to this question may serve for a severall exposition of this Text, and a speciall motive to this duty of mutuall love. First,Mald. in Mat. Multa dum vo∣biscum versatus sum dedi man∣data, multa do∣cumenta, nunc dabo unum quod instat est omnium. Maldonat resolveth it to bee an Hebraisme, in which language new, rare, and most excellent are synonimaes. A new name (Apoc. 2.) is a most honourable name. A new song (Psal. 69.) a most excellent song. New wine (Matth. 26.29.) vinum praestantissimum alterius generis, the best wine; so here a new commandement is a rare, a choice, a speciall, a re∣markable one: as if our Lord had said, Unum praeque omnibus unum, One above all other. CalvinCalvin in hunc loc. Vult hujus mandati per∣petuò vos esse memores, ac si lex esset recens nata. Scimus leges initio di∣ligentiûs ser∣vari, sensim ve∣rò labi ex ho∣minum memo∣riâ, donec tan∣dem obsole∣scant: ergo Christus quo magis infigat charitatem suo∣rum animis à novitate eam commendat. varieth not much from Maldonat, paraphrasing thus, Christ would have us perpetually mindfull of this his precept, as if it were a law newly enacted. For wee know, saith hee, that lawes at the first making of them are carefully looked unto, and diligently observed; but by degrees weare out of mens memory, and in the end grow quite into dis-use: therefore Christ, the more to fasten love in the minds of his, commendeth it unto them as a new commandement. The most of the Ancients conceive this commandement to be termed new, because it is propounded here novâ formâ, in a new form. In the Law it runs thus, Love thy neighbour as thy selfe: but in the Gospel, Love one another as I have loved you, that is, in some case more than your selves. For indeed so did Christ, laying downe his life for us. Yet SaintAug. in hunc loc. Novum di∣citur ab ef∣fectu quod nos renovet, & ex∣uto vetere no∣vo induat. Austin hath a new way by himselfe; hee saith, that the commandement of love is here said to be NEW from the effect, because it renewes us, and by it we put off the old man, and put on the new. Let us strike all these strings together, and make a chord of them: What account ought we to make of, how care∣fully to observe the commandement of our Saviour, which is a rare and sin∣gular one, and so new: renewed and revived by Christ in the Gospel, and so new: delivered in a new manner, and after a new forme, and so new: en∣forced
by a new president, and so new: lastly, which maketh us new in our mindes, in our inward and outward man, and so new? The most fluent and currant sense of the words seemeth to be this. Christ had before called his Disciples children, and fore-told them that hee was shortly to leave them: therefore hee giveth them here such counsels and precepts as fathers usual∣ly give their children when they are to take a long journey. Children, I am now to leave you, who have been your greatest stay and comfort: now therefore you must bee a mutuall help and comfort one to another. My peace I leave with you, my love I commend unto you. I give you now my last and newest commandement, to love one another as I have loved you. I have loved you 1. Freely: for you chose notJohn 15.16. mee, but I chose you. 2. Sincerely: for I have left my Father and a Kingdome in Heaven to live with you. 3. Exceedingly: for I have resolved to layJohn 15.13. downe my life for you. 4. Constantly: for having loved mine owne which were in the world, I loved them toJohn 13.1. the end. Let your love bee such one to another, that all that see you may know you by this badge to be my Disciples. This cognisance was so bright to bee seen in the livery of the Christians of the Primitive Church, that by their love-feasts and charitable contribu∣tions, and having all things in common, and visiting their sicke in time of in∣fection, and having recourse one to another in prisons, and dungeons, and dens, and caves of the earth, and accompanying one another to the racke, to the gibbet, to the blocke, to the fire, to all sorts of most exquisite tortures and torments, the Heathen knew a man to be a Christian. But this badge grew in after ages dimmer, and now it is in a maner quite worn out. Which that it might not come to passe, our Saviour inGorth. in hunc loc. Ideo novum dicit manda∣tum, quia sem∣per debet re∣cens esse in cor∣de, quia sem∣per debet di∣lectio innovari, ac nunquam per interrupti∣onem aut neg∣ligentiam inve∣terari. Gorrhams judgement pro∣poseth this precept of love in this forme of words, A new commandement I give unto you, that is, such a one as ought to be alwaies fresh in your mind and memory, and never to waxe old, or be blotted out of your heart by any dis-use or negligence. To come yet neerer to the native and genuine sense of the words, a law may be said to be new out of a double consideration:  Either in respect of the thing commanded, if it be such a thing as before ne∣ver fell under any law and this is the meaning of our Proverbe, Novus rex, nova lex, New lords, new lawes; because for the most part new governours and rulers bring in new customes, proclaime new edicts, and settle new or∣ders in Church and Common-wealth:  Or in respect of the new act of com∣manding; so an old Statute, when it is revived may be called a new Statute, as an old booke when it is re-printed, or an old fashion laid aside for a long time when it is againe taken up, passeth for new. In both these respects this commandement in my Text may be said to be new. 1. First, in respect of the duty commanded. For though mutuall love were long before this enjoyned, yet not this love, whereby Chri∣stians are required to love one another as Disciples of one Master, nay
as members of one mysticall body, whereof Christ Jesus is the head. 2. Secondly, in respect of the new act of commanding, expressed in these words, I give unto you. The promises of Christ in the Law, are the Gospel of the Law; as on the other side, the precepts of Christ in the Gospel, are the Law of the Gospel: there isJames 4.12. one Law-giver, who is able to save and destroy; and this Law-giver is Christ, the Judge of quicke and dead. It belongs to Kings to give Lawes to their subjects, Masters to their servants, Parents to their children: Christ was theirMatth. 2.1. King, and their Master, and their Fa∣ther; for he calleth them children, saying, LittleJoh. 13.13, 33. children, yet a while I am with you. In which of these relations are we to God; as our King, or our Master, or our Father? are we subjects, servants, or children? If wee are subjects, let us obey our King. If wee are his servants, let us doe our Ma∣sters will. If wee are children, let us keep the commandements of our Fa∣ther. Had the2 Kings 5.13. Prophet, saith Naamans servant, bid thee to doe some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? How much more when hee saith unto thee, Wash and be cleane? so may I say unto you, If our Master, our Father, our King had laid a hard taske upon us, wee ought to have done it; how much more when hee saith but Love as I have loved you, A new comman∣dement I give unto you? To love. ToArist. 2. rhet. ca. 4. . love is to beare good affection to another, and to bee wil∣ling and ready to doe him all the good we can for his owne sake, without any eye to our selves therein. Otherwise, if wee love him for our pleasure, we love indeed our pleasure, and not him: if we love him for our profit, we love our profit, and not him: if we love him for any end of our owne, we love our selves, not him. The Flie loveth not the Apothecaries shop, but the sweet oyntment there. Craterus loved not Alexander, but the Crown: and therefore was termed  not . The Jewes loved not Christ, but theJohn 6.26. loaves which hee multiplyed by miracle: Verily, verily, I say unto you, yee seeke mee not because you saw the miracles; but because you did eate of the loaves, and were filled. The Schooles therefore well distin∣guish of a double love, 1. Amor concupiscentiae. 2. Amor amicitiae. A love of concupiscence, and a love of friendship. If the love of concupi∣scence exceed, it degenerateth into either lust, covetousnesse, or ambition. If it carry us inordinately to pleasure, it is lust or sensuality. If to gaine, it is covetousnesse. If to honour, it is ambition. The love of friendship is of another nature, it loveth a person for himselfe, not for any by respect; or to speake more properly, it loveth Christ in our Christian brother, and may bee well termed the naturall heat of Christs mysticall body, which conveigheth nourishment into all parts, and performeth all vitall functions. It is a spirituall grace, knitting the hearts of the faithfull in affection one to another, melting them in compassion one of another, and dilating and en∣larging them in delight and joy one in another. In the delineation of this plant of Paradise I will imitate the Naturalists, and describe it by the root, the maine stocke, the branches, the blossomes, the
leaves, the fruit. The root is the knowledge of God. For as the beames of the Sunne reflected from thicke glasses generate heat; so the light of di∣vine knowledge incident upon the understanding, and reflected upon the will, produceth in it the ardent affection of the love of God, and from it, as the maine arme of the tree, issue two branches, the love of our neighbour, and of our selves. The blossomes on these branches are good meanings, de∣sires, and purposes, to wish all good to our neighbour, to think well of him, to congratulate his felicity, and to condole his misery. The leaves are good speeches, counsels, and prayers. The fruit are good workes and almes∣deeds, to correct him in his errours, to comfort him in his troubles, to vi∣sit him in his sicknesse, and to relieve him in his necessities. And, to speake truth, to love in truth is to love in deed, and charitable deeds are the deeds and evidences that certainly prove a good conveighance of this affection. Let us love, saith the Apostle, not in1 John 3.18. My little chil∣dren, let us not love in word not in tongue, but in deed & in verity. word and in tongue, but indeed and ve∣rity. Deed and verity as you heare are all one: and therefore word onely, and vanity and hypocrisie, must goe together, as also the Latine phrase verba dare signifieth. TrueJames 1. ult. religion and undefiled before God even the Fa∣ther is this, to visit the fatherlesse and the widow in their affliction, and to keep himselfe unspotted of the world. I would all who professe religion were of this religion of Saint James. For the religion which is (I will not say pro∣fessed) but practised by most men, is aptly set forth unto us in the Wezel, quae aureAdrian. Jun. mhl. concipit, parturit ore, which conceiveth at the eare, & bringeth forth at the mouth. It conceiveth in the eare in the frequent, if not perpe∣tuall hearing of Sermons; but bringeth forth onely at the mouth by dis∣courses of religion, pious counsels, good words, and liberall prayers, such as these, God helpe thee, God relieve thee, God comfort thee, Alas poore soule (alas poore comfort.) Words bee they never so adorned, clothe not the naked: be they never so delicate, feed not the hungry: be they never so zealous, warme not him that is starved with cold: be they never so soft, cure not the wounded: be they never so free, set not free them that are bound, visit not the sicke or imprisoned: in a word, performe not any of those du∣ties which shall be vouchsafed the naming at the generall day of retribution unto all men, which shall be according to their workes, not according to their words. The witty Epigrammatist deservedly casteth a blurre upon Candidus his faire name and debonaire carriage, because all the fruits of his friendship grew upon his tongue: Martial Epigr.Candide κοῖνα φιλῶν haec sunt tua Candide πάντα, quae tu magniloquus nocte dieque sonas. Ex opibus tantis veteri fidoque sodali das nihil, & dicis Candide κοινα φιλων. Thou sayst, my friend Candidus, that all things are common among friends, but it seems these words of thine are thy all things. For of all thy wealth and goods thou makest no friend thou hast a doite the better, thou givest nothing at all, and yet art most prodigall in thy language, and wearest out that Proverb threed-bare, , All things are common amongst friends. The Naturalists observe, that the females of Bids oftentimes lay
egges without cockes, but they are , ova subventanea, egges fil∣led up with winde, unfit to be hatched: such is the issue of most mens love now a dayes, it bringeth forth partus subventaneos, windy brats, that is, good words, faire promises, and happy wishes. But though in our gardens of pleasure wee nourish many plants and trees for their beautifull blossomes and goodly flowers, yet it is manifest out of the 16.Thou shalt eare freely of every tree in the garden. Verse of the second of Genesis, that there grew no tree in the terrestriall Paradise of God that bare not fruit, neither shall any but such as fructifie bee transplanted into the celestiall. For,Mat. 3.10. Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen downe and cast into the fire. Wee reade in our Chronicles of King Oswald, that as he sate at table, when a faire silver dish full of regall delicacies was set before him, and he ready to fall to, hearing from his Amner that there were great store of poore at his gate piteously crying for some reliefe, commanded his Steward presently to take the dish off the table, and distri∣bute the meat, and beat the dish all in pieces, & cast it among them: where∣at the Bishop his Amner, taking hold of his hand, was heard to use these or the like speeches, Nunquam veterascet haec manus, the hand which beareth such fruit shall never wither or waxe old; & in part he was a true Prophet: for afterwards in a battell where the King was slaine, having his arme first cut off, the arme with the hand being found, were covered in silver, & kept as a holy Relique; and by this means endured many hundred of yeers after the whole body was consumed. That which quencheth Hell fire in the conscience is the bloud of Christ, that which applyeth this bloud is faith, that which quickneth this faith is love, that which demonstrateth this love are workes of mercy and bounty, piety and pity, which are not so much offices to men, as sacrifices to God: faith cryeth for these, as Rachel did for children, Give mee fruit, or else I dye. For,James 2.26. Faith without works is dead, as the body without breath. And can aman (think we) live by a dead faith? Give, saith our Saviour, and it shall be given unto you. Which precept of his was so imprinted in the minde of that noble MatronHieron. epi∣taph. Paul. Mat. Damnum pu∣tabat, si quis∣quam debilis aut esuriens ci∣bo sustentare∣tur alterius. Et Cyp. de elec∣mos. Demus Christo vesti∣menta terrena indumenta coe∣lestia recepturi, demus cibum & potum secu∣larem cum A∣brah. Isa. & Jac. ad coeleste convivium venturi. Paula, that shee ac∣counted it a great losse and dammage to her, if any prevented her charity in relieving any poore or distressed member of Christ; she was a like affected, as if one had taken a great bargaine out of her hand: A great bargaine in∣deed, to lay out mony in earthly trash, and receive for it heavenly treasure; to bestow ragges, and receive robes; to give a little broken meat that peri∣sheth to the hungry, and for it to bee bid with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to an everlasting banquet in Heaven. I should close with this sweet straine of Saint Cyprian, but that there remaineth another note pricked in the last words of my Text. , One another. If any demand why Christ addeth this clause, en∣joyning mutuall love: I answer, because gratitude, charity, and necessity inforceth it. Where love is not answered, there is no gratitude: where kindnesse is not requited, there is no justice: where offices of friendship are not mutually performed, there is no life. AllSenec. ep. 48. Alteri vivas oportet, si vis tibi. Societas nostra lapidum fornici simili∣ma est, quae ca∣sura nisi invi∣cem obstarent, hoc ipso susti∣nentur. humane societies are like archt-building, in which, unlesse every stone hold up another, the whole frame suddenly falleth. Howbeit, though gratitude, justice and necessity plead for correspondency in Christian charity; yet the world is full of com∣plaints of parents against their children, husbands against their wives, pa∣stors
against their flockes, tutours against their pupills, masters against their servants. that their providence, love, and care is not answered in the ob∣servance, love, gratitude, and obedience of their inferiours. Fathers up∣braid their children, saying, Amor descendit, non ascendit; Love descendeth from us to our children, but ascendeth not from them to us. Husbands com∣mence actions of unkindnesse against the wives of their bosome, that the kinder they are to them the more disloyall they find them. Pastors take up the Apostles complaint against his Corinthians, that the2. Cor. 12.15. more he loved them, the lesse hee was loved againe. Tutours murmure, that their care to breake their scholars of ill conditions is recompenced with hatred. And Masters, that their good usage of their servants is requited with con∣tempt: whereby you see how needfull it was that Christ should with his owne mouth as it were heat the glew to joyne our affections toge∣ther, with his own finger knit the knot to tye our hearts together, with his owne hands to write a new bond to inwrap our soules one in another, and with his owne presse print anew in our mind the commandement of mutu∣all love: the characters whereof were quite worne out of most mens me∣mory. Seneca fitly resembleth the mutuall and reciprocall duties of friend∣ship, in giving and receiving benefits one from another, to a game at Ten∣nis, wherein the ball is tossed backward and forward from one racket to another, and never falleth to the ground; or if it fall, it is his forfeit who mist his stroake: even so every kind office, wherewith our friend serveth us, ought to be returned backe to him, that no courtesie fall to the ground. The Cherubins faces in theExod. 37.9. Arke were one to another: Alter in alterius jacientes lumina vultum. And the wheeles in EzekielsEzek. 1.16. vision were one in the midst of the other; to teach us, that we ought not only to cast a benigne aspect one upon another like Cherubins, but also to be inwardly knit one in another like the wheels: that we may be one in another as Christ is inJohn 17.23. the Father, and wee in him; I in them, and they in mee, that they may be made perfect in one. Whereso∣ever almost in holy Scripture this obligation of love is mentioned, the con∣dition is expressed that it be mutuall: as in affection, Be likeRom. 12.10. one to another: in courtesie, to saluteRom. 16.16. one another: in humility, to washJohn 13.14. one anothers feet: in love, to serveGal. 5.13. one another: in hospitality, to1 Pet. 4.9. entertaine one another: in patience, toColos. 3.13. forbeare one another: in compassion, to beareGal. 6.2. one anothers burdens: in devotion, to prayJam. 5.16. one for another: in holy communication, to1. Thes. 5.11. edifie one another. Here morall Philosophy goeth hand in hand with Divinity, demonstrating that true friendship cannot but be mutuall, because the foundation of it is a similitude of manners and dispositions: which simi∣litude being a relation, cannot but be in both. And daily experience teach∣eth us, that as fire in an apt subject generateth fire; so love begetteth love. I will tell thee, saithSeneca ep. 9. Ego tibi mon∣strabo amato∣rium sine medi∣camento, sine herba: Si amari vis, ama. Seneca, how thou maist make another love thee, without any love potion, spell or witchcraft: if thou desirest to bee beloved, love thou first sincerely and entirely. This recipe is approved byArist rhet. l. . . Aristotle, who saith, that of all men they are the most lovely, that are most loving. And by the Poet, who adviseth him who desireth to endeare the affections of another to himselfe,
first to endeare his affections to her, and to kindle fully that fire in his owne breast, which hee would have burne in hers. Sit procul omne nefas, ut ameris, amabilis esto. Plato writeth under this his probatum est, and he instanceth in Socrates and Alcibiades; the one whereof had no sooner began a health of love, but the other pledged him in the same cup, atque ita mutuum imbiberunt amorem. He must needs be of a very ill disposition, qui amorem si nolit impendere, nolit rependere, who if he will not begin love, and provoke this affection in another, will not yet repay love, and answer love with love, and courtesie with courtesie, considering that as the affection is mutuall, so the gaine is reciprocall. As in a Hop-yard the poles sustaine the Hops, and the Hops by imbracing adorne the poles: and as in a building the walls beare up the roofe, and the roofe keepeth the walls and timber from wet; so it is among friends: the wise directeth the strong, and the strong defendeth the wise; the wealthy maintaines the honourable, and the honourable supporteth the wealthy. There is not onely a re-action between naturall, but also between mo∣rall agents. Philosophy demonstrateth omne agens repati, & omne patiens reagere, that every agent suffereth from his patient, and every patient worketh againe upon the agent, either in the same or in a divers and con∣trary kinde. In the same kind, as when the hammer and the anvile one har∣den the other: or when two Mill-stones grate one on the other, or two tooles whet and sharpen one the other: In a divers and contrary kinde, as when the warme hand heateth the cold, the cold hand cooleth the warme: the stone drieth the drop of raine, and the drop moisteneth the stone; And in physicke, the corasives sharpen the lenitives, and the lenitives mitigate the corasives. In like manner every one that doth good should receive, and every one that receiveth from another should do good to the other, either in the same kinde, as when two Preachers like lights kindle one the others knowledge, or two Physicians heale one the other, or two Bone-setters set one the others joynts, or two Lawyers plead one for the other, or two Souldiers fight one for the other: Or in a divers and contrary kinde, as when the confident Christian comforteth the weake, and the weake Chri∣stian by relating his conflicts and temptations, is a meanes to keep the strong and confident Christian from presumption; the zealous professour inflameth the moderate, and the moderate temperateth the zealous; the rich supplyeth the want of the poore, and the poore taketh away from the superfluity of the rich. Thus in the same kinde, or in a divers and contrary, every one that is willing may hold correspondency and faire quarter in love. If no otherwise wee can requite the kindnesse of our friends, yet in thankfull acceptance we may; and the acknowledgement of the debt of love is a good part of the payment. The jewell which is illustrated by the Sun beames, coloureth the beames; and the earth which receiveth moisture from the skie, repayeth it backe againe in vapours and exhalations: yea the rockes and stones which receive a sound from the ayre before it bee fully given, returne it by an eccho; onely selfe-love and ingratitude returne no∣thing backe againe. Selfe-love is a bad creditour, it will lay out nothing;
and ingratitude is a bad debtour, it will repay nothing. The former resem∣bleth the Pumish stone, from which no moisture at all can bee extracted; the later is like the stone of Syphnos, which being steeped in oyle becom∣meth the harder by it: such is an ungratefull person, the better you are to him, the worse he demeaneth himselfe towards you. Dearly beloved Christians, if any man could live of himselfe, hee might have some colour to live to himselfe onely: but sith all civill life and hu∣mane society is maintained by giving and receiving, as the naturall is by ta∣king in and letting out breath; let us abandon those vices above all others, that stop the entercourse of courteous offices passing from one friend to an∣other, and let us all imbrace that Christian vertue, which joyneth all men unto us, and us unto all men in the glew of affections and bond of perfecti∣on. Let us give, that we may receive: let us sow liberally, that wee may reap plentifully: let us scatter abroad earthly, that we may gather heaven∣ly treasure. While we have time let us do good unto all, especially to the houshold of faith; and in this time of fulnesse thinke of the empty belly, and out of our super∣fluity supply their extreme want. We reade in the Jewish Talmud, that the grapes in Babel upon a time sent to the vines in Judea for some of their broad leaves to overshade them; otherwise the scorching heat would consume them in such sort, that they could never come to matu∣rity. This Apologue shall serve for my Apologie, if I presse you at this time with all the interest I have in your love, nay with all the power that I have as a Minister of Christ Jesus, to contribute something to the neces∣sity of your brethren. You know well the grapes I told you of, which send to you, as the grapes in Babel did to the vines in Judea, to impart unto them some of your sap, and to shade them under your well spread boughes, or else they will undoubtedly wither and perish. I beseech you in the bowells of Christ Jesus come not behind, but rather goe before others in pious bounty and Christian charity. So the good will of him that dwelt in the bush make you all like the tree in the first Psalme, planted by the rivers of waters, that bringeth forth his fruit in due season, and his leafe shall not wi∣ther, and whatsoever he doth it shall prosper.
THE STEWARDS ACCOUNT. A Sermon preached in the Abbey Church at WESTMINSTER. THE XXI. SERMON. LUKE 16.2. Give an account of thy stewardship: for thou maist be no longer Steward. Right Reverend, right Honourable, right Worshipfull, &c. THat I may give a better account of the mysteries of sa∣ving truth, and you of the blessings of this life, whereof God hath made us Stewards in different kindes, I have chosen for the subject of my serious meditations, and the object of your religious consideration, this parcell of sa∣cred Scripture, which admonisheth us all to looke to our severall accounts, to examine and cleare them, that wee may have them ready and perfect when our Lord and Master shall call for them from every of us by name, and in particular, saying, Give an account of thy stewardship. The words are part of a Parable, which resembleth the tents of Solo∣mon, vile and blacke without, but full of precious things within. For on the out-side we reade nothing but a narration of an unjust Steward, or crafty Merchant, who being called to an account, and justly fearing to bee turned out of his place upon it, in time provideth against the worst, and taketh a course to make himselfe whole by cheating his Master: but in the in-side there are many beautifull Images of divine doctrines, drawne by the pensill
of the holy Ghost, which I purpose to set before you, after I have opened the vaile of the letter, by shewing you 1. What are the goods for which the Steward is to reckon. 2. Who is the Steward charged with these goods. 3. What manner of account he is to give. Touching the first, the learned Interpreters of this mysterious Parable are at strife, and (if I may so speake) in law about the goods left in the hands of this unfaithfull Steward. Some put temporall blessings only and world∣ly wealth in his account. Others by goods understand the Word and Sa∣craments principally, wherewith the Ministers of the Gospel are trusted. But Bonaventure lighting one candle by another, expoundeth this Parable by the other Parable of the five talents, and taketh the goods here com∣mitted to the Steward, to bee those five talents delivered to every man to trade and negotiate withall for God his Master: and thus hee telleth them, 1. Naturae, 2. fortunae, 3. potentiae, 4. scientiae, 5. gratiae: the first of nature, the second of wealth, the third of power, the fourth of knowledge, the fifth of grace. By nature hee understandeth all the naturall faculties of the minde, and organs and instruments of the body. By wealth, riches and possessions. By power, offices and authority. By knowledge, all arts and sciences. By grace, all the gifts of the spirit, and supernaturall infused habits, such as are faith, hope, and charity, &c. whereunto if hee had added a most precious Jewell, which if it be once lost can never be recovered, viz. our time, hee had given a true and perfect Inventary of all the goods, for which the un∣faithfull Steward in my Text is called to an account. Touching the second, about whom there is as great contestation and va∣riety of opinions, as about the goods themselves. Gaudentius maketh a Steward of the Divell, who justly deserveth the name of an unjust servant, for wasting his lords substance, that is, spoyling his creatures, and robbing him of his chiefest treasure, the soules of men. But if the Divell bee the Steward, who is the accuser of this Steward? doubtlesse he can be no other than the Divell, whose stile is theRevel. 12.10. The accuser of the brethren is cast down, which accuseth them be∣fore the Lord day and night. Accuser of the brethren. The Divell therefore is not the Steward here meant, whom God never set over his family, nor trusted him with any of his goods since he became a Divell. Tertullian conceiveth the people of the Jewes, to whom the Tables and Pots of Manna, and Oracles of God were committed, to be the Stewards called to an account in my Text for the abuse of these holy things. If wee follow this Interpretation, neither the Parable nor the Text any way con∣cerneth us Christians: therefore Saint Ambrose, Saint Chrysostome, Saint Augustine, Beda, Euthymius, and Theophylact enlarge the Stewards Patent, and put all rich men in the world in it, who are advised to make friends with the unrighteous Mammon they have in their hands, that when they faile their friends may receive them into everlasting habitations. Lastly, Saint Jerome and others put in hard for the Ministers of the Gospel, to whom they assigne the first place in the Patent, as being Stewards in the most eminent kinde, and so stiled both by ourLuke 12.42. Who then is the faithfull & wise Steward whom his lord shall make ruler over his houshold, to give them their portion of meat in due season? Saviour, and hisTit. 1.7. A Bishop must be blamelesse, as the Steward of God, & 1 Cor. 4.1. Let a man so account of us, as Stewards of the mysteries of God. Apostle.
To reconcile these opinions, and make a perfect concord of seeming dis∣cords, I understand by the great husband or rich man in the Parable Al∣mighty God, whose house is the whole world, & all things in it his wealth. Men indued with reason and understanding are his Stewards, whom he hath set over this great houshold, to governe the rest of his creatures, and em∣ploy the riches of his goodnesse to the advancement of his glory. These are all accountable unto him: the Jewes peculiarly for such things as hee bequeathed to his children by the Old Testament; the Christians for such things as he hath bequeathed to them by the New: the unregenerate are to reckon with him for the gifts of nature; the regenerate for the graces of the spirit: the rich for his wealth, the noble for his honour, the mighty for his power, the learned for his knowledge, every man for that hee re∣ceiveth of the riches of his mercy in spirituall, temporall, or corporall blessings. In which regard we may rightly terme Kings Stewards of their crownes, Lords of their lands, Captaines of their armies, Bishops of their diocesse, Pastours of their parishes, Housholders of their families, and eve∣ry private man of the closet of his conscience, and treasury of his heart. For all Kings are Gods subjects, all Captaines are his souldiers, all Teachers are his schollers, all Masters are his servants, and consequently all Lords his stewards. In a word, there is none of so high a calling in the world that is more, nor any of so low a calling or small reckoning that is lesse than a Steward of the King of kings, who shall one day call not onely all men of sort, but even all sorts of men to a most strict and exact account; Kings for their scepters, Magistrates for their swords, Officers for their staves, Bishops for their crosiers, Souldiers for their weapons, Clerkes for their pens, Landlords for their possessions, Patrons for their advowsons, Mer∣chants for their trade, Tradesmen for their crafts, Husbandmen for their ploughes, calling to every one in particular, Give an account of thy Stew∣ardship. Touching the third, some render the originall , render a reason; others give an account: some actus tui, of thy Factorship, as Tertullian; others villicationis tuae, of thy Bailiwicke, as Saint Jerome; a third sort dispensationis tuae, of thy Stewardship, as the Kings Transla∣tors. A great difference in sound of words, but little or none at all in sense: for though a Factor in forraine parts, and a Steward at home, and a Baily in the country are distinct offices, and different imployments; yet to the meaning of this Parable they are all one. For they all deale with other mens mony, rent, or goods, and are all liable to an account, and upon it dis∣chargeable. And in this place, whether wee translate , a reason, or a rec∣koning, all commeth to one reckoning: for upon the matter, to render a rea∣son of monies disbursed by us, is to give an account. A carefull Steward or Accomptant in any kinde, besides the casting of the summes, setteth downe a reason of every parcell of mony laid out by him after this maner: Item in provision so much. Item in reparations. Item for workmens hire. Item for law sutes, &c. thus much. Howbeit they that delight in tithing Mint and Cummin, and nicely distinguishing between words of very like, if not altogether the same signification, observe that in precise propriety of speech wee are said to give an account how, but render a reason why wee
have disbursed such monies: and that our account must bee of our Masters goods; but our reason of our owne actions: and wee are accountable onely for that we have laid out; but we are answerable, or to yeeld a reason to our Master as well for that wee have not laid out for his profit in due sea∣son, as for that we have laid out for his necessities. For hee expecteth gaine of every talent committed to us, and will not onely accept his owne without advantage. The things wee are to account for are contained under these three heads: 1. Goods. 2. Gifts. 3. Graces. By goods, I understand the blessings of this life, which the Philosopher calleth bona fortunae. By gifts, indowments of nature, which they call bona naturae. By graces, divine vertues, which the Schooles call habitus infusos. In our booke of account Under the first head, viz. goods of this world, wee must write, How be∣stowed. Under the second, viz, gifts of nature, we must write, How imployed. Under the third, viz. graces of the spirit, we must write, How impro∣ved. And if it appeare upon our accounts, that we have well bestowed the first in holy, pious, and charitable uses; and well imployed the second in care∣fully discharging the generall duties of a good Christian, and diligently performing the particular workes of our speciall calling; and have much increased the third, by our spirituall trade with God, by hearing, medita∣ting, reading, conferring, praying, and the constant practise of piety, and exercise of every divine vertue and grace: then our Master will say unto us, WellMat. 25.21. done good and faithfull servant, thou hast been faithfull in a little, bee thou ruler over much, enter into thy Masters joy. But if we have kept unprofitably, or wasted riotously the first, the wealth of the world; and retchlesly abused the second, the dowry of nature, or by idlenesse let it rust; and rather diminished than increased the third, the treasury of spiritu∣all graces; then we are to render a reason, & make answer for these defaults: and if our answer be not the better, to make satisfaction to our Lord to the uttermost farthing, after we are put out of our Stewardship, as the reason annexed to the command implyeth, For thou maist be no longer Steward. Give then an account of thy Stewardship, that is, of thy life; whereof thou art not lord but steward, to spend it in thy Masters service, and lay it downe for his honour. Cast up all the particulars of thy life, summe up thy thoughts, words, and deeds: redde rationem 1. Mali commissi. 2. Boni omissi. 3. Temporis amissi. Make answer for 1. The evill thou hast committed. 2. The good thou hast omitted. 3. The time thou hast pretermitted or mis-pent, either in
1. Doing nothing at all. 2. Or nothing to the purpose. 3. Or that which is worse than nothing, tracing the endlesse mazes of worldly and sinfull vanities. Now to proceed from the exposition of the words, to the handling of the parts of this Scripture, which are evidently two: 1. A command,Division. wherein I observe 1. The person commanding, God, under the name of a rich man. 2. The persons commanded, all men, under the name of Stewards. 3. The thing commanded, to give an account. 4. The office for which this account is to bee given, a Stew∣ardship. 5. The propriety of this office, thine. 2. A reason, wherein I note 1. The Stewards discharge, and quitting his office, thou mayest, &c. 2. The time, now. Which particular points of observation direct us to these doctrinall conclusions, 1. That God is Lord of all. 2. That all men are Stewards. 1. Not Lords. 2. Not Treasurers. 3. That all Stewards shall be called to an account. 4. That the office for which they are to account is their own Steward∣ship, not anothers. 5. That upon this account they shall be discharged. These conclusions resemble the rings spoken of by St.Aug l 21. de civit. Dei. Austin, whereof the first being touched by the Load-stone drew the second, the second the third, the third the fourth, and the fourth the fifth. For here the first point inferreth the second: If God be Lord of all, men can bee but Stewards. The second inferreth the third: If all men are Stewards, all men are accountable. The third the fourth: If all men are accountable for a Stewardship, this Stewardship must needs be their owne. The fourth the fifth: If they are to account for their owne Stewardship, certainly either at the private audit, the day of their death, or at the publike audit, the day of judgement, after which
they shall be no longer Stewards, but either Lords in Heaven, or Slaves in Hell. Wherefore, O Christian, whosoever thou art, whether thou swayest the scepter, or handlest the spade: whether thou sittest at the sterne, or rowest at the oare: whether thou buildest on the roofe, or dig∣gest at the foundation, make full account of it, thou shalt be called to an ac∣count for thy worke; be not idle therefore nor secure. Secondly, that for which thou art to account is no place of authority, but an office of trust: no Lordship, but a Stewardship: be not proud of it, nor unfaithfull in it. Thirdly, this office of trust is not a Treasurership, but a Stewardship; be not covetous, nor unprofitable. Fourthly, this Stewardship is not an∣others, but thine owne; be not curious, nor censorious. Fifthly, this thy Stewardship is not perpetuall, but for a time, it expireth with thy life; be not negligent, nor fore-slacke thy opportunity of making friends to receive thee into everlasting habitations after thou must relinquish thy office. That God is Lord of all, his claime unto all is a sufficient evidence to us. For hee cannot pretend a false title, who is truth it selfe: neither can any question his right in any Court, who is author of all lawes, as hee is maker of all things: which are his by a threefold right, 1. Of Creation. 2. Purchase. 3. Possession. 1. Of Creation: for that which a man maketh is his owne. 2. Of Purchase: for that which any one purchaseth is his owne. 3. Of Possession: for that which any one is possessed of time out of minde is his owne. By the first of these the Father may claime us, as all things else, who made all. By the second the Sonne, who redeemed the world. By the third the holy Ghost, who inhabiteth us, and after a speciall manner possesseth us.Isa. 66.1. Heaven is my throne, saith God, and the earth is my footstoole. You see then great reason why God should be compared to a rich man, with whom all the rich men in the world may not compare, neither in lands, nor in cattell, nor in mony and treasure. Not in lands: for the bounds of the earth are his land-markes, and the Sunne is his Surveyer. Nor in cattell: forPsal. 50. every beast of the forrest is his, and the cattell upon a thousand hills. Not in mony or plate: forHaggai 2. gold is mine, and silver is mine, saith the Lord. Nor lastly in goods: for that golden chaine of the Apo∣stle,1 Cor. 22.23. All are yours, and ye are Christs, and Christ is Gods, may bee drawne backward by the same linkes thus: All are Gods, and God is Christs, and Christ is ours. Yea, but it may be argued against this conclusion, that God hath small or no demaines, in as much as hee holdeth nothing in his owne hands, ha∣ving let out (if I may so speake) the heaven to Saints and Angels, the ayre to Birds and Fowle, the water to Fish, the earth to Men and Beasts to dwell in it, and reap the fruits thereof. But the answer is easie: for though God make no benefit of any thing to himselfe, yet hee keepeth the right and propriety of all things in himselfe; and hee must needs keep all things in
his hands, who clincheth the Heavens with his fist. Moreover, hee requi∣reth homage of all his creatures, which are but his tenants at will, or to speake more properly, servants to be thrust out of office and state upon the least offence given, or dislike taken. Which condition is farre worse than the former. For a tenant hath some kinde of propriety and interest in that which hee holdeth of his Landlord; and if he performe all covenants, pro∣visoes, and conditions of his lease or agreement with his Lord, hee may not without apparent wrong bee suddenly turned out of house and home, much lesse may his Lord seize upon all his goods, and dispose of them at his pleasure. The case standeth farre worse with a Steward, who hath no∣thing he may call his but his office, for which hee may be alwayes called to an account, and upon it discharged. Yet this is the state of the greatest States and Potentates of the world; they have no certainty in any thing they possesse or enjoy. For which cause SaintHom. 2. ad po. Antioch. Omnes usum et fructum habe∣mus, dominium nemo.Chrysostome findeth great fault with the wills and testaments of great personages in his time, by which they bequeath lands, lordships, and inheritances in their own name and right, as if those things were absolutely in their power: they usurpe, saith hee, upon Gods prerogative, who hath given unto them the use and profit of the things of this life, but not the dominion, no nor propriety in strict point of law, unlesse a man will account that to be his own, for which he is to give an account to another. The Steward is no whit the richer, because hee hath more to account for; but in this regard more solicitous and obnoxious. Which observation we may crowne with this corollary, That they who seem to have the greatest and best estates in this world, are in the worst condition of any, if their gifts be not eminent, and their care and industry extraordinary, to make the best advantage to their Master of the many talents committed to them. The reason hereof is easie to ghesse at, and was long ago yeelded by Gregory theGreg. sup. E∣vang. dominic. Cum augentur dona, crescunt rationes dono∣rum. great, As their means and incomes, so their accounts grow. ForLuke 12.48. To whom men have committed much, of him they will aske the more. to whom more is given, more shall be required of him. To speake nothing of the many imployments and di∣stractions of men in great place, which sacrilegiously robbe them of their sacred houres devoted to prayer and meditation, and bereave them of themselves, I had almost said deprive them of their God, and the sweet fellowship of his holy Spirit: they must give so much audience to others, that they can give but little attendance on God. Publike imployments, and eminent places in Church and Common-wealth expose those that hold them to the view of all men, their good parts, whatsoever they have, are in sight, and their bad too: which men are more given to marke (quis enim solem ferè intuetur, nisi cum deficit? when doe men so gaze upon the Sunne, as in the eclipse?) in so much that the very word Marke is commonly taken in the worst sense for some scarre, blemish, or deformity. A small coale raked up in the ashes may live a great while, which if it be raked out and blowne, soone dyeth and turneth into ashes. They that were kept in close prison by Dionysius, enjoyed the benefit of their sight in those darke roomes, which they lost, when they were suddenly brought forth into the open ayre, by the over bright reflection of the Sunne beames from a wall new white-limed. Which I speake not to detract from dignity, or obscure glory, or disparage nobility, or dishonour worldly preferments or honours
in them, whose merits have been their raisers. For these honourable titles and dignities are the lustre of eminent quality, the garland of true vertue, the crowne of worldly happinesse, and to the lowly, high favours of the Almighty. The marke I aime at is to give some content to them whose places are inferiour to their vertues; and advice also to those whom God hath or shall raise to great places and high preferments. Let the former consider, that there can be no obscurity where the Sunne shineth; that he is truly honourable not alwayes, whom the Prince putteth in high places, but he, upon whom God lifteth the light of his countenance; that it is suffici∣ent that hee seeth their good parts, from whom they expect their reward; that the more retired their life is, the lesse exposed to envie, and more free from danger; that the fewer suters or clients they have to them, the more liberty they have to be clients to God; the lesse troubles they have about their temporall estate, the better they may looke to their spirituall, and secure their eternall: lastly, that the lesse they are trusted with, the easier their account shall be at the great audit. On the other side, let those who have degrees accumulated, and honours and preferments heaped upon them, seeke rather to diminish their accounts, than to increase their re∣ceipts, and pray to God daily for lesse of his goods, and more of his grace, that they may make a better account at the last day, and then receive a Kingdome in Heaven for a Stewardship on earth. Beloved brethren, you see your calling, you are Stewards not Lords, thinke upon it seriously that you may be every day, you shall be one day, called to a strict account for all that you have or enjoy. This was the first point of speciall consideration I recommended to you from the nature of our office, which is here called a Stewardship. The second was, that wee are not Gods Treasurers, but his Stewards, and that our imployment is not to gather up and keep, but to expend and distribute our Masters monies for the maintenance and reliefe of his poore servants, according to their seve∣rall necessities. And looke whatsoever we lay out in this kinde, shallbe al∣lowed upon our accounts, and put upon our Masters score, who acknow∣ledgeth it to bee his owne debt:Mat. 10.42. Whatsoever you doe unto any of these little ones, you doe it unto mee. You clothe mee in the naked, you feed mee in the hungry, you relieve mee in the distressed, you visit mee in the impri∣soned, you ransome mee in the captive, you cure mee in the wounded, you heale my pierced hands and feet with the oyle which you poure in∣to their wounds. Thrice happy Stewards wee, if wee can so handle the matter, that we may bring our Master indebted to us for the interest of his owne mony. For he,Prov. 19.15. who giveth to the poore, lendeth to the Lord, and that which he hath given will he pay it him againe. So exceeding bountifull is he, that he giveth us aboundantly to pay our fellow-servants, and payeth us double for giving it them. After our Saviour had healed the man with aMarke 3 5. withered hand, to shew that it was whole, he commanded him to stretch it forth: in like manner, if wee desire to shew and make a sensible proofe that the sinewes of our faith are not shrunke, that the hands of our charity are not withered, we must stretch them out, and reach our almes to the poore: which we will be more willing and ready to doe, if we reflect often upon our office shadowed out under this Parable; which is to bee Stewards, not
Treasurers of Gods manifold blessings. Secondly, if wee consider that wee lay out nothing of our owne, but of our Masters purse; And thirdly, that whatsoever we lay out for him upon earth, we lay up for our selves hea∣ven: according to that rule of SaintLeo ser. quod. Thesaurum codit in coelo, qui Christum, pascit in pau∣pere: manus pauperis gaa∣phylatium Christi. Leo, Hee layeth up treasure in heaven, who feedeth Christ in the poore; the poore mans hand is Christs boxe. This branch of our duties, which is to be alwayes fruitfull in good workes, ex∣tendeth farther than the expending of monies or good usage of the bles∣sings of this life. For all the members of our body; and faculties of our foule, and graces of the spirit are pa of our Masters goods, and must bee imployed in his service, and occupied for his profit. Besides all these wee are accountable to him for our time, which wee may not wastefully and prodigally lavish out in sports and pastimes; but so thriftily expend upon the necessary workes of our calling, that we may save a good part to con∣secrate it to exercises of piety and devotion, whereby wee may multiply the talent of grace committed unto us. There is no covetousnesse com∣mendable but of time, of which yet most men and women are most prodi∣gallSenec. ep. 1. Quem mihi dabis qui ali∣quod pretium tempori ponat, qui diem aesti∣met? &c. spenders. Any jewell that is lost may be found, yea though it bee cast in the sea, as Polycraes his ring was, which a fish in his mouth brought backe into his Kitchin. Yea, the treasure of grace and pearle of the word, which the rich Merchant sold all that hee had to buy; yea God himselfe af∣ter we have lost him may bee found, if we seeke him in time: onely lost time can never be recovered. Wherefore that wee may not lose any mo∣ment of the time allotted, which is so precious, but put it to the best use for the increase of our talent of knowledge, I passe from the Stewardship of the things of this life, to the account we are to give of this Stewardship. In which that we may more readily and safely proceed, first I will set up a great light: secondly, remove some rubs out of the way. The light shall bee a cleare confirmation of the truth of the point out of the Scriptures, which are most evident and expresse, both for the unavoidable necessity and strict severity of the last judgement. Wee professe in our Creed, that Christ who now sitteth at the right hand of his Father in heaven, shall from thence come to judge the quicke and the dead; and wee have sure ground in Scripture to build this article upon. ForActs 10 42. there wee reade, that Christ is ordained of God to bee Judge of the quicke and the dead: and thatRom. 14.10. we shall all stand before his judgement seat: nay, that wee2 Cor. 5.10. must all ap∣peare before his tribunall: which is so certaine a thing to come to passe, that SaintApoc. 20.12, 13. John in a vision saw it as present; And I saw the dead small and great stand before God, and the bookes were opened, and they were judged according to the things wrote in those bookes. Now for the terrour of that day, I trem∣ble almost to rehearse how it is described in holy Scriptures, by S.Apoc. 20.11. John, I saw a great white throne, and him that sate on it, from whose face the earth and heaven fled away: and by Saint1 Pet. 4.17. Peter, The time is come that judge∣ment must begin at the house of God, and if it begin there, what shall the end of them be that obey not the Gospel? and if the righteous shall scarce bee sa∣ved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appeare? It is hard to say, whether the antecedents are more direfull, or the concomitants more dolefull, or the consequents more dreadfull. The antecedents are formidable: TheMat. 24.29. Sunne shall be darkened, and the Moone shall be turned into bloud, and the
starres shall fall from the skies, and the powers of heaven shall bee shLuk. 21.25, 26. In the earth shall be distresse of Nations, and perplexity, and the sea and t waters shall roare, and mens hearts shall faile them for feare, and for looking after those things that are comming on the earth. The concomitants are lamentable: Behold, heApoc. 1.7. commeth in the clouds, and all eyes shall see him, and all kindreds of the earth shall mourne before him. And yet the conseque are more fearfull than either the antecedants or concomitants. For the bookes of all mens consciences shall be spread abroad, and every man shall answer for all theEccles. 12.14. workes that he hath done, nay for everyMat. 12.36. word he hath spoken, nay for every thought, purpose, and intent of the heart. For when the Lord commeth, he will bring to light the1 Cor. 4.5. hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the heart. Having set up a faire light, I will now take away some blockes and r that lye in the way of my discourse. The first is, that God executeth judge∣ment in this world; and therefore Salvianus hath written a booke De senti Dei judicio, of Gods providence over his Church, and present judge∣ment. Doth hee not open his treasures to the righteous, and poure downe the vialls of his wrath upon the wicked in this life? Doth not Saint Paul affirme, that those that beleeve areRom. 5.1. justified already? And Saint John, that those that beleeve not are condemnedJohn 3.18. already. What place then remaines for a future tryall? Secondly, immediately upon our death our soule is carried either by good Angels into Abrahams bosome, or by evill into the dungeon of hell: what then need they come to the generall assizes who have received their doome at the quarter sessions? Thirdly, if all mens consciences shall bee ripped up, and all their secret sinnes be discovered in the face of the Sunne at the day of judgement, that day cannot be but dreadfull to the most righteous man on earth: yet Christ saith to his Disciples,Luke 21.28. When these things come to passe, lift you up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh: and they in this regard long for his se∣cond comming, and pray continually, Come LordApoc. 22.20. Jesu, come quickly. The first rubbe is thus removed: though Gods judgements overtake some, yet not all in this life. For the afflictions of the godly, and the pro∣sperity of the wicked were a great eye-sore toPsal. 73.12. David andJerem. 5.28. Jeremy Moreover, God hath rewards both temporall and eternall; the former he dispenceth in this life, the later in that which is to come. Hee that belee∣veth is justified already before God, and in the sense of his owne consci∣ence: for he hath peace with God. And in like manner hee that beleeveth not is condemned already in Gods decree, and hee hath received also the sentence of condemnation within himselfe, as a fellon is hanged in the law, and may know what his sentence shall be before it bee executed or pro∣nounced against him. This hindreth not but that the publike sentence shall passe upon both at the last day for eternall salvation or damnation. The second is thus removed: Immediately upon death every soule know∣eth what shee is to trust to, but this it not knowne to the world. Besides, the body must bee rewarded or punished as well as the soule: therefore partly to cleare the justice of God in the sight of men and Angels; partly, to render to the body and soule that have been partners in evill and good
their entire recompence, after the private session at our death, God hath ap∣pointed a publike assizes at the day of judgement. The third rubbe is thus taken away: The day of judgement is both ter∣rible and comfortable to the godly; terrible in the beginning, comfortable in the end: terrible in the accusation by Sathan, comfortable in the defence by Christ our Advocate: terrible in the examination, but comfortable in the sentence. Yea, but their sores are laid open, and they are fowle: their debts are exhibited, and they are very many: their rents in their conscience are shewed, and they are great. It is true, their sores are laid open, but an∣nointed with Balsamum: their debts are exhibited, but with a faire acquit∣tance signed with Christs bloud: their rents in their conscience are seene, but mended and filled up with jewels of grace. It is farre otherwise with the wicked; their sores appeare without any salve; their debts appeare, but no acquittance; their rent in their conscience appeareth, and remaineth as wide as ever it was, being never made up or mended by repentance: there∣fore they cryApoc. 6.16. to the mountaines, fall on us, and to the hills, cover us from the presence of the Lord, and from the wrath of the Lambe. This point of doctrine is not more evident in the proofe, than profitable in the use, which is threefold: 1. To comfort the innocent. 2. To terrifie the secure. 3. To instruct all. First, to comfort the innocent. For many that have walked sincerely be∣fore God have been censured for hypocrites; many innocents have been falsly condemned, many just men have suffered for righteousnesse sake, and many faithfull Christians have been adjudged to mercilesse flames for their most holy profession. To all these the day of judgement will bee the brightest day that ever shone on them. For then their innocency shall break out as the light, and their righteous dealing as the noone day: then they shall have the hand of their false accusers, and judge their Judges: then they shall see him for whom they have stood all their life time, and strived even to bloud. Every losse they have sustained for his sake shall bee then their gaine, every disgrace their honour: for every teare they have shed they shall receive a pearle, for every blew stripe a saphir, for every green wound an emerald, for every drop of bloud a ruby to bee set in their crowne of glory. Secondly, it serveth much for the terrour of the wicked, who goe on confidently in their lewd courses, and proceed from evill to worse, ad∣ding drunkennesse to thirst: let these know, thatRom. 2.5. they heape wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgement of God: and that as the farther backe the axe is fetched, the heavier is the stroake; so the longer their punishment is deferred, the heavier in the end it will fall upon them. Let them who feare not to doe wrong, but carry their sinne with a high hand, bearing themselves upon their wealth, or some potent friend at Court know that they shall be brought to Christs barre ore tenus, and that none upon earth shall be able to rescue them. Let them who lay snares
in the darke, and looke for their prey in the twi-light, and say in their hearts no eye seeth us, know, that God hathApoc. 1.14. eyes like a flaming fire, enlightening the darkest corners of the inmost roomes: and that heePsal. 50.21. will reprove them, and set their sinnes in order before their eyes: and that what they commit in secret, and would not for a world that any witnesses should be by, shall bee brought to an open examination before men and Angels. Thirdly, to instruct all so to live, that they may not feare to come be∣fore the face of God; so to cleare their accounts here, that they need not to dread their examination there. To this use the holy Ghost pointeth,2 Pet. 4.11, 12, 14. Seeing that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought yee to be in all holy conversation? how diligent, that wee may bee found of him in peace without spot and blamelesse? When Alcibiades came to visitEras. Apoph. Atqui inquit potius quem∣admodum rati∣onem non red∣deres, labora∣res. Pericles, and found him very busie about his accounts, Why (saith he) doest thou thus trouble thy selfe in seeking to make up thy accounts? thou shouldest rather use a meanes to put it off, and thinke of a course to free thee from this care, and take order that thou shouldest never bee called to an account. I doubt not but that many Treasurers and Stewards of great Princes make good use of this advice, and by friends and mony so bring it about, that they are never brought to an account. If wee have any such thought wee deceive our selves; there is no dodging with God, no delay, no not for a moment, when hee sendeth his Pursuivant for us from the high Court of Starre-chamber in Heaven: as he (in Saint Gregories dayes) found by woe∣full experience, who being summoned by death approaching to bring in his accounts before they were ready, cryed out pitifully, Inducias vel ad horam, O reprivall but for a day, truce but for an houre, respite but for a mi∣nute: but could not obtaine it, but was suddenly posted away to the judge∣ment seat of Christ: and who of us knoweth whether he shall be the next to whom God will send a messenger to bring him before him to render an account of his Stewardship, saying to him in the words of my Text, Redde rationem dispensationis tuae, Give an account Of thy Stewardship. (Thy.) I know not how it commeth to passe, that most men now a dayes are sicke of Saint Peters disease, when Christ tel∣leth them of their duty, or fore-sheweth them their end, they are inquisi∣tive about others, saying,John 21.21. What shall this man doe? There are divers kindes of Stewards, some of powers, some of wealth, some of knowledge, some of the Word and Sacraments. Kings dominions, and Bishops dio∣cesses, and Lords lands, and Rich mens mony, and Clerkes writings, and Merchants trades, and Tradesmens shops, and Husbandmens ploughes are their Stewardship, of which they must give an account; and yet few there are that minde their owne account to their Master for that wherewith they are trusted: but every man looketh to anothers. The Ploughman censu∣reth the Tradesman, the Tradesman the Merchant, the Merchant the coun∣try Gentleman, the country Gentleman the Courtier, and all the Mini∣sters of God; as if to impeach others were to cleare themselves. At the audit day they will finde that it will little availe them to say, I am no tot quot, I am no joyner of house to house, or land to land, I am no usurer, op∣pressor, or extortioner like other men: when it will be replyed unto them, but thou art like the Pharisee, a deep dissembler, a counterfeit saint, a se∣cret
hypocrite, a slanderous backbiter, a busie-body, an uncharitable censu∣rer, a streigner of a gnat in others, when thy selfe eatest many a flye, nay swal∣lowest many a camell.Plut. tract. de curiosit. Plutarch rightly observeth, that they who delight to gad abroad, for the most part have smoaky, nasty, or dankish houses, or at least ill rule, & no content at home; so when men range abroad, and play the spies and scouts, and pry into other mens actions, it is a signe that they have a foule house at home, and ill rule in their owne conscience. WhereforeStella in Luc. Observa etiam diligenter quod hic non dicit dominus, Redde rationem villi∣cationis alie∣nae, vel redde rationem villi∣cationis alteri∣us, sed villica∣tionis tuae; pro priae enim vitae tuae factorum∣que tuorum, non alienorum redditurus es rationem Deo: unusquisque enim redditu∣rus est de pro∣pris factis rati∣onem. Stella, according to his name Starre, well illustrateth this Text, Give an account of thy Stewardship, not of any other mans: Pry not into his life, set not his actions upon the racke, reade not a lecture upon his manners; but meditate and comment upon the booke of thine owne conscience, that thou mayest make even reckonings there. It is an uncivill part to over-looke o∣ther mens papers, especially bills of account, which no way concerne us: yet there are those that take to themselves a liberty to looke into, and exa∣mine the bookes of other mens conscience, not being able to reade a letter in their owne: herein resembling the crocodile, which seeth nothing in the water, which is his chiefest place of aboad, yet is very quicke and sharpe sighted on the land out of his owne element to doe mischiefe. I will undertake that any man shall have worke enough to cast up his owne ac∣counts, if hee looke into every particular for which hee is to reckon, every stray thought, every idle word, every inconsiderate action & sudden passion. God is not herein like unto many great personages, who seldome or never call their Stewards to an account; or if they call them, they looke over their bookes and bills but sleightly, taking the visus in grosse. For hee will certainly call all men to a most strict and particular account of every mo∣ment of time they have spent, of every particular grace they have recei∣ved, of every particular duty they have omitted, of every particular sinne they have committed in deed, word, or thought, nay of the first motion and inclination to evill. The smallest atomi or moates that flye in the ayre are discerned in the Sunne; so the smallest sinnes and offences shall be dis∣covered at the brightnesse of Christs comming. And as the words that are written with the juyce of a Lemmon, cannot be read when they are writ∣ten, but may be plainly and distinctly if you hold the paper to the fire, and dry the letters; so the smallest letters in the book of our conscience, yea the least notes, and points, and scratches, which neither any other nor our selves see well now, shall easily be discerned by the fire of the last judge∣ment. The conceit whereof tooke such a deep impression in the render heart of Saint Hierome, that he professethVictor. Reat. in vit. Hieron. Sive comedo, sive bibo sive quid aliud fa∣cio, semper vi∣detur mihi tu∣ba illa terribi∣lis sonare, Sur∣gite mortui, & venite ad judi∣cium. wheresoever he was, whatsoever he did, whether he ate or dranke, or walked abroad, or sate in his study, or talked with any, he thought he heard the last Trump sound shrill in his eares, Awake yee that sleep in the dust, and come to judgement. At which time that you may be all more perfect, I would advise you toBarradius comment. in con∣cord Evang. Ascendat mens tribunal judici, rationem ratio exposcat. reckon before hand with your selves, either at private fasts, or every evening. AmongPythag. . Pythago∣ras his golden Verses these seem to mee to be most weighty: Before thou suffer thy temples to take any rest, resolve these three questions, Wherein have I transgressed? What have I done? What part of my duty have I left this day undone?
; According to which rule Seneca recordeth it to the eternall praise of Sextius, that every evening hee put these interrogatories to his soule,Quod hodiè malum sanst? cu vitio obsti∣tisti? qua parte melior factus es? What wound hast thou healed this day? What vice hast thou withstood? Wherein art thou better than thou wert the day before? thus Pythagoras ad∣vised, thus Sextius did, and yet neither of them (for ought appeareth) thought of any other judge than their reason, nor accusers than their thoughts, nor tormentors than their vitious affections, nor hell than their owne conscience. What suppose yee would they have done? what care would they have taken? how oft would they have revised their ac∣counts, if they had thought they should have been brought to answer for all their actions, speeches, gestures, affections, nay thoughts, purposes, intentions, deliberations, and resolutions, before God and his holy Angels at the dreadfull day of judgement? If the consideration of these things no whit affect you, you shall one day give an account among other your sins for the unprofitable hearing of this Sermon. His word which I have prea∣ched unto you this day, shall testifie against you at that day. Give me leave therefore a little to rouze you up, and by applying the steele of my Text to your flinty hearts, to strike out of them the fire of zeale. I told you be∣fore of foure sorts of Stewards, the sacred, the honourable, the wealthy, and the common and ordinary. I will begin with the sacred. 1. Appl. to Mini¦sters.Thou to whom the Oracles of God and soules of men are committed, who hast received grace by imposition of hands, not to gaine applause to thy selfe, or an high step of dignity on earth; but to win soules to God, and bring men to Heaven: thou to whom the mist of blacke darknesse is reserved for ever, if thou departest from the holy commandement, and drawest others after thee; but an eminent place amongst the Starres, if thou turne many to righteousnesse: how is it that thy minde, study and en∣deavour is not to build Gods house, but to raise thine owne; not to adde by the ministery of the Gospel those to the Church that shall be saved, but Imponere Pelion Ossae, to lay steeple upon steeple, and preferment upon preferment, and adde dignity to dignity? either not preaching at all, or like the high Priest in the old Law, entering but once a yeere into the Sanctum sanctorum, or at the most furnishing but some few high Fe∣stivals with some rare and exquisite peeces of stuffe, embroidered with variety of all arts and sciences, save Divinity. Is this to preach Christ crucified? Is this toJohn 21.16, 17. feed, feed, and feed? is this to be2 Tim 4.2. instant in season, and out of season; to reprove, rebuke, to exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine? is this toActs 20.27. I have not shunned to declare unto you all the coun∣sell of God. declare the whole counsell of God? is this to1 Tim. 4.13. attend to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, to continue in them? is this to give themselves wholly to the worke of the Ministery, that their profiting may appeare unto all? is this toActs 20.31. warne every one publikely, and house by house, day and night with teares to save themselves from the corruption of the world, & the snares of Sathan, & wrath to come? Will a purchased dis∣pensation of absence from thy Cure upon some plausible pretence, or thy Curates diligence excuse thy supine negligence, or secure thee from
the Apostles1 Cor. 9.16. Vae, Woe be to mee Paul, if I preach not the Gospel in mine owne person? O thinke upon it in time to make a better reckoning be∣fore thou be summoned to give up the last accounts in the words of my Text, Give an account of thy Stewardship, of thy Ministery. Next to the sacred Steward commeth in the minister of State and Ma∣gistrate to bee rounded in the eare with the admonition in my Text.2. To Magistrates. Thou to whom both the Tables are committed, who art ordained by God, and appointed by thy Soveraigne to see religion maintained, justice executed, and peace kept: how commeth it to passe that the sword of justice lyeth rusty in the scabard, and is not drawne out against Sabbath-breakers, contemners of the Church discipline, blasphemers, swearers, drunkards, lewd and scandalous livers? Doest thou use the authority committed to thee to revenge thy selfe, and not to redresse wrongs done to the law? nay doest thou protect and bolster iniquity and impiety? doest thou live by those sinnes, and draw a revenue by licensing those pla∣ces of disorder, which thou art made a minister of justice to suppresse? Is this to be a man fearing God, and hating covetousnesse? is this to stop the mouth of impiety? to cleanse the sinkes of impurity? to purge out the filth that is in the skirts of Jerusalem? to reforme all abuses, and to prevent Gods judgements upon this Realme, by punishing all the viola∣ters of his lawes? Remember that thou who here sittest upon the bench, shalt one day be called to the barre, to be tryed for eternall life or death before the Judge of all flesh, from whose face the heavens and the earth fled, and their place could no where bee found. O thinke in time to make a better reckoning before thy summons to give in thy last account in the words of my Text, Give an account, &c. viz. of thy authority and com∣mission. After the Ministers of the Gospel and the Magistrate,3. To the rich and covetous. come the rich of this world to be admonished to looke to their accounts. Thou whom thy Master hath trusted with much of his goods and coine, to beautifie his Sanctuary, to maintaine them that serve at his Altar, and to stay and si∣lence the lowd cryes and deep sighes of the hungry, thirsty, naked, op∣pressed, imprisoned, and captivated members of thy Redeemer; doest thou bury thy mony under the ground, or locke it up in thy iron chest till it rust? Doest thou like the Gryphine in the naturall story keep others from the precious metall, whereof thy selfe makest no use at all? ThouCypr. de clee∣mos. Servas pe∣cuniam, quae te servata non servat, &c. savest the mony, which being saved will not save thee, and losest by kee∣ping it the blessing of God, the prayers of the poore, nay thine owne soule, by preferring thy Mammon, and setting it in thine owne affection before thy Saviour. How canst thou give an account of thy Stewardship, who hast laid out nothing for thy Masters use; who yet will certainly question thee as well pro lucro cessante, as pro damno emergente, as well for not imploying his mony for his advantage, as for that thou hast im∣ployed to losse? In which regard SaintJames 5.1. James ringeth them a sad peale after the passing bell hath gone for them, Goe to now you rich men, weep and howle for the miseries that shall come upon you; your riches are corrup∣ted, your garments moth-eaten, your gold and silver is cankered, and the rust of them shall be a witnes against you, and shall eate your flesh as it were fire.
4. To the Prodi∣gall.Here let not the prodigall spender vainly flatter himselfe, that his con∣dition shall be easier at the day of judgement than that of the covetous; be∣cause he suffereth not his mony to rust: but rather causeth it to glissen in his plate, glare in his jewells, glitter in his apparrell, shine in his gilt rooms, cabbinets, furnitures and hangings. For all this lustre shall bee a cleare evi∣dence against him of his wasting his Masters substance; and if it shall goe hard with the hard and covetous man, who layeth not out his Masters mo∣ny, what may this exhauster expect? if the Miser shall suffer as aCypr de elec∣mos. Sacrilegi∣um est rem pauperum non dare pauperi∣bus. sacrile∣gious person, because he giveth not the poore their due, what punishment is he like to endure, who robbeth the Church, racketh his tenants, oppresseth the poore, extorteth from, or exacteth upon all, to maintaine either his vain glorious pride, or delicate pallate, or idle sports, or impure pleasures? How many hunger and cold starved poore will have an action against this Stew∣ard, for preferring his Hawkes and Hounds before them: and riotously expending that in one luxurious feast, which would have fed them for many yeeres: and laying out that in one costly sute or rich jewell, wherewith hundreds of them might have been clothed in the bitterest winter season, and thereby their lives preserved? how will they be ashamed and confoun∣ded at the great audit day, to deliver in an account after this manner? In vain sports thus much, in satisfying my lust thus much, to make ostentati∣on of my greatnesse thus much, to be revenged of my enemies thus much, for maintenance of Gods worship not the tenth of my tenth, nay not the hundreth part of my rapines, for the reliefe of the poore a trifle, in vo∣luntary oblations nothing at all. O thinke upon this in time, that you may make better reckonings before you bee summoned to give in your last accounts in the words of my Text, Give an account of thy Steward∣ship, of thy wealth and worldly blessings. 5. To all men in generall.Are all dispensers of the Word and Sacraments? are all in authority? are all commanders? have all the wealth of the world? surely no: yet all are accountants; some for their trade and course of life, others for their na∣turall parts and gifts, and all for their time. Few I perswade my selfe can give a good account of the first, fewer of the second, but fewest of all of the third. It was spoken by a Heathen of the Heathen, but I feare it may be truely said of many Christians in profession,Sen. ep. 1. ad Lucil. Magna pars vitae labi∣tur malè agen∣tibus, maxima nihil agenti∣bus, tota aliud agentibus. that they spend a great part of their life in sinfull actions, the greatest in idlenesse, the whole in imper∣tinent businesse. The dearest losse of all is of time: because if wee have imbe∣zelled our estate by ill husbandry, we may repaire it by thrift and industry; if we have pawned our plate, and houshold-stuffe, & jewells, they may be redeemed againe; if we have morgaged our lands, the morgage may be sa∣tisfied, and our lands restored: but the time that we have idlely, or lewdly, or loosely spent can never bee recovered. No man need Bellerophon like spurre a flying horse, time posteth of it selfe: yet many men not content to let time goe from them in her swiftest motions, they drive her out, and de∣vise how they may set her packing, and bee soonest rid of her; like theAelian. var. hist. l. 1. Persian King, who proposed a great reward to any that could invent any new pastime, they highly value such companions with whom they may lavish out the flower and best of their time. The account of these brave Gallants, and noble Sparkes, as they are termed, is soone cast. Halfe the night
gamed and revelled, and as much of the day slept out, and the remainder indifferently shared between the Taverne and the Play, and the worst of the three. Neither can the other sexe give an account much better,6. To Women. whose day after a ramisticall dichotomy being divided into forenoone and after∣noone: the former part is usually taken up in dressing, trimming, and I feare in that for which they have no colour in holy Scriptures, nor the example of the best times, painting; the later in idle visits, and seeking after the fa∣shions. They allow themselves little time for the contemplation of any thing save their face and dresses in their glasses, nor trouble they their heads with any thing so much as their tiring. In summe, they spend all their time in a manner in beautifying and adorning their body to please their lovers, but in comparison none at all in beautifying and adorning their soules to please their Maker and Husband Christ Jesus. Of these SaintJames 5.5. James long ago gave us the character, They live in pleasure in the earth, and waxe wan∣ton, and are fatted for the day of slaughter. I spare to rehearse other lavi∣shing out of time, lest the rehearsing thereof might seeme worthy to bee numbred among the idle expences thereof. And now it is time to set the foot to the account of my meditations on this Scripture,The Conclusion. and draw neere to that which we all every day draw neerer, unto an end. The1 Pet. 4.7. end of all things is at hand: be sober therefore, & watch unto prayer. The day of the Lord will come as a theefe in the night, in the which the heavens shall passe away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the workes thereof shall be burned up. This great Doomes-day cannot bee farre off, as wee see by the fearfull fore-runners thereof: howsoever the day of our death, which may be called little doomes-day, will soon overtake us; peradventure before the Sunne yet set, or this glasse be runne. Where∣fore, I beseech you all that heare mee this day, in the feare of God, by occa∣sion of the summons in my Text, to enter into a more strict examination of your life than ever heretofore: bring out all your thoughts, words, deeds, projects, councels and designes, and lay them to the rule of Gods Law; and if they swerve never so little from it, reforme and amend them: re∣count how you have bestowed the blessings of this life, how you have imployed the gifts of nature, how you have increased your talents of grace, wherein the Church or Common-wealth hath been the better by you; consider how you have carried your selves abroad in the world, how at home in your private families, but how especially in the closet of your owne heart. You know out of the Gospel, that a mansMat. 12.44. house may be swept and garnished, that is, his outward conversation civill and faire, and yet harbour seven uncleane spirits within. If lust, and covetousnesse, and pride, and envie, and malice, and rancour, and deceit, and hypocrisie, like so many serpents lye under the ground, gnawing at the root of the tree, be the leaves of your profession never so broad, and seem the fruits of your actions ne∣ver so faire, the vine is the vine of Sodome, and the grape the grape of Gomor∣rah. There is nothing so easie, as to put a fresh colour upon a rotten post, and to set a faire glosse upon the fowlest matters, to pretend conscience for most unconscionable proceedings, and make religion it selfe a maske to hide the deformity of most irreligious practices. But when the secrets of all hearts shall be opened, and the intents and purposes of all our actions mani∣fested,
and the most hidden workes of darknesse brought to light. As it is to bee hoped, that many that are infinitely wronged in the rash censures of men, shall be justified in the sight of God and his Angels; so it is to be fea∣red, that very many whom the world justifieth and canonizeth also for Saints, shall be condemned at Christs barre, and have their portion with hy∣pocrites in hell: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Wherefore sith we shall all one day come to such a publike, such an impartiall, such a parti∣cular tryall of all that we have done in the body, either good or evill: let us looke more narrowly to all our wayes, and see that they be streight and even. 1. Let us search our heart with all diligence, let us look into all the cor∣ners thereof, and see there lurke no wickednesse, nor filthinesse, nor hypo∣crisie there: let us looke to our thoughts, that they be pure: to our desires, that they be lawfull: to our affections, that they be regular: to our passions, that they be moderate: to our ends, that they be good: to our purposes, that they be honest: to our intentions, that they be sincere: to our resolu∣tions, that they be well grounded and firme. 2. Next, let us take our tongue to examination, and weigh all our words in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and try whether they have not been light and idle, but grave and profitable: not crafty and deceitfull, but simple and plaine: not false and lying, but true and faithfull: not outragious, but so∣ber: not filthy, but modest: not prophane, but holy: not censorious, but charitable: not scurrilous, but ponderous: not insolent, but lowly and courteous: not any way offensive and unsavoury, but such as mightEphes. 4.29. mini∣ster grace to the hearers. 3. Lastly, let us lay our hands upon our handy workes, and examine our outward acts and deeds. 1. Whether they have been alwayes justifiable in generall by the Law of God, that is, either commanded by it, or at least warranted in it. 2. Whether they have been and are conformable to the orders of the Church, and lawes of the Land. For wee must obey lawfull autho∣rity for conscience sake, in all things that are not repugnant to the divine Law, as Bernard piously resolveth, saying, Thou must yeeld obedience to him as to God, who is in the place of God, in those things that are not against God. 3. Whether they have been agreeable to our particular calling. For some things are justifiable by the Law of God and man in men of one state and calling, which are hainous sinnes in another: as we see in the cases of Uzza and Uzziah. 4. Whether they have been answerable to our inward purposes, inten∣tions and dispositions. For though they are otherwise lawfull and agreeable, yet if they goe against the haire, if they are done with grudging and repining, and not heartily, they are neither acceptable to God nor man. 5. Whether they have been (all things considered) most expedient. For as many things are profitable and expedient that are not law∣full; so some things are lawfull that are not1 Cor. 6.12. All things are lawfull unto me, but all things are not expedient. expedient: and because they are not expedient, if necessity beare them not out, they become
by consequent unlawfull. For we are not onely bound to eschew all the evill we know, but also at all times to doe the best good wee can: else wee fulfill not the commandement of loving God with all our heart, and all our soule, and all our strength. To summe up all. I have discoursed unto you, first, of the Stewardship of the things of this life: secondly, of the account of this Stewardship: thirdly, of the time of this account. The Stewardship most large, the ac∣count most strict, the time most uncertaine. After the explication of these points, in the application I arraigned foure Stewards before you: first, the sacred: secondly, the civill: thirdly, the wealthy: fourthly, the ordinary: and found them all very tardy and imperfect in their accounts: which that you might not be, I but even now delivered unto you the rule of three, or golden rule, as it is called in sacred algebray, whereby you may easily num∣ber your dayes, and cast up your accounts, and infallibly perfect the bookes of your conscience. What remaineth, but that at your first and best opportu∣nity you fall on this worke, cast your accounts privately in the chamber of your heart, peruse the booke of your conscience, mend what is amisse by unfained and hearty repentance, fetch out all the blots and blurres there with the aqua fortis of your teares: and if yet there remaine any thing which you cannot well account for, to meet your Master before hand upon your knees, and beseech him to put it upon his Sonnes score, and to satisfie himselfe out of the infinite treasury of his merits, or to wipe it out with the spunge that was offered him on the Crosse? This if yee practise daily, and make even with God every night; you shall be perfect and ready when your Master shall call for your accounts: and you shall be found of him in peace, and he shall then say unto you, Well done good and faithfull Stewards, yee have been faithfull in a little, I will set you over much: yee have been faithfull in temporall, I will trust you with eternall goods: yee have been faithfull in earthly, I will commit to you heavenly treasures: yee have been faithfull in a Stewardship, I will give you a Kingdome: enter into your Ma∣sters joy. Into which God grant we may all enter, when we are passed out of this vale of teares, through the merits of Christs death and passion, by the conduct of his holy Spirit. To whom, three persons and one God, &c.
PHILIP HIS MEMENTO MORI: OR, The Passing Bell. A Sermon preached in Mercers Chappell at the Funerall of Master Benet, Merchant. THE XXII. SERMON. DEUT. 32.29. O that they were wise, then they would understand this, they would consider their later end. Right Worshipfull, &c. HEnoch lived by just computation so many yeeres as there are dayes in the yeere, viz. 365. and he was the seventh man from Adam, and dyed in annoSethus Calvis. in Chron. Sabba∣thico, the Sabbathick yeere, and thereby became a lively Embleme both of this life, and the life to come. For the labours of this life are governed by the course of the Sunne, which is finished in that period of time; and the rest of the life to come is evidently prefigured in the Sabbath. It is farther written of him in the holy Records of eter∣nity, that heHeb. 11.5. Gen. 5.24. walked with God, and was therefore translated that hee should not see death, to teach us, that they who walke with God all the dayes of their life as he did, shall come into no condemnation, but immediately passe from death to life, from death temporall to life eternall, which was not ob∣scurely disciphered unto us in the narration of the seventh dayes creation. After the mention of every day in the weeke, and the worke thereof, wee
reade, so the evening and the morning were the first day, and so theGen. 1.5, 8, 13.19, 23, 31. second, and the rest: but after the relation of the seventh dayes creation, on which God rested and blessed and sanctified it, the former clause is quiteGen 2.1, 2, 3. omitted. It is not added as in the rest, so the morning and the evening were the se∣venth day: because in Heaven, whereof the Sabbath was a type, there is no morning and evening, much lesse night; but as it were perpetuall high-noon. For theApoc. 21.23. Lambe is the light thereof, and this Lambe is theMal. 4.2. Sunne of righ∣teousnesse, which never riseth nor setteth, but keepeth still in the midst of the Empyreall Heaven and Throne of God: as on the contrary, in Hell there is nothing but continuall midnight and everlasting darknesse. Thus the wisedome of God justly, and the justice of God wisely hath proportio∣ned the rewards in the life to come to the workes of men in this life: they that cast off the works of darknesse, and put on the armour of light, and walk in the light as children of the light here, shall hereafter possesse the inheritance of theColos. 1.12. Saints in light; but they who love darknes more than light, and have fellowship with the unfruitfull workes of darknesse, and continually walke as in the darke, in grosse and palpable ignorance, in gluttony and drunkennesse, in chambering and wantonnesse, and the like sinnes of darknesse here, shall hereafter inhabit the region of perpetuall darknesse, and never vanishing shadowes of death. O that we were wise, then we would understand these things, and in the beginning of our race in this world thinke of ourn. ep. 30. Ut mortem nun∣quam times, semper cogita. later end. For the beginning of wisedome is the consideration of our end; and a forcible meanes to bring us to everlasting life, is to meditate continually upon our death. To thinke what wee shall be, stench and rottennesse, and worse if we be not better, ashes and cinders of hell, will through the power of Christs death make us what we should be, that is, dead to sinne, dead to the world, dead in our selves, but alive in God. How can hee live in sinne, who perpetually apprehendeth that hee shall dye eternally for his sinne? how can he make a trade of iniquity, and a sport of religion, and a mock of God, and a god of his belly, who hath hell torments alwayes before the eyes of his minde?Lament. 1.9. Jerusalem remembred not her last end; therefore shee came downe fearfully: and because wee put from us the evill day, it com∣meth fast upon us. It were unpossible to goe on forward as wee doe in the wayes of sinne and pathes of death, if wee would dwell but a little while upon these or the like thoughts: After a few dayes, perhaps this very day, yea this houre, I shall be called to a strict account of my whole life, charged with all the sinnes open and secret that ever I have committed, accused by the Divell, convicted by mine owne conscience, condemned by the dread∣full Judge of quicke and dead, to be cast into utter darknesse in hell, there to endure such torments for ever, as it would breake the strongest heart, and conquer all humane patience to feele but for an houre. Haec cogitare est vitiis omnibus renunciare, to enter into a serious consideration of these things, is to chase away all wanton and wicked thoughts and to send a bill of divorce to the world and all her minions, the mistresses of our carnall affections: but this is the mischiefe, as S.Cyp. de mortal. Aeterna tor∣menta nemo cogitat, quae metueret con∣scientia si cre∣deret, si metu∣eret caveret, si caveret evade∣ret. Cyprian pricking the right veine telleth us, it is a thing to be bewailed with teares of bloud, that none almost mindeth everlasting torments. For did they minde them and beleeve them, they could not but feare them, and if they feared them y would
beware of them; and if they would beware of them, they might escape them. O that men therefore were wise, to thinke upon hell before they rushed on the brinke of it, and enter into a serious consideration of Gods fearfull judgements upon obstinate and impenitent sinners before they were overtaken by them. This is the scope and effect of these words, and I pray God they may worke this effect in us, that laying before our eyes the fear∣full ends of the wicked, and their damnation, wee may learne from hence∣forth to be wise unto salvation. The unum necessarium and chiefe point of all to be thought upon in this life is, what shall become of us after wee goe from hence: for here (God knowes) we have but a short time to stay. We reade in KingEccles. 3.1.2. Solomons di∣stribution of time, according to the severall occasions of mans life, to every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven, a time to be borne, and a time to dye: but wee reade of no time to live, as if our death bordered upon our birth, and our cradle stood in our grave; yet upon this moment rather than time of our life dependeth eternity. Division.The greatest perfection attainable by man in this life is wisedome, and the most proper act of wisedome is consideration, and the chiefest point of consideration is our later end. First therefore the Spirit of God in this Text commendeth wisedome to their desires. Secondly, consideration to their wisedome. Thirdly, their later end to their consideration: and the more to stirre up their affections and expresse his, he delivereth this his ad∣vice in a wish, and accompanieth it with a deep sigh, saying, O that they were wise, they would understand this, that it is not for their sakes that they might bragge, but for their enemies sake that they might not bragge, that I have thus long spared them. For I had long ere this scattered them a∣broad, and made their remembrance cease from amongst men, but that I knew their adversaries would take advantage thereat, and waxe proud upon it,Verse 27. and say our high hand, and not the Lord hath done it. For they are a Nation void of councell, neither is there any understanding in them. Which words beare a light before the words of my Text,Coherence. and thus bring them in: O that they were wise, then they would understand this, viz. that nothing standeth between them and my wrath, my wrath and their destruction, but the pride of their enemies: they are indebted to the fury, malice, and insolency of the Heathen, who seeke utterly to destroy them, and by proudly treading upon their neckes, to trample true religion under feet, that hell raines not downe upon them from heaven, and they not burnt like Sodome, and consumed like Gomorrah. Were they wise, they would understand it, and understanding consider how neere they are to their end, and considering it meet the Lord upon their knees, to prevent their utter overthrow. Observ. 1.O that they were so wise. If those words wherewith Moses beginneth his Swan-like song immediately before his death,Verse 2. My doctrine shall drop as the raine, and my speech shall distill as the dew, as the small raine upon the tender herbe, and as the showers upon the grasse, were verified of any of his words, they are certainly of these in my Text, which drop like raine, or rather like hoy from his mouth: whereby wee may taste how sweet the Lord is in his speeches, how milde in his proceedings, how passionate in his perswa∣sions,
what force of art & eloquence he useth to draw us unto him, without force & violence. Are not sighes the very breath of love? are not sobs the accents of grief? are not groanes fetched deep the long periods of sorrowes ravishing eloquence? which Almighty God breathes out of the boyling heat of his affection both here and elsewhere: OHos. 6.4. Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, how shall I intreat thee? for your righteousnesse is as a morning cloud, & your goodnes as an earthly dew vanisheth away. O thatPsal. 81.13, 14, 15, 16. my people had hearkened unto mee, and Israel had walked in my wayes. I should soone have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adver∣saries. The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. Hee should have fed them with the fi∣nest of the wheat, and with honey out of the rocke would I have satisfied thee. And, OMat. 23.37. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the Prophets, and stonest those that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her chickens under her wings, but yee would not? How can the affection more outwardly enlarge, or the heart open it selfe, than by opening the bosome, and stretching out the armes to imbrace? Behold theEsay 65.2. armes of Almighty God stretched all the day long to a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their owne thoughts. What truer Embassadours of a bleeding heart than weeping eyes? behold the teares of our Saviour over Jerusalem, and reach your hand, and thrust it in∣to the hole of his side, and you shall feele drops from his heart bleeding a∣fresh for your ungratefull refusall of his love, and despite of his grace. If drops of raine pierce the stones, and drops of warme Goats bloud crumble the Adamant into pieces; shall not Christs teares sinke into our affections, and the drops of his heart bloud breake our hearts with godly sorrow, and make them so thorougly contrite by unfained repentance, that they may be an acceptable sacrifice unto him? according to the words of the Psalmist,Psal. 51.17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou shalt not despise. Were not that City very unwise, that would re∣fuse any tolerable conditions of peace offered by a potent enemy, against whm shee could not make her party good in warre? Beloved, are wee a∣ble to hold out warre with Almighty God? to maintaine a fight against his plagues and judgements? what are we but dead men, if hee lay hold on his glittering sword? why then doe wee not come in whilest hee holdeth out his golden Scepter of mercy? why sue wee not to him for a treatie of peace? It can be no disparagement to us to seeke to him first; yet we need not, he seeketh to us first, he maketh an overture of his desire for peace, he draweth conditions with his owne hand, and offereth them to us, as wee heard before out of the 81. Psalme, If Israel would have walked in my waies, &c. that is, if you will yeeld to mee, and acknowledge mee for your Lord, and accept of my lawes, I will take the protection of you a∣gainst all your bodily and ghostly enemies, I will secure you from all dan∣ger, enrich you with grace, give you all the contentment you desire upon earth, and preferre you to a crowne of glory in heaven. Can you desire fairer conditions than these? know yee who it is that tendereth them? he is your Lord and Maker, who need not condition with you; that which hee meekly craves he could powerfully force you unto; hee sueth for that
by entreaty, which hee may challenge by right; all that hee requireth on our part is but our bounden duty, and his desire is that we should bind him to us for doing that service which wee are bound to doe. Was there ever such a creditour heard of, that would come in bonds for his owne debt, and become a debtour to his debtour? SaintAug l 5. con∣fes. c. 9. Dignaris quoniam in seculum mise∣ricordia tua est iis quibus om∣nia debita di∣mittis promis∣sionibus tuis debitor fieri. Austin could not hold when he fell upon this meditation, but breaketh out into a passion, Thou vouchsafest, O Lord, by thy promises to become debtour to them, to whom thou remittest all debts. What happinesse! what honour is it to have Almighty God come in bonds to us? I beseech you thinke what they deserve who set light by so great a favour, and refuse such love. Applica∣tion.Now God maketh as it were love to us, and in dolefull Sonnets com∣plaines of our unkindnesse, O that my people would have hearkened to my voice, &c. To which his amorous expostulations if wee now turne a deafe eare, the time will come when wee shall take up the words of God in our owne persons, and with hearts griefe and sorrow say, O that we had hearke∣ned to the Lord, O that we had walked in his wayes; then should we have seen the felicity of his chosen, and rejoyced with the joy of his people, and glo∣ried with his inheritance: but now wee behold nothing but the misery of his enemies, and are confounded with the shame of reprobates, and suffer the torments of the damned, and shall till wee have satisfied to the utmost farthing. Now God wooeth us with deepest protestations of love, and lar∣gest promises of celestiall graces, which if we make light of, it will one day fall heavie upon us. The sweetest wine corrupteth into the sharpest vine∣gar, and the most fragrant oyntments, if they putrefie, exhale most pesti∣lent savours; and greatest love, if it be wronged, turneth into the greatest hatred. Now God as a lover passionately wooeth us, but if wee sleighten him, and despise his kinde offers, he will change his note, and turne his wooe into a woe, as we heare,Hos. 7.13. Woe be unto them, for they have fled away from mee; destruction shall be unto them, because they have rebelled against mee: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lyes against mee. After the clearest flash of lightening followeth the terriblest clap of thunder: in like maner af∣ter Gods mercy in Scripture hath for a long time lightened, & most clearly shewed it selfe to any people or nation, his justice thundereth out most dreadfull threats. For example: after Gods familiar disputation with his Vineyard,Esay 5.1, 2, 3, 4. My beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitfull hill, and hee fen∣ced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine-presse therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wilde grapes. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, & men of Judah, judge I pray you between me & my Vineyard, what could I have done more to my Vineyard that I have not done? &c. mark the fearfull conclusion (Verse 5.) I will tell you what I will do to my Vineyard, I will take away the hedge thereof, & it shall he eaten up, I will breake downe the wall thereof, and it shall be troden downe. And what ensued upon our Saviours teares over Jerusalem, which would not sinke into their stony hearts, but the bloudy tragedy which was acted upon them 40. yeeres after by the Romans? who spared neither the an∣nointed head of the Priest, nor the hoary head of the aged, nor the weaker sexe of women, nor the tender age of infants; but put all to the sword,
sacked the walls, rifled the houses, burned the Temple downe to the ground, and left not one stone upon another. O that wee were wise, then wee would understand, and observe the method of Gods proceedings, and in the ruine of Gods people, if wee repent not, consider our later end. O that they were Wise. The Philosophers distinguish wisedome into , Sapience. , Prudence. Sapience they define to be the knowledge of all divine & humane things, so farre as they fall within the scantling of mans reason. Prudence they restraine to the ordering of humane affaires: and this they divide into 1. Private, 2. Publike: and this they subdivide into 1. Civill, 2. Military. Military prudence maketh a wise souldier, civill a wise statesman, do∣mesticke a wise housholder, and sapience a wise contemplative, and mo∣rall prudence in generall a wise practick man. The rules of this wisedome are to be taken from the precepts of Philosophy, discourses of Policy, the apophthegmes & stratagems, sentences and examples of those whom the world hath cryed up for Sages; but this is not the wisedome which Moses here requireth in Gods people, and passionately complaineth of the want of it: but a wisedome of a higher nature, or, to speake more properly, a wisedome above nature, a wisedome which descendeth from the Father of lights, which directeth us so to order and governe our short life here, that thereby we may gaine eternity hereafter: so to worship and serve God in Christ in this world, that we may reigne with him in the world to come. The infallible rules of this wisedome are to be fetched onely from the in∣spired Oracles of God extant in the Old and New Testament: the chiefe whereof are these; 1. To receive and entertaine the doctrine of salvation,Rules of spirituall wisedome. which is the wise∣dome of God in a mystery, confuting the errours, and convincing the folly of all worldly wise men. 2. To deny our selves, and our carnall wisedome and reason, and bring eve∣ry thought in obedience to the Gospel. 3. To account our selves strangers and pilgrimes here upon earth, and so to use this world as though wee used it not. 4. To know, that we are not Lords of our lands, wealth and goods, but only Stewards, to account for them: and therefore so to dispense and distribute them, that we make friends of unrighteous Mammon, that when it faileth us, they may receive us into everlasting habitations. 5. To seeke the Lord whilest hee may bee found, and not to de∣ferre our repentance from day to day.
6. To be sure to provide for our eternall state, whatsoever becommeth of our temporall; and to preferre the salvation of our soule before the gaining of the whole world. 7. To examine daily our spirituall estate, and to informe our selves truly how we stand in the Court of Heaven, in Gods favour, or out of it. 8. To observe to what sinnes wee are most subject; and where wee are weakest, there continually to fortifie against Sathans batteries. 9. In all weighty occasions, especially such as concerne our spirituall estate, to aske counsell of God, and take direction from his Word. 10. To consider the speciall workes of Gods providence in the carriage of the affaires of this world, and make use thereof to our selves. 11. Lastly, to meditate upon the Law of God all the dayes of our life, and consider their blessed end that keep it with their whole heart; and their accursed death that transgresse it. And so I fall upon the second branch of my Text: They would consider. I have already proposed wisedome to your desires: now I am to commend consideration to your wisedome. The Schoole Divines make this the speciall difference between the knowledge of men and Angels, that the knowledge of Angels is intuitive, but of men discur∣sive: they see all things to which the beame of their sight extendeth, as it were on the sudden with one cast of the eye; but we by degrees see one thing after another, and inferre effects from causes, and conclusions from principles, and particulars from generalls: they have the treasures of wise∣dome and knowledge ready alwayes at hand; we by reading, hearing, con∣ference, but especially by meditation must digge it out of the precious mynes where it lyeth. In which regard Barradius, alluding to the sound of the word though not to the Grammaticall originall, saith, meditatio est quasi mentis ditatio, meditation is the enriching of the soule, because it delves into the rich mynes of wisedome, and maketh use of all that wee heare or reade, and layeth it up in our memories. Seneca fitly termeth it rumination, or chewing of the cud, which maketh the food of the soule taste sweeter in the mouth, and digest better in the stomacke. By the Law of God theLevit. 11.3, 7. beasts that chewed not the cud were reckoned among the unclean, of which the people of God might not eate: such are they in the Church, that never ruminate, or meditate upon those things they take in at the eare, which is the soules mouth. I know no difference more apparent between a wise man and a foole than this, that the one is prometheus, hee adviseth before; the other is epimetheus, he acteth first, and deliberateth afterwards, andHesiod. . wardeth after hee hath received the wound: the one doth all things headily and rashly; the other maturely and advisedly. A man that hath an understanding spirit, calleth all his thoughts together, and holdeth a cabinet councell in the closet of his heart, and there propoundeth, debateth, deliberateth and resolveth what hee hath to doe, and how, before hee im∣barke himselfe into any great designe, or weighty affaire. For want of this preconsideration most men commit many errours, and fall into great inconveniences, troubles and mischiefes, and are often caught unawares in the Divels snare; which they might easily have shunned, if they had looked before they leaped, and fore-casted their course before they entred into it.
It is a lamentable thing to see how many men, partly through carelesnesse and incogitancie, partly through a desire to enjoy their sensuall pleasures without any interruption, suffer Sathan like a cunning Faulkner to put a hood upon their soules, and therewith blind the eyes of the understanding; and never offer to plucke it off, or stirre it, before hee hath brought them to utter darknesse. O that men were wise to understand this cunning of the Divell,Applica∣tion. and consi∣der alwayes what they doe before they doe it: and be they never so reso∣lutely bent, and hot set upon any businesse, yet according to the advice of theCic. Orat. pro Pub. Quint. Si haec duo solùm verba tecum habuisses, Quid ago? respirasset credo cupidi∣tas, &c. Orator, to give their desires so long a breathing time, till they have spoken these two words to themselves, Quid agimus? what doe we? what are we about? is it a commendable worke? is it agreeable to the Word of God? and sutable to our calling? is it of good report? and all circumstan∣ces considered expedient? if so, goe on in Gods name, and the Lord pro∣sper your handy-workes: but if otherwise, meddle not with it, and put off all that the Divell or carnall wisedome can alledge to induce you unto it, with these checkes of your own consciences, saying to your selves, Shall we offend God? shall we charge our consciences? shall we staine our re∣putation? shall we scandalize our profession? shall we despite the Spirit of grace? shall we forfeit our estate in Gods promises, and foregoe a title to a Kingdome? shall wee pull downe all Gods plagues and judgements upon us in this life, and hazzard the damnation of body and soule in hell; and all this for an earthly vanity, a fading commodity, a momentary plea∣sure, an opinion of honour, a thought of contentment, a dreame of hap∣pinesse? Shall we bett with the Divell, and stake our soules against a tri∣fle? shall we venture our life, and put all the treasures of Gods grace, and our crowne of glory in the Divels bottome, for such light and vile mer∣chandize as this world affordeth? Is it not folly, nay madnesse to lay out all upon one great feast, knowing that we should fast all the yeere after? to venture the boiling in the river of brimstone for ever, for bathing our selves in the pleasures of sinne for an houre? We forbid our children to eate fruit, because we say it breedeth wormes in their bellies: and if wee had the like care of the health of our soules, as of their bodies, wee would for the same reason abstaine from the forbidden fruit of sinne, because it breedeth in the conscience a never dying worme. O that we were wise to understand this, and to Consider our later end. I have proposed wisedome to your desires in the first place; and in the second referred consideration to your wisedome: now in the last place I am to recommend your later end to your consideration. A wise man beginneth with the end, which is first in the intention, but last in the execution: and as we judge of stuffes by their last, so of all courses by their end to which they tend. It is not the first or middle, but the last scene that denominateth the play a tragedy or a comedy: and it is the state of a man at his death and after, upon which wee are to passe judgement, whether he be happy or miserable. No man knoweth who hath gotten honour or infamy, till the race is runne; but after the course is finished, when the rewards are distributed to every man according to his worke, when they that have kept within the wayes of God, and held on straight
to the price of their high calling, receive an incorruptible crowne of glory: but they who have turned out of the right way to pursue earthly vanities, receive their wages, eternall death; then all men shall see who was the wi∣ser of the two, and tooke the better course: then the wicked themselves shall confesse their beastly folly, thus rubbing upon their owne sores, and fretting their owne wounds, as we reade in the booke of Wisedome; And they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shall say within them∣selves,Wisd. 5.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. This was he whom we had sometimes in derision, and a Proverbe of reproach. We fooles accounted his life madnesse, and his end to bee without honour. How is he numbred among the children of God, and his lot is among the Saints? Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the light of righteousnesse hath not shined unto us, and the sun of righteousnesse rose not upon us. We wearied our selves in the way of wickednesse and destruction: yea, we have gone through desarts, where there lay no way; but as for the way of the Lord, we have not knowne it. What hath pride profited us? or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us? All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a Poste that hasted by. And as a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, which when it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot bee found: neither the path-way of the keele in the waves. Where is now our gay and gorgeous apparrell? where are our sumptuous hangings? our rich cubboard of plate? our gold and silver? where are our orient pearles? our blushing rubies? our glowing carbuncles? our sparkling diamonds? our beautifull damsels? our pompous shewes? our various delights and pastimes? our riotous banquets? our effeminate songs? our melodious musicke? our lascivious dancing? our amorous imbracings? All these things are vanished like shadowes; but our sorrowes come upon us thicke and threefold: all our joyes, delights and comforts are withered at the root; but our terrours, hearts griefe and torments grow on us more and more, and shall till time shall be no more.Applica∣tion. If these piteous complaints and hideous shrikes of the damned in hell move us not, I tremble to speake it, they shall be one day ours: then with anguish of heart and bitternesse of soule we shall sigh and say, O that wee had been wise, then wee would have under∣stood these things, and in time considered of our later end. Our later end setteth before us quatuor novissima, the foure last things: 1. Death, most certaine. 2. Judgement, most strict. 3. Hell, most dreadfull. 4. Paradise, most delightfull. O Death, how bitter is thy remembrance to him that is in the prime of his pleasures, and pride of his fortune? yet the remembrance of judge∣ment is more bitter than of death, of hell than of judgement: death in comparison were no death, if judgement followed not after; and judge∣ment were no judgement, or nothing so dreadfull, if immediately upon it hell were not opened; and hell were not hell, if it deprived us not of the pleasures of Paradise for ever. O that men were wise to consider in the
beginning, or at least before it bee too late, what their later end shall bee; first to dye, then to bee brought to judgement, and after sentence,Applica∣tion. either to be led to the rivers of pleasure springing at the right hand of God for evermore, or to be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone with the Di∣vell and his angels, and all the reprobate and damned, theApoc. 14.11. smoake of whose torment ascendeth up for ever and ever, and they have no rest day nor night. Ashes keepe fire alive, and the consideration of our end and dissolu∣tion, which shall be into dust and ashes, not onely keepeth alive, but also stirreth up the sparkes of Gods grace in us after this manner: Why doe I thus torment my selfe with projects, cares, and designes? I shall short∣ly (I know not how soon) returne to my earth, and then all myPsal. 146.1. thoughts shall perish. Why doe I beare my head so high now? it shall lye low enough one day. Why doe I lay on so much cost on gorgeous appar∣rell, which covereth nothing but dust and dung? Why doe I prodigal∣ly lavish out my patrimony in exquisite dainties, and all kindes of delicious meates, which feed nothing but wormes? Why dote I upon the fairest beauty flesh and bloud can present to a lascivious eye? if it be artificiall, it is nothing but paint and powder; if naturall, nothing but dust and ashes. Why doe I send to the uttermost parts of the earth for the rarest stuffes, the finest linnen and napery? I shall carry nothing of it all away with mee but my winding sheet. Lastly, why doe I make so great purchases of lands and possessions? I shall keep the possession of nothing but the measure of my grave, and perhaps bee disturbed in it too, as two of the greatest purchasers of land in the world were. William the Norman, who conquered a great part of this Island, and Alex∣ander the great, who conquered the greatest part of the knowne world, both lay a long time above ground unburied, being denied that which the poorest beggar that never had foot of land in all his life hath freely given unto him, a hole to lay his head in under ground. Verily, as nothing can quench the burning slime of Samosaris calledPlin. nat. hist. l. 2. c. 104. Limum flagrantem (quam Mal∣tham vocant) tetra tantum extingui do∣cuêre experi∣menta. Flagrat mons Chimae∣ra immortali flammâ, extin∣guitur tamen terrâ & fimo. Maltha, nor the flame of the hill Chimaera, but onely earth; so nothing can extinguish the ever burning desires of the ambitious for honour, of the voluptuous for pleasure, of the covetous for gaine, but onely mold and earth, the complements of our grave, and remaines of our later end. In my discourse of our later end, to draw towards an end, before the de∣struction of the holy City and Temple, Josephus writeth of a man afflicted in minde, that ran about the City crying, Wo to the City, wo to the Temple, wo to the Priests, wo to the people, and last of all wo to my selfe; at which words he was slaine on the walls by a stone out of a sling. Let us take away but one letter, turning wo in O, and his prophesie for the future may be our admonition, and the application of this observation for the present. O that the world, O that this Kingdome in the world, O that this City in this Kingdome, O that we in this City here present were wise, then would wee understand this: this spectacle of our nature, this embleme of our frailty, this mirrour of our mortality,Applicat. ad defunct. and in it consider our later end, which cannot bee farre off. For our deceased brother is here arrested before our eyes for a debt of nature, in which wee are as deeply ingaged as hee; and if either the wealth of the world, or gifts of
nature, or jewels of grace might have redeemed him; if either skill of Physicians, or love and care of his friends, or prayers and teares of his kindred, and his dearest second selfe could have bayled him, hee had not been laid up as now you see him. But let no man sell you smoake to daz your eyes in such sort, but that you may all see your owne faces in thi broken glasse. There is no protection to bee got from King or Nobles i this case: no rescuing any by force from this Sergeant of God, death: a baile or mainprise from this common prison of all mankinde, the grave: all our comfort is, that we may hereafter sue out an habeas corpus, which the Judge of all flesh will not deny us at the generall Assizes, that we may make our corporall appearance at his barre in the clouds, and there have our cause tryed. Doe you desire to know how this debt with infinite ar∣rerages groweth upon us and all mankinde? Saint Austin giveth you a good account, the woman tooke up sinne from the Serpent, as it were by loane, consensu Adam fecit cautionem, usura crevit posteritati, Adam by consen∣ting sealed the band, the interest hath runne upon all his posterity, and the interest that death had in him by sinne, and upon us by him, and the inte∣rest upon interest by numberlesse actuall sinnes eateth us out one by one, till death that swalloweth us up all in the end be swallowed up into1 Cor. 15.15. victory: and then shall be fulfilled that prophesie, O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? At which Goale-delivery of all deaths prisoners, wee that are living shall not prevent our brother that lyeth asleep before us in his winding sheet: upon whose hearse after I have strowed a few flow∣ers, I will commit him to the earth, and you to God. 1. The first flower is a Rose, the embleme of charity. For a Rose is hot in nature, it spreadeth it selfe abroad, and after it is full blowne shattereth both leaves and seeds; so charity is hot in the affection, spreadeth it selfe abroad by compassion, and scattereth seeds by almes-deeds. Our deceased brother, like a provence or double Rose (for God doubled the blessings of this life upon him) spread himselfe abroad every way by largesse, and shed seeds plentifully, but withall so secretly, that his left hand knew not what his right hand did: his Legacies by his death were not great, be∣cause his will was in this kind to be his owne executor by his life time. 2. The second flower is the Lilly, the embleme of purity and chastity. For the Lilly is perfect white in colour, and cold in operation, and there∣by representeth pure chastity, which cooleth the heat of lust: this flower he kept unblasted in the time and place of most danger, in the prime of his youth, and in his travels beyond the sea, where hee chose his consort out of pure love; and ever loved his choice with a constant and loyall affecti∣on unto death. 3. The third flower is the Violet, the embleme of humility. For the Violet is little, as the humble is in his owne eyes, and groweth neere the ground, from whence the humble taketh his name, humilis ab humo, and of all other flowers it yeeldeth the sweetest savour, as humility doth in the nostrils of God and man. Of his humility hee gave good proofe in his lovely and lowly carriage towards all, in his refusing places of eminency, in renouncing all confidence in his owne merits at his death, and forbidding that a Trumpet should bee blowne before his workes
of piety or charity. Wherefore I must be silent of the dead by the com∣mand of the dead, with whose Christian and happy end I will conclude. I was the happinesse of Homer to bee borne in Rhodes,, rosa. , viola. a place ta∣g the name from Roses, and to bee buried in Chios taking the name m Violets: this was the happinesse of our brother, who was borne and buried in the garden of Christs Spouse, where he drew in his first, and let out his last breath in the sincere profession of the Gospel, which is the savour of life unto life: which happinesse God grant unto us all for his Son Jesus Christ his sake. To whom, &c.
THE EMBLEME OF THE CHURCH MILITANT. A Sermon preached in Mercers Chappell. THE XXIII. SERMON. APOC. 12.6. And the woman fled into the wildernesse, where shee hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand, two hundred, and threescore dayes. Right Honourable, right Worshipfull, &c. THeCaussin. parab. hist. Ceraunias in locis fulmine tactis inveni∣tur. Naturalists write of a precious stone called Cerau∣nias, that it is found only in a day of thunder, glistering when the skie is overcast with darknes. With these gems the Spouse of Christ is adorned, whose faith, constancy and patience shine most brightly in time of adversity and persecution, when all the earth is full of darknesse and cruell habitations. AsPlin. nat. hist. l. 2. In Troglo∣dytis fons solis circa meidiem maximè frigi∣dus, mox pau∣latim tepescens; ad noctis me∣dium ferven∣tissimus est. c. 103. the fountaine of the sunne in the country of the Troglodytes is cold or lukewarme at mid-day, but most extreme hot at mid-night; such is the nature of zeale: in the day of prospe∣rity, and high noone of temporall glory it is cold, or at the best luke∣warme: but in the night of adversity, and dead time of persecution it is most fervent and flagrant. Then the sincere professors open their hearts most freely in prayer to God, and their bowels of Christian charity and compassion to their afflicted brethren: the feare of their enemies husheth their private differences: their losse of goods and lands is an inducement to
them to contemne the world, and (as having little or no comfort in this life) to set their hearts wholly upon Heaven. On the contrary, peace usually breeds carnall security, abundance luxury, wealth pride, honour ambition, power oppression, pleasure sensuality, and earthly contentments worldli∣nesse the bane of Religion. In which consideration especially we may con∣ceive it is, that our blessed Lord the Husband of the Church, who loveth her more than all the world besides (which hee preserveth onely for her sake) yet seldome crowneth her in this world with worldly happinesse and eminent greatnesse; but exerciseth her now under the crosse, as hee did un∣der the bondage of Egypt; and captivity of Babylon before his comming into the flesh; and after his death, first under the fury of the Heathen, next the cruelty of the Arrian Emperours, and since that, under the insolency of the Turke in the East, and tyranny of Antichrist in the West. As hee is termed by the Prophet Esay, Vir dolorum, a man of sorrowes; so we finde her Uxorem lachrymarum, a wife of teares; as he was crowned with thorns, so she lyeth in the briars: as he was laid in wait for at his birth, so she at her new birth: as he fled from Herod into Egypt, so she from the Dragon into the wildernesse: as he was tempted once, so she is alwayes: as he bare his crosse to Golgotha, so she hath borne hers in all parts and ages of the world. Indeed sometimes she hath had lucida intervalla, times of light∣somenesse and joy, when Kings have been her nursing fathers, and Queenes her nursing mothers: but for the most part she sitteth in darknesse, as a close mourner, yet solacing her selfe withMicah 7.8. Re∣joyce not against mee, O my enemy: When I fall I shall rise, when I sit in darknesse the Lord shall be light unto mee. hope of better times. Hence it is, that all the pictures that are drawne of her in Scripture, are either taken from aApoc. 12.13. child-bearing woman frighted by a Dragon gaping to devoure her babe, or aLament. 1.1. widow making lamentation for her husband, or a motherMatth. 2.18. weeping for her children, or aPsal. 39.12. pilgrime passing from country to country, or an her∣mite lodged in the wildernesse, as here in my Text. The Saints of God are described in holy Scripture clad in three sutes of apparrell different in co∣lour: 1. Blacke. 2. Red. 3. White. Blacke is their mourning weed. Red their military ornament. White their wedding garment. They mourne in blacke for their sinnes and grievous afflictions: They fight in red against their bloudy persecutours: They triumph and sit at the marriage feast of theApoc. 16.11. And white robes were given to every one of them. Lambe in white. Two of their sutes they are well knowne by on earth, the third is reserved in Gods Wardrob, and shall be given them in Heaven. The two former may be called their working day apparrell, but the last their Holy-day or Sunday. For they weare it not but upon their everlasting Sabbath in Heaven. Their red and blacke vests doe not so much cover their bodies, as discover their state and condition in this world; where they alwayes either stand, and fight with their bodily and ghostly enemies, or sit downe andJob 7.1. weep for their irrecoverable losses
and incurable wounds. Their life is aJob 7.1. continuall warfare upon earth; three potent enemies continually bid them battell: 1 The World, Without. 2 The Flesh, Within. 3 The Divell, Both within and without. The Divell never ceaseth to suggest wicked thoughts, the World to pre∣sent dangerous baites, the Flesh to ingender noysome lusts. The Divell mainly assaulteth their faith, the World their hope, the Flesh their love: and they fight with three speciall weapons; 1 Temptations. 2 Heresies. 3 Persecutions. Temptations I call all vitious provocations: heresies, all false doctrines in matter of faith and salvation: persecutions all outward afflictions. Temp∣tations properly lay at the will, heresies at the understanding, persecutions at the whole person: which though the Church of Christ for the most part in her noble members couragiously endureth, and therefore is fitly compared to the Pyrausts, which are nourished in the fire; and to the Phoe∣nix, because she riseth againe out of the ashes of the burnt bodies of Mar∣tyrs: yet sometimes, especially in her weake and more feeble members, to escape this fire she flies into some wildernesse, or remote or obscure place, where God alwayes provideth for her. Division.And the woman, there is the frailtie of her nature; fled, there is the uncer∣tainty of her state; into the wildernesse, there is the place of her retirednesse; where she is nourished by God, there is the staffe of her comfort; a thousand two hundred and threescore dayes, there is the terme of her obscuritie, and the period of all her troubles. And the woman, &c. Though all the prophecies of this booke are dark∣ned with much obscurity, yet by illustrating the vision set downe through this whole chapter, and hanging it, as it were a great light, in the most emi∣nent part of it, we shall easily discover what divine truth lyeth hid in eve∣ry corner thereof. The holy Apostle, and the Evangelist S. John, in a di∣vine rapture saw a most faire and glorious woman in travell, and an ugly red Dragon with seven heads and ten hornes, standing before her with o∣pen mouth, ready to devoure her child; of which she was no sooner deli∣vered, but her son was taken up to the Throne of God, and she carried with the wings of an Eagle into the Wildernesse: the Dragon thus deceived of his prey, after which his mouth watered, cast out of his mouth water as a floud after her to drowne her. Such was the vision; marke now, I beseech you, the interpretation thereof. By the woman all that have dived deepe into the profound mysteries of this booke understand the Church, whose beautie and glory isVer. 1. There appeared a great wonder in hea∣ven, a woman cloathed with the Sunne, and the Moone under her feet: and upon her head a crowne of twelve starres. illustrated by the Sunne cloathing her, and the Moone supporting her, and the Starres crowning her. The Sunne either signifieth the knowledge of Gods Word, which enlighteneth the Church through∣out;
or Christ the Sunne of righteousnesse, who cloathes her with the robes of his righteousnesse,Mal. 4 2. and exalteth her to his throne of glory above the Moone, on which she standeth; and thereby sheweth her contempt of this uncertaine and mutable world, ruled by the Moone, and subject to as many changes as that planet. Thus it seemeth cleere what is meant by the Sunne and Moone; but what shall we make of the crowne of twelve starres set upon her head? It seemeth to represent either the number of the twelve Patriarkes the Crowne of the Jewish, or the twelve Apostles the Crown of the Christian Church. The man child which this woman had no sooner brought forth, but he was caught up unto God in his Throne,Ver. 5. and was to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, is undoubtedly our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; as by comparing the fift verse of this chapter with Psal. 2. v. 9. and Apoc. 2.27. and 19.15. appeareth most evidently. As for the Dragon, he is so set out in his colours, v. 9. that any may know him: there he is called the old Serpent, the Divell and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world. The wa∣ters which he casteth out of his mouth, are multitudes of people which he stirreth up to persecute the Church. He is described with seven heads and ten hornes, like to the woman, whereby the Roman Empire or Church is meant, called Babylon, the Mother of fornications, and abominations on the earth, ver. 5. because the Dragon employed the seven heads, and ten hornes,Apoc. 17, 3.5. that is, the policie and strength of the Roman State especially, to suppresse the true Religion, and overthrow the Church. Other Kingdomes and States have beene stained with the bloud of Christians, but Rome is that Whore of Babylon, which hath died her garments scarlet red with the bloud of Saints and Martyrs of Jesus Christ: others have licked or tasted thereof, but she, in regard of her barbarous crueltie in this kind, is said to beApoc. 17.6. drunke with their bloud. The vision thus cleared, the meaning of my text, and the speciall points of observation in each word therein may easily be discerned. The first , the woman figureth unto us the Church her 1 Originall. 2 Fruitfulnesse. 3 Tendernesse. 4 Weakenesse. 5 Frailtie. 1 First her Originall. As the first Adam being cast into a slumber, the woman was formed of a rib taken out of his side; so when the second Adam fell into a dead sleepe on the Crosse, his side was opened, and thence issued this woman here in my text, Christs dearest Spouse. 2 Her fruitfulnesse. The honour of women is their childbearing. For therefore was Heva called the mother of the living, because all save Adam came from her: such is the Church, a most indulgent and fruitfull mother; Heva mater viventium, the mother of all that live by faith. And as St.Cypr de unit. Eccles. Deum non habet pa∣trem, qui eccle∣siam non habet matrem. Cy∣prian concluded against all the Schismatikes in his time, we may resolve a∣gainst all the Separatists in our daies; they cannot have God to their Father, who acknowledge not the Church for their Mother.
3 Her tendernesse. Mulier, saith Varro, quasi mollior, women take their name in latine from tendernesse or softnesse, because they are usually of a softer temper than men, and much more subject to passions, especially of feare, griefe, love, and longing: their feare is almost perpetuall, their griefe immoderate, their love ardent, and their longing most vehement: such is the temper of the militant Church, in feare alwayes, weeping continually for her children, never out of trouble in one place or other, sicke for love of her husband Christ Jesus, and ever longing for his second comming. 4 Her weakenesse or impotencie. Women are the weaker1 Pet. 3.7. Gi∣ving honour to the wife as to the weaker vessell. vessels, they have no strength in comparison of men; they are able to make small or no resistance: and in this also the militant Church resembleth a woman; for howsoever she be alwayes strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, and albeit for a short time, when she had Kings and Princes for her Champions, as in the daies of David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Josiah, and other Kings of Judah: and in the reigne of Constantine, Theodosius, Martianus, Ju∣stinian, and other Emperours of Rome, by the temporall sword she put her e∣nemies to the worst, and had a great hand over them: yet in other ages, as well before Christs incarnation as after, she hath bin destitute of the arm of flesh, and hath had no other than womens weapons to defend her self, viz. prayers and teares. These alone St. Ambrose tooke up for his defence against the Arrian Emperour;Amb. ep. 33. R gamus Au∣guste, non pug∣namus. We bow downe before thee, we rise not up against thee, our dread Lord. For my owne part I can sorrow, I can sigh, I can weepe; by other meanes I neither may nor can resist. 5 Her frailtie. Women are not only weaker in body than men, and lesse able to resist violence; but also weaker in mind, and lesse able to hold out in temptations: and therefore the Divell first set upon the woman, as conceiving it a matter of more facilitie to supplant her than the man. I would the militant Church were not in this also too like the weaker sexe. Faire she is I grant, butCant. 6.10. faire as the Moone, in which there are darke and blacke spots:Origen in Cant. hom an illa ver∣ba Niga s. Nigra est spon∣sa, pulchra ta∣men inter muli∣cres ita ut ha¦beat aliquid Ae∣thiopici can∣doris. Or, as St. Origen noteth, pulchra inter mulieres, not perfectly faire, but faire among women: her brightest colours are somewhat stained, her graces clouded, her beauty Sun-burnt. Let the Pelagians and Papists stand never so much upon the perfection of inherent righteousnesse, they shall never be able to wash cleane theEsay 64 6. We are all as an un∣cleane thing, and all our righteous∣nesse is as filthy ragges. menstruous cloutes, and filthy ragges the Prophet Esay speaketh of. St. Austin, who was more inward to the servants of God in his time, and better acquainted with their thoughts than any Heretikes could be, telleth us, that if all the Saints from the beginning of the world were together upon earth, and should joyne in one prayer, it would be this or the like, Lord enter not into judgement with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. Nothing is so easie as to slip whilest wee walke upon aApoc 15 2. And I saw as it wre aea of glasse min∣gled with fire. sea of glasse. For this reason it is that our Saviour teacheth us to pray,Mat. 6.13. lead us not into temptation; because there is not any temptation so weake, that putteth not our frailtie to the worse: and albeit it overcome not our faith, yet it maketh our sinewes so shrinke (as Jacobs did after hee wrestled with the Angell) that by it we are lamed in holy duties. All those usuall similitudes whereby the Scripture setteth the Church militant be∣fore our eyes, shew her frailtie and imbecilitie. She is a vine, a lilly, a dove, a flocke of sheepe in the midst of ravening wolves. What tree so subject to
take hurt as a vine, which is so weake, that it needeth continuall binding and supporting; so tender, that if it be prickt deepe, it bleedeth to death? No flower so soft and without all defence or shelter as a lilly; no fowle so harm∣lesse as the dove that hath no gallat all; no cattell so oft in danger as sheep and lambes in the midst of wolves. Yet neither the weake vine, nor the soft lilly, nor the fearefull dove, nor the harmelesse sheepe, so lively expres∣seth the infirmitie and danger of the wayfaring or rather warfaring Church, as the travelling woman in this vision. What more pitifull object or la∣mentable spectacle can present it selfe to our eyes, than a woman great with child, scared with a fierie serpent ready to devoure her child, and driven to fly away with her heavie burden with which she is scarce able to wag? This and worse, if worse may be, is the case of Christs Spouse, the true Inheri∣trix of his Crosse, which he bequeathed her at his death, having indeed little else to leave her: for his soule he was to surrender to God his Father, his body Joseph of Arimathea begged of Pilat, his cloathes the souldiers par∣ted among them; onely his crosse, and nailes, and crowne of thornes remai∣ned to dispose of for his dearest Spouse; which she continually beareth a∣bout with her, and in this vision carried with her into the wildernesse, whi∣ther she fled to save her life. And the woman Fled. This picture might have beene taken of the Church as she fled from Pharaoh into the wildernesse; or as she fled into Egypt from Herod; or as she fled into all parts of the earth in the time of the ten first persecuti∣ons from heathen Emperors; or in the succeeding ages from the Arrian Em∣perours; and last of all from Antichrist and his instruments: in all which her trialls and troubles she gained more than she lost. For as Justine Martyr rightly observed,Just. apolog. Id est persecutio Ecclesiae, quod vineae putatio. persecution is that to the Church which pruning is to the vine, whereby it is made more fruitfull: with whom Tertullian accordeth, thus jearing at the Gentiles, who made full account by their barbarous cruelty to exhaust the whole Church, and extinguish the name of Christians:Tert. apolog c. ult. Nequic∣quam tamen proficit exquisi∣ta quae{que} cru∣delitas vestra, illecebra est magis sectae: plures esficimur quoties meti∣mur a vobis: semen est san∣guis Christia∣norum. What gaine you by your exquisite crueltie and studied torments which you inflict up∣on us? they are no scarre-crowes to fright, but rather baites and lures to draw men to our profession: we ever grow faster and thicker after we are mowed by you: the shedding the bloud of Christians is the sowing the seed of the Gospell. And St. Leo;I eoserm. 1. in nat. Petri & Pau∣li. Non minu∣itur persecutio∣nibus Ecclesia Dei, sed augetur magis: ager Dominicus se∣gete ditiore ve∣stitur, dum gra∣na quae singula cadunt multi∣plicata nascun∣tur. The Church of God is not diminished by persecutions, but in∣creased rather; the Lords field is cloathed with a richer crop whilest the seed or graines which fall one by one, after they are dead in the earth rise up againe in great numbers. Moreover, whilest in the chief Cities those who are called by God to depose for his truth win many thousands to the Christian faith, other servants of Christ, to whom he hath vouchsafed meanes to escape, by dispersing themselves into all parts of the world, propagate the doctrine of the Gospell, and plant new Churches. Upon this flight of the woman in my text, many of the learned Interpreters take occasion to handle that great case of conscience, whether it be lawfull to fly in time of persecution, or whether all zealous Christians are not bound to stand to their tackling, and strive for the truth, even to the effusion of their bloud.Aug. l. 22. de civ. Dei c. 7. Pul∣lulatura foecun∣ditis cum in san∣guine Marty∣um seretur. Tert. infug. in erscut. Tertullian in his booke professedly written of this subject is altogether against flight, grounding his judgement upon the words of our Saviour, John 10.11. &c. I am the good shepheard: the good shepheard giveth his life for the sheepe.
But he that is an hireling, and not the shepheard, whose owne the sheep are not, seeth the Wolfe comming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: the hireling flyeth, because he is an hireling, &c. And Marke 8.35, 38. Whosoever will save his life shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the Gospels, the same shall save it. Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of mee, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinfull generation, of him also shall the sonne of man be ashamed, when he commeth in the glory of his Father with the holy Angels. But Saint Austin and others allow of flight in some case, and they bring very good warrant for it, Christs expresse command, Matth. 10.23. When they persecute you in this city, flee into another. And Matth. 24.15, 16. When you see the abomination of desolation stand in the holy place, then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountaines. And to the end we should count it no shame to flye in this case, they bring noble presidents for it, and shew us the footsteps in Scripture of Jacob when he fled from Esau: and Moses, when hee fled from Pharaoh: and Eliah, when hee fled from Ahab and Jezabel: and David, when hee fled from Saul: and Joseph and Mary when they fled from Herod. They adde also, that by this flight of many in time of persecution the Church reapeth a double benefit: first, hereby many worthy Doctors and eminent Pro∣fessours reserve themselves for better times: next, they in their flight scat∣ter the seeds of the Gospel, whereby the great Husbandman gathereth a plentifull crop. If the Apostles had not been scattered by the persecution of Herod, and the primitive Christians by the persecutions of the Hea∣then Emperours, and the true Professours in later times by the persecuti∣on of Antichrist, many countries in all likelihood had not been sowen with the pure seed of the Word. The resolution of this question may be taken from my Text: in such a case as the womans was here we may flie; that is, when there is no safety in staying, and God offereth us Eagles wings, that is, a faire and certaine meanes to escape danger. Yea, but Chri∣stian courage will rise up against this, and object, Is not Martyrdome a garland of red Roses? is not the bloud of Saints the best watering of Gods field? can wee shew more love to Christ than to signe the Gospell with our bloud? will you perswade Christian souldiers to flye from their co∣lours, nay from their crowne? God forbid. I answer, all are not appoin∣ted by God to bee Martyrs, nor qualified for so noble and eminent ser∣vice. To a Martyr two things are required: 1. A speciall calling. 2. An extraordinary spirit. Even in our Courts of justice a witnes that offereth himself is not accepted, he must be brought in by order of law: neither will Christ have any depose for him that are not called to it, & whom he calleth, he endueth them with an heroicke spirit, and armeth them with faith and patience like armour of proofe, into which the fiery darts of the wicked cannot enter. Every sin∣cere beleever hath not a spirit of fortitude given him to conquer the vio∣lence of fire, and dull the edge of the sharpest swords, and weary all tor∣tures and torments. Moreover, God like a provident Husbandman, though
he send much corne to the Mill to be ground, as Ignatius and others, that they might be served in as fine manchet at his owne table: yet he reserveth alwayes some corne for seed, I meane some pastours and eminent profes∣sours to sow his field in future times, and propagate Religion to poste∣rity. These may and ought to flie in time of persecution: provided first that they flie not when their conscience perswadeth them that their flight will be a great scandall to Religion, and a discouragement to the weaker; and they feele in themselves a great and earnest desire to glorifie God by stri∣ving for his truth unto bloud. For being thus called by God, and enabled and encouraged, they must preferre Gods glory before their life, and a crowne of martyrdome before any earthly condition. 2. That they leave not the Church destitute. For Christ giveth it for one of the characters of an hireling, toJohn 10.13. flie when hee seeth the Wolfe com∣ming, and looke to his owne safety, taking little care what becommeth of his flocke. 3. They must not use any indirect meanes to flye, they may not betray Gods truth or their brethren to save their owne life: he that saveth his life upon such termes shall lose it, and he that loseth his life in Gods cause shall finde it. You will say peradventure, how may this be? I answer, as that which is lost in Alpheus, after a certaine time is undoubtedly found againe in Arethusa: so that which is lost on earth shall be found in Heaven. Hee that loseth his life for Christs sake in this vale of teares, shall finde it at the last day in thePsal. 16.11. river of pleasures, springing at the right hand of God for e∣vermore. When the Starres set here, they rise in the other hemisphere; so when Confessours and Martyrs set here, they rise in heaven, and shall ne∣ver set againe. Therefore as Christ spake of Virginity, wee may say of Martyrdome: what he spake of the garland of white roses, we may of the garland of red; Qui potest capere, capiat; Hee that is able to receive it, let him receive it; he that is not able, let him trace the footsteps of the woman here that fled Into the wildernesse. Not by change of place, saithIn Apoc. c. 12. Fugit non mu∣tatione loci, sed amissione sta∣tus & ornatus. Pareus, but change of state and condition. I see no reason of such a restraint; the Church may, and sometimes doth flye two manner of wayes: 1. Openly, when being persecuted in one country, shee posteth into an∣other. 2. Secretly, when shee abideth where shee was, but keepeth her selfe close, and shunneth the eye of the world, and worshippeth God in secret, mourning for the abominations and publike prophanations of true Reli∣gion. Thus then wee may expound the words, the woman fled into the wildernesse, that is, she withdrew her selfe from publike view, kept her exercises of Religion in private, held her meetings in cryptis (hidden pla∣ces) as vaults under ground,Heb. 11 38. They wandred in deserts & moun∣taines, and dens and caves of the earth. dens and caves in the earth: or if persecution raged above measure, and without end, removed from country to country, and from city to wildernesse for safety. By wildernesse, some learned Ex∣positors understand remote countries, inhabited by Paynims and Gentiles, where yet the fire of persecution is not kindled. For, say they, though such places be never so well peopled, yet they may be termed deserts; because never manured by Gods husbandry, never sown with the seed of the Word,
never set with plants of Paradise, never watered with the dew of heavenly grace. And if the Church had not removed into such wildernesses, she had never visited us in England, severed after a sort from the whole world. Toto divisos Orbe Britannos. But such hath beene Gods goodnesse to these Ilands, that the woman in my text was carried with herVer. 14. And to the woman was given two wings of a great Eagle. Eagles wings into these parts, before the Roman Eagles were brought in here: our Countrey submitted it selfe to the Crosse of Christ before it stooped to the Roman scepter. Howbeit, I take not this to be the meaning of this Scripture. For the propagation of the Church, and the extending her bounds to the remotest regions of the world, maketh her catholike, and by it she becommeth glorious: where∣as the Spirit speaketh here of her as in some eclipse. The wildernesse there∣fore here meant, must needes be some obscure place or region, to which she fled to hide her selfe. If you demand particularly when this prophecy was fulfilled; I answer, partly in those Hebrewes of whom St. Paul writeth, that they lay in wildernesses, and dennes, and caves of the earth: partly in those Disciples that were in Jerusalem in the time of the siege, and a little before, who mindfull of our Saviours commandement fled into the moun∣taines, and were miraculously preserved in Pella, as Eusebius writeth: part∣ly in those Christians, who in the dayes of Maximinus and Dioclesian fled so farre that they never returned backe againe into any City, but were the fathers of them that live in woods and desarts, as Hermites; or inclosed within foure walls, as Recluses and Anchorites: partly in those Orthodoxe beleevers, who in the reigne of the Arrian Emperours tooke desarts and caves under ground for sanctuary; of whom St. Hilarie writeth saying,L. adver. Aux∣ent. Ecclesia potius delituit in cavernis, quam in prima∣riis Urbibus e∣minebat. The Church rather lurked in holes and vaults under ground in those dayes, than shewed her selfe openly in the chiefe Cities: partly in those professours of the Gospell, who ever since the man of sinne was revealed, have beene by him put to great streights, and driven to lie hid for many yeeres in soli∣tary and obscure places: in all which persecutions of the Church, God prepared for her not only a place to lodge in, but a table also that they should Feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore dayes. Some refer∣ring this prophesie to the Jewes abode in Pella, find the time to be precisely three yeeres and an halfe: others by dayes understanding yeeres, rec∣kon from the declining age of Constantine, till the great reformation in our age, neere upon a thousand two hundred and threescore yeeres: in all which time the true Church hath played least in sight, and beene in a maner buried in oblivion. But neither is this calculation exact, neither (as I con∣ceive) doth St. John speake of one flight onely, nor of any particular place, nor definite number of yeeres; but after the manner of Prophets putteth a definite number for an indefinite, and foresheweth that the true Church must for a long time lie hid, and withdraw her selfe out of the worlds eye, as it is afterwards exprest, a time, times, and halfe a time: a time under the heathen Emperours, times under severall Heretikes, and last of all, halfe a time in that last and greatest tribulation immediately before the utter over∣throw
of Antichrist. For thatMat. 24.22. persecution shall be shortened, as our Saviour intimateth, for the Elects sake, lest all flesh should perish. You have here (as before I shewed you) the Church of Christ drawne as it were with a coale, and expressed with three darke and sad markes: 1 Frailty: A woman. 2 Perplexity: Fled. 3 Obscurity: To the wildernesse. Her nature is frailtie: The woman. Her state is uncertainty: Fled. Her glory obscurity: remained in the wildernesse a thousand two hundred and threescore dayes. From the frailty of her nature let us learne a lecture of sober watch∣fulnesse; from the unsettlednesse of her estate, a lecture of prudent mo∣deration; from her obscurity or latencie, a lecture of modest humi∣litie. 1 If the mother be fraile, the daughter is like to be weake. They who are subject to slip and fall must carefully avoyd high and narrow ridges, as also slippery places, and precipices or downefalls. We scarce standSeneca de ira. Recedamus quantum possu∣mus à lubrico, vix in sicco fir∣miter stamus. sure upon drie, firme, and plaine ground; therefore let us beware with all dili∣gence how we come nigh high ridges with the ambitious, or slipperie pla∣ces with the voluptuous, or downefalls with the presumptuous sinner: let us pray to God 1 To make his way plaine before us. 2 To order our steps in the plaine path. 3 To support us continually with his right hand. 2 If the Spouse of Christ be a pilgrime, and flieth from place to place, from Citie to Citie, from Kingdome to Kingdome; let us learne by her example, and from the Apostle's mouth, thatHeb. 13.14. we have here no continuing Citie, but seeke one to come. St. James by an elegant metaphor calleth the affaires of this worldJam 3.6. . , the course of nature, a nowne derived from a verbe signifying to runne; because the world runneth upon wheeles. As in triumphes and pompous shewes we see towers, and rockes, and castles, but enpassant, carried in procession, not staying any where: such is the glory of this world. The portable Arke in the Old Testament, and the flying wo∣man in the New, are images of the militant Church in this world; the one was drawne by beasts from place to place, the other was carried with the wings of an Eagle from Country to Country: neither of them was fixed. When two Noble men strived about a fish pond, and could by no meanes be brought to an agreement, Gregorius Thaumaturgus by miracle suddenly dried it up: so God in wisedome taketh away from us the things of this life, if we too much strive for them. Wherefore let us not build upon the sailes of a wind-mill, let us not cast the anchor of our hope on the earth, for there is nothing to hold by: riches get themselves wings, possessions change
their Lords, great houses, according to Diogenes his apophthegme, vomit and cast up their owners. The favours of men are like vanes on the top of houses and steeples, which turne with the wind. The Church in many re∣spects is compared to the moone, she receiveth her light from the Sun of righteousnesse, she hath her waxing and waining, is never without spots, is often eclipsed by the interposition of the shadow of the earth, I meane the shadowes of earthly vanities. Those who professe the art of turning baser metals into gold, first begin with abstractio terrestrietatis à materia, the ab∣straction or drawing away of earthlinesse from the matter of their metall: in like manner, if we desire to be turned as it were into fine gold, and serve as vessels of honour in God house, our earthly dregs and drosse must be drawne out of us by the fire of the Spirit; that is, our earthly cares, our earthly desires, our earthly hopes, our earthly affections. Hercules could never conquer Anteus, donec à terra matre eum levasset, till hee had lifted him up above the earth his mother: no more can the Spirit of grace subdue and conquer us to the obedience of the Gospel, till hee hath lifted up our hearts from the earth with these levers, especially the considera∣tion of 1 The vanity of earthly delights. 2 The verity of heavenly comforts. 3 The excellency of our soule. 4 The high price of our redemption. Can we imagine that so incomparable a jewell as is the soule of man was made to be set as it were in a ring on a swines snout, to dig and root in the earth? Did God breathe into us spirit and life, nay, did Christ breathe out his immortall spirit for this end, to purchase us the happinesse of a mucke-worme, that breedeth and feedeth, liveth and dyeth in the dung? or at the best the happinesse of an IndianChrysost. hom. 7. in ep. ad Philipp. . Emmet, that glistereth with gold dust about her? St. Austin hath long agoe christened the con∣tentments of this world in the font of teares, by the names of solacia mise∣rorum, non gaudia beatorum; solaces of wretched, not joyes of blessed ones: at the best they are but reliefes of naturall necessities. For what is wealth but the reliefe of want? food, but the reliefe of hunger? cloathing, but the reliefe of nakednesse? sleepe, but the reliefe of watching? company, but the reliefe of solitarinesse? sports and pastimes, but the taking off the plaister, and giving our wounds a little aire, and our selves a little ease from our continuall labour and paines? Like the gnats in Plutarch we run con∣tinually round in the circle of our businesse till we fall downe dead, traver∣sing the same thoughts, and repeating the same actions perpetually; and what happinesse can be in this? The more we gild over the vanities of this world with the title of honours, pleasures and riches, the more we make them like the golden apples which hung at Tantalus his lips, which were snatched away from him when he offered to bite at them. For the1 John 2.17. world passeth away, and the lust thereof. Albeit the earth abideth, and shall till the end of the world, which cannot be now farre off; yet all Monarchs, Kingdomes, States, Common-wealthes, Families, Houses, passe. There
is written upon them what Balthasar saw, the hand writing upon the walls of his Palace, Mene, mene, tekel upharsin. Admit they abide for a large time, yet we are removed from them by persecution, invasion, pere∣grination, ejection, and death. Albeit our Lawyers speake of indefeisable e∣states, and large termes of yeeres to have and to hold lands on earth, yet they speake without booke; for no man can have a better estate than the rich man in the Gospell, to whom it was said,Luke 12.20. Thou foole, this night thy soule shall be required of thee, and then whose shall those things be which thou hast prouided? so is he that layeth up treasure for himselfe, and is not rich to∣wards God. Wherefore if ever we looke to arrive at the faire haven, we must cast anchor in heaven, and not trust in uncertaine riches, but in the living God: who here provided for the woman both a lodging and a table in the wildernesse. Wherefore let us cast the burthen of our care upon the provi∣dence of our heavenly Father, who feedeth the young ravens that call upon him, and undoubtedly will never suffer his children to starve. There is nothing more choaketh the seed of faith, and dampeth the light of the spirit, and troubleth the peace of conscience than worldly cares, especially when they are immoderate, inordinate, and distrustfull: immoderate in the mea∣sure, inordinate in the meanes, and distrustfull in the cause: when we say in our hearts, What shall we eate, and what shall we drinke, or wherewithall shall we be cloathed? We have but a little oyle in our cruse, and a little meale in our pot; and when that is spent what shall become of us? The cure of these worldly cares is threefold, by 1 Diversion. 2 Devotion. 3 Deposition of them. 1 By diversion, when we withdraw our mind from these carking cares and vexing thoughts, to other more pleasant cogitations of Gods former mercies to us, and the present blessings we enjoy. As Painters, when their eyes be dazled through long poring upon over-bright objects, recover them againe by looking upon greene glasse, or some darker colours, which congregate radios visuales, the sight beames: or as husbandmen, when their ground is overflown with much water, make ditches and water furrowes to carry it away; so if our mindes be overflowne with the cares of this world, there is no better meanes to draine them, than by making another passage for them, and diverting them to the contemplation of a better subject, as David did his:Psal. 119.23.24. Princes did sit and speake against mee: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes. Thy Testimonies are my delight and Coun∣sellors. 2 By devotion and prayer to Almighty God, as Hanna did: 1 Sam. 1.15. I am a wo∣man of a sorrowfull heart: I have drunke neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soule before the Lord. Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and griefe have I spoken hitherto. Then Eli answered, and said, Goe in peace; and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. And shee said, Let thine handmaid finde grace in thy sight: So the woman went her
way, and did eate, and her countenance was no more sad. 3 By deposition, when being at a stand in our deliberations, and having used all meanes to little purpose to relieve our necessities, we in the end lay downe our burthen of cares, and wholly rely upon Gods promises.Psal. 37.3, 5. Trust in the Lord and doe good, and verily thou shalt be fed. Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in him, and hee shall bring it to passe. And,Psal. 34.9.10. O feare the Lord yee his Saints, for there is no want to them that feare him. And, (Heb. 13.5. I will never leave thee nor forsake thee:)1 Pet. 5.7. Casting all our care upon him who ca∣reth for us; assuring our selves, that he who prepared Zoar to save Lot in the burning of Sodome, and Goshen to preserve the Israelites from the plagues of Egypt, and Pella to rescue his Disciples in the siege of Jerusalem; hee who provided a fountaine of water to refresh Hagar in extremity of thirst, and a cake of dough to satisfie Elias in extremity of hunger, and the shadow of a gourd to coole Jonas in extremity of heat, and an Angell from heaven to comfort our Saviour in the extremity of his agony, will never leave us utterly destitute in our greatest perplexities. The woman in my text was faine to fly into the wildernesse, from savage men to savage beasts, unpro∣vided of a place to lie in, or any manner of food to sustaine life; yet God on the sudden prepared for her both lodging and diet. So did he for the Israe∣lites, brought to a like exigent:Psal. 107.4.5.6. They wandered in the wildernesse in a soli∣tary way, they found no Citie to dwell in: hungry and thirsty; their soules fain∣ted in them: then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and hee delivered them out of their distresse.Mat. 6.32. Take no thought therefore, saith our Saviour, for your life, what you shall eate, and what you shall drinke, or wherewithall you shall be cloathed: for your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of all these things. He that cloatheth the lillies, and feedeth the fowles of heaven, will he leave his children unprovided of things necessary? No, if ordinary meanes faile, he will lay an unusuall imposition upon all creatures to relieve his chosen. The aire shall serve-in Manna for corne, the hard rocke shall gush out with streames of water, the dry cruse shall spring with oyle, the Lions jawes shall drop with hony, the fowles of heaven shall bring in meat in their bills, and the fish of the sea bring money in their mouthes to supply their severall wants, and defray their necessary charges. Therefore trouble not your selves overmuch with the cares of this life, but when you have done your utmost endevours, ease your selves by relying upon Gods providence; and be confident, that he who feedeth you with the bread of life, will not faile to give you your daily bread; hee that offereth you the cup of salvation full of the price of your redemption, and the grace of sancti∣fication, will not suffer you to die for thirst; he that cloatheth your soules with the robes of his righteousnesse, and deckes them with the jewels of his grace, will undoubtedly provide a covering for your bodies. 3 If the Church be truely represented by a woman flying into the wil∣dernesse, and there continuing for a long season, certainely outward pomp, and temporall felicity, and perpetuall visibility, are no certaine notes of her, but rather of the malignant Church. For so is the Whore of Babylon described:Apoc. 17.3.4. A woman set upon a scarlet coloured beast, arrayed in purple, decked with gold, and pretious stones, and pearles, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations. And ver. 15. The waters which thou sawest where
the whore sitteth, are peoples, and nations, and multitudes, and tongues. The darke foyle setteth off the Diamond, and the Church when she is most obscure outwardly is most glorious within. Albeit temporall felicity gi∣veth her some lustre, and furnisheth her with meanes to encourage Prose∣lytes, and erect stately monuments of piety and charity; yet withall it mi∣nistreth matter of luxury and pride, it breedeth faction and schisme, it with∣draweth the mind from celestiall contemplation, it abateth her longing de∣sire after the second comming of Christ: on the contrary, the Crosse is like a file that brighteneth all her spirituall graces, quickeneth her zeale, putteth her noblest vertues to the test; wisedome by dangers, faith by con∣flicts, courage by terrours, patience by torments, and perseverance by per∣petuall assaults. Witnesse the prime age wherein she warmed her zeale at the embers of the Martyrs sepulchres, when she had no Churches but caves under ground, no wealth but grace, no exercises but sufferings, no crowne but of martyrdome: yet then she thrived best, then she spread farthest, then she kept her purity in doctrine and conversation, then she convinced the Jewes, then she converted the Gentiles, then shee subdued Kingdomes: whence I inferre three corollaries; 1 That the Roman Church cannot be the true Church of Christ. For the true Church of Christ, as she is described in the holy Scriptures, hath for long time lien hid, beene often obscured and eclipsed by bloudy persecuti∣ons: but the Roman or Papall Church hath never beene so; her advocates plead for her, that she hath beene alwayes not onely visible, but conspicu∣ous; not onely knowne, but notorious. And among the many plausible arguments of perswasion, and deceiveable shewes of reason, wherewith they amuse and abuse the world, none prevaileth so much with the common sort and unskilfull multitude, as the outward pomp and glory of the Papall See. For sith most men are led by sense, and judge according to outward ap∣pearance, the Church of Rome, which maketh so goodly a shew, and hath born so great sway in the world for many ages, easily induceth them to be∣leeve that she is that City whereof the Prophet speaks:Psal. 87.3. Glorious things are spoken of thee thou City of God. What more glorious and glittering to the eie than the Popes triple crowne, and the Cardinals hats, and their Archbi∣shops Palls, and their Bishops miters and crozures, their shining images, their beautifull pictures, their rich hangings, their gilt rood lofts, their crosses and reliques covered in gold, and beset with all sorts of pretious stones? These with their brightnesse and resplendency dazle the eyes of the multitude: and verily if the Queenes daughters glory were all without, and the kingdome of Christ of this world, and his Church triumphant upon earth; all the knowne Churches in the Christian world must give place to the See of Rome, which hath borne up her head, when theirs have beene under water; hath sate as Queene, when they have kneeled as captives; hath braved it in purple, when they have mourned in sackcloth and ashes. But beloved,Rom. 10 17. faith commeth not by sight, but by hearing; and we are not to search the Church in the map of the world, but in the Scriptures of God; where we find her a pilgrim in Genesis, a bondwoman in Exodus, a prisoner in Judges, a captive in the book of Kings, a widow in the Prophets, and here in my text a woman labouring with child, flying from a red Dragon into the
wildernesse. I grant that Christ promiseth her a kingdome, but not of this world; and peace, but it is the peace of God; and joy, but it is in the Holy Ghost; and great glory, but it is within:Psal. 45.13. The Kings daughter is all glo∣rious within, &c. 2 That none ought to despise the Churches beyond the seas under the Crosse, but, according to the command of the blessed Apostle,Heb. 13.3. Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them that suffer adversitie, as heing our selves also in the body. Their turne of sorrow is now, ours may be hereafter: God hath begun to them in a cup of trembling, it is to be feared it will not passe us, but we and all the reformed Churches shall drink of it. Our Church in Queene Maries dayes resembled this woman in my text, theirs now doth: both never a whit the lesse, but rather the more the true Churches of Christ, because they weare his red livery, and beare his Crosse. 3 That we ought not to looke for great things in this world, but having food and raiment, as the woman had here in my text, to be therewith conten∣ted: and as she withdrew her self from the eye of the world, so ought we to retire our selves into our closets, there to have private conference with God, to examine our spirituall estate, to make up the breaches in our conscience, to poure out our soules in teares of compunction for our sins, of com∣passion for the calamities of our brethren, of an ardent desire and longing affection for the second comming of our Lord, when he shall put an end, as to all sinne and temptation, so to all sorrow and feare. Amen. Even so come Lord Jesu. To whom, &c.
THE SAINTS VEST. A Sermon preached on All-Saints day at Lin∣colnes-Inne for Doctor Preston. THE XXIV. SERMON. APOC. 7.14. These are they that came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the bloud of the Lambe. Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. THe question which the Elder moved to Saint John in the precedent verse to my Text, ; what are these? mee thinks I heare some put to mee at this present, say∣ing, What are these holy ones whose feast yee keep? what meane these devotions? what doe these festivities intend? what speake these solemnities? what Saints are they, Virgins, Confessours, or Martyrs, whose memory by the anniversary returne of this day you eternize? ; whence came they? or rather how came they to bee thus honoured and canoni∣zed in our Kalendar? My direct answer hereunto is my Text (These are they, &c.) and the exemplification thereof shall be my Sermon. The palmes they beare are ensignes of their victory: the robes they weare are emblemes of their glory: the bloud wherein they dyed their robes representeth the ob∣ject of their faith: the white and bright colour of them, their joy: and the length of them the continuance thereof. Yea but these holy ones (you may object) at least the chiefe of them had their dayes apart; the blessed Vir∣gin hers apart, and the Innocents apart, the Apostles apart, and the Evan∣gelists apart: how come they now to be repeated? why committeth the
Church a tautologie in her menologie? what needeth this sacred  or congeries of feasts, blending of devotions, thrusting all Saints into one day, and that a short one in the rubricke? It is that men may see by that which we doe what we beleeve in that Article of our Creed, the com∣munion of Saints. Wee joyne them all in one collect, wee remember them all upon one day, because they are all united into one body, admitted into one society, naturalized into one Kingdome, made free Denisons of one City, and partakers of oneCol. 1.12. inheritance of the Saints in light. In a word, we keep one feast for them all upon earth, because they all keep one everla∣sting feast in heaven, the marriageApoc. 19.9. supper of the Lambe. The Romanes, beside severall Temples dedicated to severall deities, had their Pantheon, or all-gods temple. See wee not in the skie here single starres glistering by themselves, there constellations, or a concourse of many heavenly lampes joyning their lights? do we not heare with exceeding delight in the singing of our Church Anthemes, first single voices answering one the other, and after the whole Quire joyning in one, as it were tracing the same musicall steps? hath not nature drawne with her pensill a perfect grasse green in the Emrald, a skie colour in the Saphir, the glowing of fire in the Carbuncle, the sanguine complexion in the Ruby, and the twinckling of the starres in the Diamond, and all these together in the Opall, which hath in it the lustre and beautifull colours of all these precious stones,Plin. nat. hist. l. 37 c 6. In Opale est Carbunculi tenuior ignis, Amethysti ful∣gens purpura, Smaragdi vi∣rens mare, &c. incredibili misturâ lu∣centes? Such is this feast of all holy ones: it is the Churches , the Ka∣lendars pandect, as it were a constellation not of many, but of all the starres in the skie: in it as in the Opall shine the beautifull colours and resplenden∣cy of all those precious stones which are laid in theApoc. 21.19. foundation, and shine in the gates and walls of the heavenly Jerusalem. Upon it we celebrate the chastity of all Virgins, the simplicity of all Innocents, the zeale and cou∣rage of all Confessours, the patience of all Martyrs, the holinesse of all Saints. Upon this day the Church militant religiously complementeth with the Church triumphant, and all Saints on earth keep the feast, and expresse the joy, and acknowledge the happinesse, and celebrate the memory, and imbrace the love, and set forth the vertues of all Saints in heaven. Which are principally three, shadowed by the allegory in my Text: 1. Patience in tribulation, They came out. 2. Purity in conversation, And washed their garments. 3. Faith in Christs death and passion, Made them white in &c. The better to distinguish them, you may if you please terme them three markes: 1. A blacke or blewish marke made with the stroake or flaile, Tribulation. 2. A white made by washing their garments, and whiting them. 3. A red, by dying them in the bloud of the Lambe. 1. First of the blacke or blew marke, They came out of great tribulati∣on. The beloved Apostle and divine Evangelist Saint John, who lay in the bosome of our Saviour, and pryed into the very secrets of his heart, in the time of his exile in Pathmos had a glimpse of his and our country that is above; and was there present in spirit at a solemne investiture or installa∣tion
of many millions of Gods Saints into their state of glory, and order of dignity about the Lambe in his celestiall court. The rite and ceremony of it was thus, The twelveVer. 5, 6, 7, 8. Tribes of Israel were called in order, and of every Tribe twelve thousand were sealed in the forehead by an Angel keeper of the broad Seale of the living God (Ver. 2.) After this signature; Loe a great multitude, which no man can number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the Throne, and before the Lambe, and they had long white robes put upon them, and palmes given them in their hands in to∣ken of victory, and they marched on in triumph singing with a loud voice, Salvation from or to our God that sitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lambe: at which words all the Angels that stood round about the Throne, and the Elders, and the foure living creatures full of eyes fell before the Throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, Amen: Praise, and glory, and wise∣dome, and thankes, and honour, and power, and might be unto our God for e∣ver and ever, Amen. This glorious representation of the triumphant Church so overcame and tooke away the senses of the ravished Apostle, that though he desired nothing more than to learne who they were that he had seen thus honourably installed, yet he had not the power to aske the question of any that assisted in the action, till one of the Elders rose from his seate to entertaine him, and demanded that of him which hee knew the Apostle knew not, but most of all desired to know, and would have en∣quired after, if his heart had served him: viz. who they were, and whence they came that were admitted into the order of the white robe in Heaven. The answer of which question when the Apostle had modestly put from himselfe to the Elder, saying, Lord thou knowest, the Elder courteously re∣solveth it, and informeth him particularly concerning them, saying: These are they that are come out of great tribulation, &c. Thou mightest per∣haps have thought, that these who are so richly arrayed and highly ad∣vanced in Heaven, had been some great Monarchs, Emperours, or Poten∣tates upon earth, that had conquered the better part of the world before them, paving the way with the bodies, and cementing it with the bloud of the sline, and in token thereof bare these palmes of victories in their hands. Nothing lesse; they are poore miserable forlorne people that are newly come some out of houses of bondage, some out of the gallies, some out of prisons, some out of dungeons, some out of mynes, some out of dens and caves of the earth, all out of great tribulation. They who weare now long white robes mourned formerly in blacke: they who now beare palmes in their hands, carried their crosses in this world: they who shout and sing here, sighed and mourned under the heavie burdens of ma∣nifold afflictions all the dayes of their pilgrimage on earth: they whom thou seest the Lambe leading to theVer. 17. living fountaines of waters, dranke before deep of the waters of Marah, and full cups of teares in the ex∣treme heate of bloudy persecutions: and in consideration of the great tri∣bulation which they have patiently endured for the love of their Redee∣mer, he bestoweth upon them these glorious robes whited in his own bloud, and hee taketh them neere to himselfe, that they may stand before him for evermore. Mat. 5, 11, 12.Blessed, thrice blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousnesse
sake, for great is their reward in heaven. The heavier their crosse is, the weightier their crowne shall bee: their present sorrowes shall free them from all future sorrowes; their troubles here shall save them from all trou∣ble hereafter; their temporall paines through his merits for whom they suffer, shall acquit them from eternall torments; and the death of their bo∣dy, through faith in his bloud, shall redeeme them from death of body and soule, and exempt them from all danger, miserie and feare. Which privi∣ledges the spirit sealeth unto them in the verses following, TheyRev. 7.15.16.17. are be∣fore the Throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple: and he that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them, and shall lead them into li∣ving fountaines of waters, and God shall wipe away all teares from their eyes. These are they that came out of great tribulation. Great tribulation in the judgement of Marlorat is a periphrasis of the last persecution of the Church by Antichrist, which shall be the hottest service the souldiers of Christ shall ever be put to. As the last endevour of nature before death putteth the patient to most paine, and the last assault of Pharaoh put the Israelites to the greatest extremity; so the last persecution of the Church by Antichrist shall exceed all the former.Mat. 24.29. For then the sunne (that is, the knowledge of the truth, or the light of Gods countenance) shall be darkned: and the moon (that is, the beauty of the Church) shalbe obscured & turned into bloud; (that is, deformed by bloudy persecutions:) and the stars shall fall from heaven, (that is, the greatest lights of the Church shall fall from it) and there shalbe such perplexity and distresse of nations as never was before: then, asAug. ep 80. Tunc Ecclesia non apparebit, impiis ultra modum perse∣quentibus. St. Augustine inferreth, the Church shall have no outward appearance, wicked men raging and cruelly persecuting her above measure. But I see no reason why we should restraine tribulation to persecution, or persecution to that of Antichrist. For every great affliction and heavie crosse which the faithfull beare in this world, be it losse of goods, or of friends, banishment, imprisonment, infamy, torture of body, or vexation of mind, is great tribulation, through which any elect child of God may enter into heaven. Albeit we yeeld Martyrs a precedency amongst Saints, yet they alone enter not into their masters joy. Let their garlands have a red rose added unto it, and their crowne a rubie above the rest; yet assuredly all other that areApoc. 2.10. faithfull unto death shall receive the crowne of life: all that fight a good fight, and keepe the faith, after they have finished their course shall receive a crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give at that day to all that love his appearing. The article  there∣fore is not , but : not demonstrative, pointing to any singu∣lar persecution; but intensive, intimating that many and very great tribula∣tions abide the faithfull servants of God, and they must through them enter in∣to the kingdome of heaven: their life is nothing else but aHieron. ep. ad Heliodor. Etras frate, erras si unquam putas Christianum persecutionem non pati; tunc maximè oppug∣natis, si te op∣pgnati nescis. race of patience through many tribulations, and a battell of faith against all kind of tempta∣tions. A Christian is never without an enemy to persecute him inwardly or outwardly: even this is a temptation of the Divell, to thinke that wee are at any time free from all temptation. For either wee are in warre with the World, Flesh, and the Divell, or God will fight against us: either we are
afflicted for our sinnes, or afflicted with our sinnes: and if God for a long time spare us, even this afflicteth us that we are not afflicted. For sith God afflicteth them whom he affecteth, we have just cause to feare, because wee are not under his rod we are out of his care; and that therefore he chasten∣eth us not here, because he reserveth us to eternall torments. If any demand why God carrieth a more severe hand over his children than over the wic∣ked that deserve lesse favour; I answer by propounding them the like questions: Why doth a father when hee seeth two boyes fighting in the street correct his sonne and not the other? Why doth the Schoolemaster take a stricter account of the Scholar hee best affecteth than of others, whom hee suffereth often to play the trewants? Why doth the husband∣man let unfruitfull and unsavory trees grow out at length without any cut∣ting or pruning, but pruneth the fragrant roses, and pricketh the fruitfull vines till they bleed? Why doth the Physician when hee seeth his patient desperate, give order to them that are about him to deny him nothing that he hath a mind unto? but if he hath any hope of recovery of any patient of his, he keepeth him in diet, forbiddeth him such things as he most desireth, and prescribeth for him many meats, drinkes, and potions which goe against his stomacke. Lastly, why doth a Captaine set the best Souldiers in the forefront of a battell, and appointeth them to enter at a breach, with ap∣parent hazzard of their lives? To the first question they will answer, that a wise father taketh up his son sharply, and correcteth him for his misdemeanour, and not the other, be∣cause he hath a speciall care of his sonnes behaviour, and not of the other: thus let them thinke of the Father of Spirits his dealing with his children, who chasteneth those faults in them which he seemeth to winke at in others, because he beareth a singular affection to his owne, and hath a speciall care of their nurture. To the second they will answer, that a good schoolemaster taketh a more strict account of his best scholar, and more often plyeth him with the rod or feruler than any other, because he most desireth his profit: let them thinke so of our heavenly Teacher, that hee holds a stricter hand over those in Christs schoole who outstrip others, that they may more profit by him. To the third they will answer, that an understanding husbandman let∣teth other trees grow to their full length without cutting or pruning them, because they are good for nothing but for fire wood; but he pruneth the roses to make them more savoury, and the vines to make them more fruit∣full: let them thus conceive of themselves, that they are like vines that runne into luxuriant stemmes, and roses apt to grow wilde: therefore God the Father, whoJohn 5.1. is an husbandman, pruneth them to make them more savourie in their prayers and meditations, and more fruitfull in good workes. To the fourth they will answer, that the Physician doth according to his art to cure the body; and God doth the like in wisedome to cure the soule: they whom he ordereth not, setting them in a course of physick, but letteth them doe what they will, and have what they call for, are in a de∣sperate case.
To the last they will answer, that the experienced Captaine setteth the most valiant souldiers in places of greatest danger, that they may get the greater honour; so doth God set the most valiant Christian upon the most dangerous service, that thereby he may gaine greater honour, and a more massie crowne of glory. Moreover, sinne taketh us oftentimes after the na∣ture of a falling sicknesse, out of which our heavenly Father awaketh us by the stroake of his rod. Whereby also hee beateth downe the pride of our flesh, and keepeth us alwayes in awe, and constraineth us to cry aloud unto him in our prayers: he maketh us sensible of our sinnes, and compassionate of our brethrens misery, and conformable to the image of his Sonne. Hee weaneth us from this world, and breedeth in us a longing desire to ex∣change this vale of teares with the river of pleasures springing at his right hand in Heaven. If God should not send us sometimes crosses and afflicti∣ons, and sawce our joyes with sorrowes, wee would often surfet of them, we would take too great liking to this world, and say with Peter, It is good being here, let us pitch our tents, and take up our rest here. This might suffice for the clearing of the first doctrine of this Text, but that I fore-see an objection that may be made against it. How say I tri∣bulation or afflictions are markes of Gods children, sith wee see the wic∣kedest men that breath sometimes full of them? Are not notorious male∣factors often apprehended, cast in prison, scourged to death, tortured upon the rack, broken upon the wheele, and executed with other most exquisite torments? Do not all the plagues threatned in the Law fall upon some of Gods enemies in this life? Are not the very dregges of his vialls of venge∣ance poured upon them? For your full satisfaction herein, I propound these ensuing observations to your serious thoughts. 1. Albeit the judgements of God fall heavily in this life upon some no∣torious, obstinate and impenitent sinners; yet for the most part the rod of God falleth to the lot of the righteous: more of them are afflicted, and they more afflicted than usually the wicked are, who with Dives take their pleasure here, because, as the Psalmist speaketh, theirPsal. 17.14. portion is in this life. 2. Though afflictions in some sort are common to all sorts of men, yet chastisements and corrections (meant by the word tribulation in my Text) are proper to the godly. The calamities and afflictions that befall the ungodly are punishments for their sinnes, not chastisements for their good; effects of Gods justice, not tokens of his love: they are sent to them for their ruine and destruction, not for their amendment and instruction. 3. Afflictions taken by themselves are not notes or markes of Gods children, but afflictions with patience, and tribulation with joy: crosses heavier or lighter are laid upon all men, but none bear them chearfully save Gods children. The wicked when they feele the hand of God upon them, rise up against him, but the godly submit themselves under his mighty hand, and commit their soules to him as their faithfull Creatour: the wickedRevel. 16.12. gnaw their tongues and curse, but the godlyJob 1.21. blesse and praise God: the wicked have little or no sense of the wrath of God or their sinne, but of their pu∣nishment; but the godly are much more grieved at the wrath of God and
their sinne than their punishment: the wicked have alwayes their eyes up∣on their wounds, stripes and sores, but the godly on the hand that smiteth them; which when they see to be the hand of their heavenly Father, they compose themselves to patience, they humble themselves before him, and confesse their sinne, they open all their wounds and sores, crying with that religious Father, hic ure, hic seca, here burne, here lance, here pricke my veines, here feed me with the bread of affliction, here give me my full draught of the cup of teares, that all teares may be wiped from my eyes here∣after; chasten and judge me here, that I be not condemned with the world. This holyAug. de Civit. Dei, l. 1. c. 8. Ma∣net dissimilitu∣do passorum e∣tiam in simili∣tudine passio∣nis: et licet sub eodem tor∣mento non est idem virtus at∣que vitium: nam sicut sub codum igne aurum rutilat, palea fumat, & sub eâdem tri∣bulâ stipulae comminuuntur, frumenta pur∣gantur, &c. ita una eademque vis irruens, bo∣nos probat, pu∣rificat, eliquat, malos damnat, vastat, extermi∣nat. Father elsewhere lively expresseth the difference betweene the godly in their sufferings, and the wicked, by the similitude of the same flayle that striketh the corne out of the eare, but bruiseth the stubble; the same fire that purgeth the gold, but consumeth the drosse; the same motion that cau∣seth an ointment to send forth a most fragrant smell, but a sinke to exhale a most noysome savour. The godly are whole under the flayle of tribulation; their faith like gold shineth in that fire, in which the hypocrites smoake like chaffe; their devotion sendeth forth a most sweet savour, when they poure out their soules before God, but the wickeds consciences being troubled, like sinkes that are stirred, exhale most pestilent aires, breathing out blas∣phemies and execrations. In a word, the wicked and godly come out of great tribulation, but the godly come out of it cleane, the wicked foule; the one with their garments soyled and rayed, the other with their garments wash∣ed and made white. They washed their garments and made them white. Thus having descried all holy ones by their blew marke, let us now view the white; they have washed, . Pareus acutely notes, that it is not here said that the SaintsComment. in Apoc. c. 7. doe wash, but have or had washed their garments. For indeed there is no washing in heaven, because there can no impure thing enter there: he that is uncleane at his death remaines uncleane still. For, as St.Cypr. ad Demet. Postquam hinc excessum fuerit nullus est jam poenitentiae lo∣cus, nullus est satisfactionis effectus; hic vita aut amitti∣tur aut tenetur. Cyprian truely informeth Demetrian, After we are gone from hence there is no place for repentance, no effect of satisfaction; here eternall life is got or lost. Here one drop from our eyes can fetch out that spot which an ocean cannot doe hereafter. Let us seeke God therefore while he may be found, strive to en∣ter in before the gate of mercy be locked up, worke while we have day, wash while we have water and soape, doe good while we have time, breake off our sinnes, and wash our polluted consciences with our penitent teares, and purge them with hyssop dipt in Christs bloud, before we heare that dread∣full order read in our eares;Apoc. 22.11. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still: behold I come, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his workes shall be. The whitenesse here of the garments of them whom Saint John saw invested, signifieth the can∣dor and purity of their life, without spot of foule sinne, or staine of infa∣my. This is a conspicuous note of Gods children,Phil. 2.15, 16. who shine as lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, holding forth the word of life. It is not enough to have a cleere conscience within us, we must see that ourMat. 5.16. workes so shine before men, that they may see them, and glorifie our Fa∣ther that is in heaven. To represent this outward purity and integrity of the Saints to theApoc. 19.8. wife of the Lambe, it was granted, that she should be arrayed
in fine linnen, cleane and white: for the fine linnen, saith St. John, is the righteousnesse of Saints. As vertue inArist. ethic l. 8. . Aristotles time was the character of a Grecian, and vice of a Barbarian; so in the first and best ages of the Church a Christian was distinguished from a Heathen by his innocency and charity: they suffered all, they offered no wrong; they visited the sicke how infectious soever the disease was, they defended the fatherlesse and the widow, and kept themselves unspotted of the world: the light of their good workes so dazled the eyes of the Infidels, that even malice it selfe confes∣sed them to be good men.Tert. in Apolog. Bonus Caius tantummodo malus quod Christianus. Caius is an honest man, hee hath but one fault, that he is a Christian: I could love Seius with all my heart, setting aside his religion. Such speeches Tertullian over-heard the Gentiles use concerning those innocent lambes in his dayes, which were dayly sacrificed by the Roman Emperours. Doubtlesse, as the purer bloud in the veines causeth a better colour and complexion in the outward parts; so the purer the faith and religion is, it begetteth alwayes in all the sincere professours thereof a holier life and conversation. You will object, that as when a law was made among the Romans that chast Matrons should weare a kind of girdle to distinguish them fromBodin de rep. Cur∣tizans, that all the Curtizans in Rome, though never so dissolute, got on those girdles: so that if outward conformity and purity in conversation be given for a note of a Saint, that many Hypocrites, Heretickes, and Schisma∣tikes will lay a faire claime to sanctity. For Priscillian was of a most strict life, Novatus outstripped most catholike Bishops in outward appearance and semblance of holinesse, John of Constantinople, who first usurped the ti∣tle of universall Bishop, for his continuall fasting and praying was sirnamed , Jejunator, the Faster: but I answer withLib. 2. de ani∣ma. Non urit ignis pictus, nec rugit leo marmoreus. Lodovicus Vives, Paint a fire most artificially, yet it will not burn; it may deceive the sight, but not the touch. Cut the proportion of a Lion in marble, or carve it in wood, and lay live colours upon it; yet be confident this wooden or marble Lion wil never roare, much lesse devoure. The grapes wch Zeuxis painted had the colour, but not the taste of grapes: a glow worme hath the light, but not the heat of fire: a counterfeit stone hath the lustre, but not the vertue of a pretious stone: hypocrisie, heresie, and schisme have the vizard, but not the face of holinesse: their outward con∣formity, and seeming sanctity, differeth from theirs who are holy ones in∣deed, in three things: 1 It is not sincere. 2 Not entire. 3 It is not permanent or constant. 1 It is not sincere: pone in pectore dextram, nil calet: though their veines swell, and their faces be as red as bloud, as if they were all fire and made of zeale; yet if you could put your hand into their bowels, you should find their heart either but key cold or luke warm, like a false gemme in which the light is in the outside onely, and not in the body of the stone. Such is their zeale and precise purity, in which they will streine at the gnat of a ceremony and harmelesse custome in publike, and yet swallow a Camel of ougly heresie, or beastly sensuality, or biting usury, or abominable sacriledge in
private.Prov. 30.12. They are a generation pure in their owne eyes, but yet are not washed from their filthinesse: they, as St.Greg. mor. in Job l. 34. Quasi habitam san∣ctitatem ante oculus homi∣num videntur amittere, sed eam ante ocu∣los Dei nun∣quam habue∣runt. Gregory speaketh, may seeme in the eyes of men to be cloathed with holinesse, but in Gods eyes they are starke naked. 2 It is not entire: if they are forward in the duties of the first table, you shall take them tardy in the duties of the second: if they are strict one way, you shall finde them loose enough another way: like Numa they have a Nymph Aegeria in a corner, some private sinne which they hugg in their bosome, either of covetousnesse, as Seneca; or of ambition, as John the Faster; or wantonnesse, as Montanus; or fraudulent lying and cousening, as Priscillian; or spirituall pride and uncharitable censuring of others, as Novatus. 3 It is not constant: their sanctity is like painted beauty, which is wash∣ed away with a storme, or drops over a fire: they are true Ephraimites, TheirHos. 6.4. goodnesse is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away: their over hot zeale soone slaketh, and their charity in time waxeth cold. Fained things, saith the Oratour, like blossomes soone fall, or are blowne away with a puffe of winde; true vertue taketh root and propagateth it selfe. The experience of all times maketh it good, that those things which have had but a shew of appearance, have had but a thought of continuance. We have discerned the Saints by two markes, their blew and their white: there remaines yet one more, their red marke. They have died their garments In the bloud of the Lambe; that is, their owne innocent bloud, saith Saint Austin: but herein venerable Beda shooteth neerer to the marke: They washed their garments, and made them white in the bloud of Christ, who is the Lambe of God that taketh away the sins of the world. SaintAug. Serm. 2. de sanct. Stolas Martyres laverunt dum membra sua quae oculis in∣sipientium visa sunt poenarum squalore foeda∣re, sic potius fu∣so pro Christo sanguine ab omnibus mun∣davere conta∣giis. Austin indeed drawes a fine line, but without the rules of the text: The Martyrs, saith hee, washed their robes in bloud when they cleansed their members from all conta∣gion by their bloud shed for Christ, wherewith in the eyes of fools they seemed to defile and deforme their bodies. But neither is it said here they washed their robes in sanguine agnino, or sanguine suo, but sanguine , which Beza well rendereth agni illius: they washed not their garments in their owne bloud, or lambes bloud simply, butBeza annot. in Apoc. the bloud of that lambe, who, ver. 17. shall feede them and leade them unto living fountaines of waters. Neither is it the bloud which we shed for Christ, but the bloud which Christ shed for us, thatJohn 1.7. cleanseth us from all sin. It is true, that the bloud of Martyrs shed for the testimony of the Gospell, is a most acceptable sacrifice unto God; yet not propitiatory for their or our sinnes. Bloud spilt for Christ is no staine but an ornament; it doth no way deforme the body of a Mar∣tyr, as the foolish heathen imagined, whom Saint Austin there justly tax∣eth, but maketh them more lovely in the eyes of God and all his Saints: yet because their bloud is some way defiled, it cannot cleanse or purge, much lesse make white their, or our robes. These are the three privi∣ledges of the cleane and pure bloud of the immaculate Lambe Christ Je∣sus, which
Apoc. 1.5. Washeth. John 1.7. Cleanseth. Apoc. 7.14. Whiteth. It washeth us in our regeneration, cleanseth us in our justification, and whiteth us in our glorification: it washeth away the filth of sinne in our re∣generation, it cleanseth us from the guilt of sinne in our justification, and maketh us white, that is, perfectly just and righteous, not by imputation only, but by inhesion; or, as the schooles speake, inherent righteousnesse in ourHeb. 12 23. To the spirits of just men made perfect. glorification. They washed Their robes. Not their robe in the singular, but their robes in the plurall number; because as every guest at the Kings supper had his peculiar wed∣ding garment, so here every Saint hath his robe of glory: all are long and downe to the feet, yet some longer than other, according to their stature that ware them. For the proportion of glory in heaven answereth the proportion of grace here. Some straine the letter farther, and from hence inferre, that all Saints have a double robe given unto them; one in this life, another in the life to come: the one washed indeed, but yet not with∣out some spots cast upon it through carnall frailty, which are covered by Christ; the other is whited, and without any spot or staine, and this is re∣served for us in the wardrob of heaven. But I rather inferre from hence, that if there be such vertue in Christs bloud, that it not onely washeth the Saints robes, but maketh them perfectly white: if it can change the colour & hiew of any sinne of the deepest dye, and though it be asEsay 1.18. red as scarlet, make it as white as wooll; that there is no need at all of Romish holy water, or Ma∣ries milke, or the soape of Saints merits. If Christs bloud purgeth us from all sinne, and all drosse is sinne, what remaines for Purgatory fire to worke upon, but the gold of their purses that have faith in those imaginary flames? St.Delicatus est Christi sanguis, alienum non patitur. Bernard truely observeth, that the bloud of the Lambe is most pure and delicate bloud, it will endure no mixture with any other thing. All things by the law were purified by the bloud of sacrifices, and in the Gospel by the sacrifice of Christs bloud. Yea, but it is said,Acts 15.9. Faith purifieth the heart; how then is it here said, that their robes were washed and made white with Christs bloud? I answer, that Christs bloud whiteth as the soape or nitre, but faith as the hand of the Laundresse. Christs bloud healeth us as the plaister, faith as the finger of the Apothecary applying it. Christs merits and death acquit and free us as the ransome tendered for our redemption, faith is as the hand that re∣ceiveth this summe from Christ, and tendereth it to the Father for the re∣deeming of our soules. When the Temple of Jerusalem was on fire, no∣thing could quench the flame but the bloud of the slain: in like maner, when Gods wrath is kindled against his servants, which are living Temples of the Holy Ghost, nothing can quench the flame, but the bloud of the immacu∣late Lambe, that was slaine from the beginning of the world. Secondly, from hence I would inferre for the comfort of all affrighted consciences, that if they have renued their covenant in Christs bloud, and purified their hearts by faith before their death, they need not feare to
come into the presence of God. For though his eyes are most pure, and they full of sores and corruption; yet they need not any way be dismaid, because there shall be long white robes given unto them, to cover all from the sight of God. Mary Magdalen washed Christs feet with her teares, but Christ washeth not onely our feet, but our hands, head, and whole bo∣dy with his owne bloud; and thereby fetches out all the staines of our con∣sciences, and makes our soules appeare most faire and lovely in the eyes of Almighty God. O royall bath! O the true Mare rubrum, or red Sea, in which the spirituall Pharaoh and all his host are destroyed, and through which we passe not, as the Jewes did, into the wildernesse, but into Para∣dise! In this royall bath, or rather indeed red Sea of Christs bloud, I will drown my discourse at this present, and shut up all with that Epipho∣nema of St. John:Apoc. 1.5.6. To him that loved us, and washed our sinnes in his owne bloud, and hath made us Kings and Priests to God and his Father: to him be glory and dominion for ever, Amen.
SERMONS PREACHED AT SERJEANTS-INNE IN FLEETSTREET.
THE CHRISTIAN VICTORIE. THE XXV. SERMON. APOC. 2.17. To him that overcommeth will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it. Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. MEdals and small pictures that are shewed us under the co∣ver of a chrystall glasse are most delightfull to the eye:Pref. such are the images of divine truth, and heads of hea∣venly doctrine, whereof you have a glympse in my text, through the mirrour of an elegant allegorie. The glasse of art giveth both light to the pictures, and delight to the beholders. Notwithstanding for your more exact view, and my parti∣cular handling of them, I will open the Chrystall cover, and take them out one by one in order as they are set in the letter; wherein 1 A condition is propounded, to him that overcommeth. 2 A promise upon condition is made, I will give.Divis. 3 Three gifts upon promise are specified; 1 Hidden Manna (which some make) a type of election. 2 A white stone, an embleme of justification. 3 A new name, an imprese of glorification. In the review of the words marke, I beseech you, the connexion of
the doctrinall points which stand as it were out of the words. 1 No man knoweth the new name, save he that receiveth it. Connex.2 No man receiveth it, but he that hath the white stone. 3 No man hath the white stone, but he that eateth the Manna. 4 No man eateth the hidden Manna, but he to whom it is given. 5 It is given to none to eate thereof, but to him that overcommeth the Divell by his faith, the World by his hope, the Flesh by his charity, all baites and allurements by his abstinence, all crosses and afflictions by his patience, all conflicts and assaults of temptations by his constant perseve∣rance unto the end. Obser.1 It is said to him that overcommeth, to include our labour and industry: yet it is added, I will give, to exclude merit. 2 It is said  to him, that is, to every one, (for an indefinite propofi∣tion in materiâ necessariâ, is equivalent to an universall) to teach us, that the promises of the Gospel are generall: yet to the  is added , to him that overcommeth, to shew us that this generality is conditionall. 3 The Spirit saith not to him that fighteth, but to him that overcom∣meth. All vertues adorne a Christian, but perseverance alone crowneth him. 4 To him that overcommeth the Spirit saith not I will give to see, but to eat of the hidden Manna, and receive the white stone, with the new name. Our eternall happinesse consisteth not in the bare contemplation, but fruition of the hidden Manna, the white stone, and the new name. 5 It is not Manna simply, but the hidden Manna: nor a stone, but a white stone: nor a name, but a new name: every subject hath here his adjunct, every face his shadow, every letter his flourish, every diamond his foile, every kind his quality. All Manna is not the hidden: what is this hidden Manna? All pretious stones are not the white: what is this white stone? All names are not new names: what is this new name? O thou who hast the key of David, and openest and no man shutteth, open the treasure of this Scripture, that we may see what heavenly mysteries lie in this hidden Manna, are engraven in this white stone, and character'd in this new name. The prophecies in the Old and New Testament like the Cherubins in the Arke looke one upon the other: Alter in alterius jacientes lumina vultum. You shall hardly light upon any vision or revelation in this booke con∣cerning the succeeding estate of the Church, which hath not some kind of reference to the predictions of the ancient Prophets of things already ac∣complished. God, to whom all things past and future are eternally present, in his infinite wisedome hath so fitted latter events to former presidents, that the same perspectives of Propheticall visions, for the most part, in which holy men under the law saw things now long past, serve St. John to represent unto him the image of the last times, even till our Lords second comming. For brevity sake at this time I will instance onely in my text, where every word is a relative. The first, vincenti, referreth you to
Job 7.1. Is not the life of man a warfare upon earth? The second, Dabo, I will give, to Luke 12.32. It is your Fathers pleasure to give you a king∣dome. The third, Manna absconditum, the hidden Manna, to Exod. 16.33. Take a pot, and put an Omer full of Manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your generations. The fourth, Calculum candidum, the white stone, to Esay 28.16. Behold, I lay in Zion a tried stone, a pretious stone. The fift, novum Nomen, a new name, to Esay 62.2. And thou shalt be called by a new name. Christ who hath overcome the world, under these metaphors looking to foregoing prophesies and promises, incoura∣geth all Christians like valiant Souldiers to follow him, setting before them all spirituall delicacies, implyed in the hidden Manna, all treasures in the white stone, all true honour in the new name. To him that overcommeth plea∣sure, and abstaines from sinfull delights, I will give hidden Manna. To him that overcommeth covetousnesse, and esteemeth not of worldly wealth and earthly treasure, I will give a white stone. To him that overcommeth ambi∣tion, and seeketh not for a name upon earth, I will give a new name, written in heaven. In many other texts the letter is easie, but the spirituall meaning difficult: but on the contrary, in this the spirituall meaning is facile, and out of question, but the letter is much controverted. For some contend, that the metaphor is here taken from the manner of feasting great Persona∣ges, wherein the Prince, Ambassadour, or great States-man is entertained with rare and reserved dainties, served in under covered dishes; and after the last course hath a medall, or a stone with his name engraven in it, and a posie given unto him; which, because he carrieth away with him, and keepeth it as a memoriall of his honourable entertainement, the Greekes call : this is Alcasar his conceit. Others place the Scene, if I may so speake, in a Greene, where he that out-runneth the rest, receiveth a white stone: this is Aretus his ghesse. A third sort of Expositors runne upon a pitched field, which he that wanne had his victory with his name entred into the Roman Fasti with a white stone: this is Sixtus Senensis his interpretation. But the most of our later Commentatours imagine, that Christ had an eye to the Roman Judiciall proceedings in their Courts, in which he that overcame his accuser, and had the better of the cause, was absolved by the Judges casting white stones into an urne or pitcher. Mos erat antiquis, niveis, atris{que} lapillis His damnare reos, illis absolvere culpâ. But sith wee have the Jewell, let us not much trouble our selves about the casket: let us not contend about the shell, but rather taste the ker∣nell. To him, that is, to every one. As Dido at the building of Carthage offe∣red like priviledges to the Tyrians and Trojans, saying,Virg. Aen. 4. Tros, Tyrius{que} mihi nullo discrimine agetur: so Christ in the building of the spirituall Je∣rusalem, which is his Church, putteth no difference betweene Jew and Gentile, but propoundeth salvation upon like conditions of repentance and faith unto all. At his incarnation he tooke not upon him the singular person of any man, but the common nature of all men, and accordingly offered
himselfe a surety for all mankinde, laying downe a sufficient ransome for all, and inviting all by the hand of faith to take so much as may serve to free themselves, and satisfie for their debt.Esay 55.1. Ho, every one that thirsteth, saith the Prophet, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money: come ye, buy ye wine and milke without money, and without price.John 7.37. If any man thirst, saith our Saviour, let him come unto me and drinke. He that beleeveth on me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.Mat. 11.28. Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavie laden, and I will give you rest.Apoc. 3.20. Behold, I stand at the doore, and knocke: if any man heare my voyce, and open the doore, I will come in to him, and will sup with him. In the law of Moses there is a great difference between the Jew and the Gentile; but in Christ there is none at all: we who were sometimes farre off, are made nigh by his bloud.Ephes 2.14. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken downe the middle wall of partition betweene us. Through him we have an accesse by one Spirit unto the Father.ver. 18. Now therefore we are no more stran∣gers and forreiners,ver. 19. but fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the houshold of God:Ephes. 3.6. Fellow heires, and of the same body, and partakers of God his pro∣mise in Christ by the Gospell. Now as there is one shepheard, so but one sheepfold: and for this very cause Christ is called Lapis angularis, the cor∣ner stone; because the Gentiles and Jewes, like two sides of a wall, joyne in him, and are built up to make a holy Temple unto the Lord, which is his vi∣sible Church. Neither are the Gentiles onely admitted into the terrestriall Jerusalem and Church militant, but also into the celestiall and Church tri∣umphant. For so we reade, that after thereApoc 7.4.9. were sealed an hundreth and fourty and foure thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel, Loe, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues stood before the throne, and before the Lambe, cloa∣thed with white robes, and palmes in their hands. Before Christ came into the flesh, there was as it were a small wicket open in heaven for the Gentiles, at which some few entered one by one; as Jethro, and Job, and Melchize∣deck, and the King of Nineveh, and the Queene of the South, and some o∣ther: but since the death, resurrection, and ascension of our Lord, wee reade of aApoc. 4.1. great doore opened in heaven, at which great multitudes may en∣ter together. Even from the beginning of Christs comming into the flesh the Gentiles went in equipage with the Jewes. For when the Angell prea∣ched the incarnation of Christ to the Jewes, a new Starre preached it to the heathen Sages, that all men might know, according to Simeon his pro∣phesie, thatLuke 2.32. he was no lesse a light to lighten the Gentiles, than the glory of his people Israel. For this cause we may conceive it was, that he was borne in an Inne, not in a private house; and baptized in the river Jordan, not in a peculiar font; and suffered without the walls of the City, to make it mani∣fest unto us, that the benefit of his incarnation, baptisme, death and passion, is not impropriated to any sort of people, nor inclosed within the pale of Palestine, but like the beames of the Sunne diffused through the whole world. Thus farre we all teach universall grace, that is, the grace and favour of God, offered unto all by the preaching of the Gospell; not the grace (they call sufficient) conferred upon all since Adam's fall. This secret be∣longeth unto God, to whom he will make this offer of grace effectuall;
but that which he hath revealed belongeth to us and our children, thatTit. 2.11, 12, 13. The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared unto all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlinesse and wordly lusts, we should live soberly, righteous∣ly, and godly in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glori∣ous appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ. The2. Tim. 2.19 foundati∣on of God remaineth firme, having this seal, God knoweth who are his, not we. We therefore who are dispensers of the mysteries of salvation, must be open handed unto all, and indifferently tender unto them the pretious pearle which the rich Merchant man sold all that he had to buy. First, because it is Christs expresse command that we should doe so: Goe, saith Christ, preach to all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost. Or as we finde his words related by Saint Marke;Marke 16.15. Goe yee into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every crea∣ture. He that beleeveth, and is baptized shall be saved, but he that beleeveth not shall be damned. 2 Next, Because the Elect could not be called by us who cannot discerne them from the reprobate, if we preached not the Gospell to all without exception. Howsoever therefore our preaching to the reprobate doth them little good, proving no better unto them than a savour of death unto death; yet our labour is not in vaine in the Lord, because in every as∣sembly we may piously hope there may be some if not many of the Elect, to whom the Word will prove a savour of life unto life. 3. Lastly, By thus propounding conditions of peace, and a desire of re∣conciliation on Gods part through Christ unto all, the reprobate are de∣barred of that excuse which otherwise they might use, (viz.) that they would have embraced Christ if he had beene offered unto them, and have walked in the light of the Gospel if it had shined upon them. Tullie speaketh of a Panchrestum medicamentum, a remedy for all disea∣ses; and Plinie of Panaches, a salve for every sore. Such a catholike medi∣cine, such an universall salve is the death and passion of Christ, not only suf∣ficient for all, but also soveraigne and effectuall unto all: but then this poti∣on must be taken, this salve must be applied. And so I fall upon my second note, that though the promises of the Go∣spel are generall without exception; yet they are not absolute without condition. The hidden Manna, and the white stone, and the new name are promised to every one that is so qualified. The promises of the Gospel are generall, that none should dispaire; but yet conditionall, that none should presume. Eternall life by the ministery of the Gospel is offered un∣to all, but upon condition of faith:John 3.16. God so loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne: that whosoever beleeveth in him should not perish, but have life everlasting. Pardon and remission of sinnes is promised unto all, but upon condition of repentance and new obedience:Ezek. 18.21.22 If the wicked will turne from all his sinnes that he hath committed, and keepe all my statutes, and doe that which is lawfull and right, he shall surely live, hee shall not die. All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shal not be mentioned unto him; in his righteousnesse that he hath done, he shall live. Rest is offered unto all, but upon condition of submission to Christs yoake:Mat. 11.29. Take my yoake upon you, and learne of me, for I am meeke and lowly in heart: and you shall finde
rest unto your soules. Salvation is offered unto all, but upon condition ofMat. 13.13. perseverance: he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved. An incorruptible crowne is promised unto all, but upon condition of faithful∣nesse: BeApoc. 2.10. thou faithfull unto death, and I will give thee the crowne of life. Fishermen in their draw-nets use both lead and corke; lead to pull downe some part of it under water, corke to keep the other above. As Fishermen, so likewise the Fishers of men in the draw-net of the Gospel make use both of corke and lead; the generall promises like corke beare us up (in hope) the conditions like lead keep us downe (in feare.) These conditions cannot bee performed without grace; therefore all must implore divine aide: yet grace performeth them not without the concurrence of our will. We must there∣fore exercise our naturall faculties, we must seeke the Kingdome of God, we must strive to enter in at the narrow gate, wee must search for wisedome as for treasure, we must labour for the meat that perisheth not, we must stirre up the graces of God in us, we must work out our salvation with feare and trem∣bling.Cic. lib. 2. de orat. Lepidus lying all along upon the grasse, cryed out, Utinam hoc esset laborare, O that this were to labour and get the mastery; so many stretching themselves upon their ivory beds, and living at ease in Sion, say within themselves, Utinam hoc esset militare, O that this were to goe in warfare, and fight under the crosse: but let them not deceive themselves, heaven is not got with a wish, nor paradise with a song, nor pardon with a sigh, nor victory with a breath, it will cost us many a blow and wound too before we overcome. There can be no conquest without a fight, nor fight without an enemy: who are then our enemies? nay rather who are not? evill angels, men, the creatures, and our selves: angels by suggestions, men by seduction and per∣secution, the creatures by presenting baits and provocations, and our selves by carnall imaginations, lusts, and affections fight against the spirit of grace, and kingdome of Christ in us: Omnes necessarii, omnes adversarii. Against all these enemies of our peace with God wee hang up a flag of defiance in our crisme, and lift up our ensigne when we are crossed in the forehead, and proclaime a warre under Christs banner, (in our renouncing the Divell and all his workes) which beginneth at the Font, and endeth at our Grave. Phi∣lip graced his warre against the Phocenses, and our Ancestors their exploits against the Saracens for Palaestine with the title of Bellum sacrum, the holy Warre: but neither of their expeditions and martiall attempts so properly deserved that appellation, as this I am now to describe unto you. Those warres were for Religion in truth or pretence; but this warre is Religion and true Christianity: and the weapons of this warfare are no other than holy duties and divine vertues, which by some are reduced to three: 1. Prayer, 2. Fasting, 3. Almes-deeds. For, say they, as our enemies are three, the Divell, the Flesh, & the World; so they tempt us to three vices especially, 1. Pride, 2. Luxury, 3. Avarice.
Now our strongest weapon 1 Against pride, is humble prayer. 2 Against luxurie, frequent fasting. 3 Against avarice, charitable almes. Howbeit, though these are the most usuall, and, if I may so speake, portable armes of a Christian; yet there are in his armorie many more, and some more forcible than these, which St.Ephes. 6.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Paul taketh out, and gilds over with these sacred attributes; the sword of the Spirit, the helmet of salvation, the shield of faith, the breast-plate of righteousnesse, the girdle of truth, the shooes of preparation of the Gospel of peace. As this warre is thus holy in respect of the weapons used in it, so much more in respect of the Prince that decreeth it, the Heraulds that proclaime it, the field where it is fought, and the cause for which it is undertaken. The Prince who decreeth this warre is the Holy One of Israel, the Heraulds that proclaime it are the Mi∣nisters of the Gospel, the field where the battell is fought is the militant Church, the end for which it is undertaken is the advancement of Christs kingdome of grace in us, and us in the kingdome of glory. The Roman Historians divide their warres into three kinds; 1 Externa, forreine. 2 Civilia, civill. 3 Servilia, servile. Forreine against other States. Civill against seditious Citizens. Servile against mutinous slaves. This our warre partaketh of all these three kinds, and may be termed both a forrein, a civill, and a servile warre. A forrein, in respect of Sathan and his band. A civill, in respect of the world. A servile, in respect of the flesh and slavish lusts that warre a∣gainst the Spirit. In other warres some are exempted by their calling, as Priests; some by their sexe, as women; some by their yeares, as old men and children; some by their indisposition of body or minde, as sicke and impotent per∣sons not able to beare armes: but in this warre it is otherwise; none can challenge any priviledge. Not Priests, for they blow the trumpet, and give the onset; not children, for as soone as they are borne they are enrolled in the Captaines booke, and are crosse-signed for this service in baptisme: and it may be said of many of them asPet. Dam. serm. de sanct. Vict. Prius vi∣cit quam vince∣re noscet. Damianus spake of St. Victor the con∣fessour, He conquered before he could know what it was to conquer: and St. Cyprian of martyred infants for Christ in his dayes,Cyp. ep. 4. Aetas necdum habilis ad pug∣nam idonea, extitit ad coro∣nam. The age which was not yet fit for warre was found worthy to receive a crowne. Not women, for they fight daily the good fight of faith, and many of them are crowned in
heaven with white and red garlands; white, consisting of lillies, in token of their chastity and innocent purity; red, consisting of roses, in testimony of theirCyp. de a. vig. ortior  viis toquen u ivetutor. blood shed for the name of Christ. Not aged and infirme persons, for like Saint2 Cor 12 10. Paul, when they are weake then they are strong, nay when they are weakest then they are strongest; when they are weakest in body, they are strongest in spirit; when they lye on their death-bed, and are not able to stirre hand nor foot, they grapple with the1 Pet. 5.8. roaring Lion (that runneth about seeking whom hee may devoure) and conquer him by their faith. In o∣ther warres though the fight last many houres, yet in the end either the night, or the weather, or the victory, or the flight on one side parteth the armies, and oftentimes necessity enforceth on both sides a truce for a time: but this warre admitteth no intermission, abideth no peace or truce; all yeelding is death, and treaties of peace mortall. In all other battels hee that killeth conquereth, and hee that is slaine is conquered; but in this the persecuters who slay areCyp. d laps. Seciunt to toquentibus fotors, & pulsantes, & la∣nts un∣las, pulsta & lmat mem∣bra, vicerunt. conquered; and the Martyrs who are slaine, and breath out their soules with a triumphant Io Paean in the flames of fire, are the conquerers.Pareus in A∣poc. Corpora∣liter victi sunt, spiritualitèr vi∣cerunt, dum in verá Christi fi∣de ad mortem us; perstite∣runt. Paraeus expoundeth this riddle, The servants of Christ who seale the truth with their blood, are in their bodies mastered, but in their soules undaunted, and much more unconquered; whilest notwithstanding all the tor∣tures and torments which the malice of man or devill can put them to, they per∣sist in the profession of the true faith unto death: For this is the1 Joh. 5.4. victory of the world, even our faith. In that famous battell at Leuctrum, where the The∣bans got a signall victory, but their Captaine Epaminondas his deaths wound; Plutarch writeth of him that he demanded whether his buckler had beene taken by the enemy, and when hee understood that it was safe, and that they had not laid hands on it, hee died most willingly and cheere∣fully. Such is the resolution of a valiant souldier of Christ Jesus, when hee is wounded even unto death, hee hath an eye to his shield of faith, and fin∣ding that out of the enemies danger, his soule marcheth out of this world, singing Saint Pauls triumphant ditty;2 Tim. 4.7.8 I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth is layd up for me a crowne of righteousnesse. To cleare the summe which I have beene all this while in casting; Chri∣stian victory is a prerogative of the regenerate, purchased unto them by Christs death and resurrection, whereby in all conflicts and temptations they hold out to the end, and in the end overcome on earth, and after tri∣umph in heaven. First, it is a prerogative of the regenerate: for none but those that are1 Joh. 5.4. borne of God overcome the world. Secondly, this prerogative is purchased unto them by Christ, and there∣fore the Apostle ascribeth the glory of it to his grace:1 Cor. 15.57 Thankes bee unto God who giveth us victory through Jesus Christ our Lord. Thirdly, this victory is not in one kinde of fight, but in all, whether Sa∣tan, the world, or the Devill assault us; whether they lay at our understan∣ding by sophisticall arguments, or at our will by sinfull perswasions, or at our senses by unlawfull delights: whether our profession bee oppugned by heresie, or our unity by schisme, or our zeale by worldly policy, or our temperance by abundance, or our confidence in God by wants, or our con∣stancy by persecution, or our watchfulnesse by carnall security, or our per∣severance
by continuall batteries of temptations; in all wee are more than conquerours through him that loved us.Rom. 8.35.36.37. What, or who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distresse, or persecution, or famine, or nakednesse, or perill, or sword? (as it is written, For thy sake wee are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter;) Nay in all these things we are more than conquerours, &c. None can overcome who fighteth not valiantly; none can fight valiantly unlesse they be trained up in Martiall affaires, and provided of good and fit armour both for offence and defence: this spirituall armour is got by in∣stant and constant prayer, and reading and meditating on Gods word; and wee put it on by due application of what wee read and heare; and wee use it by the exercise of those divine vertues above mentioned, from whence the severall pieces of our armour take their names. Moreover, that a man may conquer his enemie, three things are most requisite, 1 Exasperation. 2 Courage. 3 Constancy. Exasperation setteth him on, Courage giveth him strength, and Constan∣cy holdeth out to the end. Exasperation is necessary, because anger (as A∣ristotle teacheth) is the goad or spurre of fortitude: neither indeed can any man maintaine a hot fight in cold blood. And this is the cause why wee are so often put to the worst in our spirituall conflicts, because wee fight like her in the Poet, Tanquam quae vincere nollet; wee fight not in earnest a∣gainst our corruptions, but either in shew onely, dallying, or faintly with∣out any earnest desire of revenge. SaintAug. confess. l. 8. c. 7. In exor∣dio adolescen∣tiae petieram chastitatem sed timebam ne me nimis citò au∣diret, & citò sa∣naret à morbo concupiscen∣tiae, quem ma∣lebam expleri quam extingui. Austine before his thorough con∣version prayed against fleshly lusts, but (as he confesseth with great anguish & sorrow of heart for his insincerity) so aukwardly, & against his will, that secretly hee desired that his lust should rather be accomplished than extin∣guished. As it was then with him, so it is with too many that take upon them the profession of Christians, and would thinke it foule scorne to bee taken for other than true converts. When the voluptuous person offereth a formall prayer to God, to extinguish the impure flame of lust rising out of the cindars of originall sinne, Satan setteth before his fancy the picture of his beautifull Mistresse; and as the Calor ambiens, or outward heat in a bo∣dy disposed to putrefaction, draweth out the naturall heat; so this impure heat of lust draweth out all the spirituall heat of devotion, and so his faint prayer against sinne is turned into sinne. In like manner while the covetous man prayeth against that base affection in his soule, which ever desireth that wherewith it is neverAristophan. in Plut. . Sen. ep. 15. Si quid in his esset solidi, aliquan∣do implerent, nunc haurien∣tium sitim con∣citant. Horat. carm. l. 2. od. 2. Crescit indulgens sibi dirus hydrops, nec sitim pellit, nisi causa morbi fugerit venis, & aquosus albo∣corpore lan∣guor. satisfied, Mammon representeth unto him the rising up of his heapes, and swelling of his bagges by his use-mony, whereby his heart is tickled, and so his prayer also turneth into sinne. Thus all sinners that are not brought to a perfect hatred and detestation of their bosome sinne, even whilest they pray against the forbidden fruit, hold it un∣der their tongue, and their carnall delights suffocate their godly sorrow. Spirituall courage is most necessary, that is, confidence in God and in the power of his might. This confidence is the immediate ef∣fect
of a lively faith, which S. John calleth1 Joh. 5 4. the victory of the world. When Christ bad Peter come to him walking on the sea, upon the rising of a storme Peters faith began to faile, and no sooner his heart sanke in his body, but his feete also sanke in the water; even so when any storme of persecu∣tion ariseth for the word, when wee see our selves encompassed on every side with dangers and terrours, and our faith faileth, wee presently sinke in despaire, if Christ stretch not out his hand presently to support us, and esta∣blish our heart in his promises. 3 Thirdly, constant perseverance is most needfull; for though all ver∣tues runne in the race of a Christian life, yet perseverance alone obtaineth the garland. Suppose a ship to be fraught with rich merchandise, to have held a prosperous course all the way, and escaped both rockes and Pyrats, yet if it bee cast away in the haven, the owner is nothing the better for it, but lo∣seth his goods, fraight, and hope also. For this cause it is that in all the pro∣mises in these letters of the hidden Manna, the white Stone, the water of Life, the tree of Life, the crowne of Life, &c. the onely condition that is ex∣prest is perseverance. To him that overcommeth I will give, &c. for with∣out it faith is not faith, but a wavering opinion; hope is not hope, but a golden dreame; zeale is not zeale, but a sudden heat; joy but a flash, love but a passion, temperance but a physicke diet for a time, valour but a bra∣vado, patience but weake armour notable to hold out. All therefore who expect to eat of the hidden Manna, and receive the white stone with the new name, must get unto themselves, and put on the whole armour of God, and be daily trained in Christs schoole; and when they are called to joyne battell, out of an exasperated hatred against the enemies of their soule, with great confidence and courage fight against Satan and his temptations; the world and all the sinfull allurements in it; the flesh and the noysome lusts there∣of, strenuously, valiantly, and constantly, never putting off their armour till they put off their bodies, nor quitting the field till they enter into the celestiall Canaan, whereof the terrestriall was a type; and what title the Jewes had to the one, wee have to the other, not by purchase, but by pro∣mise: yet as the recovery of that Land cost the Jewes, so the recovery of this costeth the Saints of God much sweat, and blood too sometimes; but neither that sweat nor that blood is the price of the Land of Promise, but theJoh. 7.29. blood of the immaculate Lamb of God that taketh away the sinnes of the world. In which regard the ProphetHos. 10.12. Hosea, having exhorted the people to sow in righteousnesse, varieth the phrase, and saith not yee shall reape in righteousnesse, but, yee shall reape in mercy. Why not reape in righteousnesse as well as sow in righteousnesse? because mans righteousnesse is not answe∣rable to Gods, and therefore hee must plead for his reward at the throne of mercy, not at the barre of justice. For though the wages of sinne is death, yet eternall life is the gift of God by Jesus Christ: to whom bee ascribed, &c.

Wherein you are to observe, 1 Literam Spiritus, The letter of the Spirit. 2 Spiritum Literae, The Spirit of the letter.

temptation, and seeme to be at rest, to looke upon the labell of this crowne, and there wee shall finde it written, Vincenti dabo, To him that overcom∣meth indefinitely, not in one, but in all assaults of temptation; not in one, but in all spirituall conflicts, till hee have overcome the last enemy, which is death. There are many, too many, in the militant Church, who drinke wine in bowles, and sing to the pipe and violl, and never listen to Christs ala∣rum: others there are who hearing the alarum, desire to be entertained in his service, and give their names unto him, but are not like Timothy trained up in Martiall discipline: a third sort like of training well where there is little danger, but when they are to put themselves into the field, like the children of Ephraim, turne backe in the day of battell: lastly, many like the ancient Gauls, begin furiously, but end cowardly; in the first assault they are more than men, in the second lesse than women. None of these shall taste of the hidden Manna, nor handle the white stone, nor read the new name, but they who by a timely resolution give their names to Christ, by pri∣vate mortification, fasting, watching, and prayer, are trained for this service, by faith grapple with their ghostly enemies, and by constancy hold out to the end. For as Hannibal spake sometime to his souldiers, Qui hostem vice∣rit mihi erit Carthaginensis, hee that conquereth his enemy, what countrey man soever hee bee, hee shall bee unto mee a Carthaginian, that is, I will hold him for such, and give him the priviledge of such an one: so Christ speaketh here to all that serve in his warres, Hee that overcommeth his e∣nemie, of what countrey or nation soever hee bee, I will make him free of the celestiall Jerusalem, I will naturalize him in my kingdome in heaven. In other kingdomes there are severall orders ofDiscourse, & l. origin. des ordores milit. p. 49. Knights, as of Malta, of the Garter, of the Golden Fleece, of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Saint Sa∣viour, of Saint James, of the holy Ghost, and divers others: but in the king∣dome of Christ wee finde but one onely sort, viz. the order of Saint Vin∣cents. In all other orders some have beene found , white-livered souldiers, or carpet-Knights, that either never drew sword, nor saw battell, or basely fled from their colours: but of this order never any either fled from his colours, or returned from battell without the spoiles of his ghost∣ly enemies. Hee therefore that will bee of this order must bee of good strength and courage, well armed continually, exercised in Martiall disci∣pline, vigilant to take all advantages, inured to endure all hardnesse: to strength hee must adde skill, to skill valour, to valour industry, to industry patience, to patience constancy, and to all, humility; not to challenge the rewards here proposed as due to his service, but onely by vertue of the pro∣mise of him who here saith, To him that overcommeth I will give. , not , I will render or repay: for it is not so in this warre as in others, wherein the souldier who carrieth himselfe valiantly in warre, and ventureth his life for his Prince and countrey, may challenge his pay of desert; because wee beare not our owne armour, nor fight by our owne strength, nor conquer by our owne valour, nor have any colour for our service on earth to pretend to a crowne in heaven. In which regard though wee may expect, yet not challenge; looke for, yet not sue for; de∣sire, yet not require as due the reward here promised.Luk. 12.32. Feare not little flock, saith our Saviour, for it is your fathers pleasure to give you a kingdome; it is
not his bargaine to sell you it. Albeit the wages of sinne is death, and there we may plead merit: yet the Apostle teacheth us that eternall life is the gift of God. Upon which words SaintL. de grat. & lib. arbit. c. 9. Cum posset dicere, & recte dicere stipen∣dium justitiae vita aeterna, maluit dicere gratia autem vita aeterna, ut hinc intellige∣remus non pro meritis nostris Deum nos ad aeternam vi∣tam, sed pro sua miseratio∣ne vocare, un∣de dicitur in psalmo, coro∣nat te in mise∣ratione. Austines observation is very remarkeable; Whereas the Apostle might have continued his Metaphor, and said, the wages of righteousnesse is eternall life, because eternall life is the reward of righte∣ousnesse, as death is of sinne, yet hee purposely put the word gift in stead of wa∣ges, that wee might learne this most wholesome lesson, that God hath predesti∣nated and called us to eternall life, not for our merits, but of his mercy, accor∣ding to those words of the Psalmist, He crowneth thee in compassion. If there be any merit, in S. Bernards judgement, it is in denying all merit; Sufficit ad me∣ritum scire quod non sufficiant merita. And verily had the Church of Rome all faith, as her proselytes suppose that she hath all the good works, yet her standing upon tearms with God, & pleading merit, would mar all her merit, and justly fasten upon her the ill name of Meretrix Babylonica, the whore of Babylon. For Meretrix, saith Calepine, à merendo sic dicta est, hath her name from meriting. When wee have done all that wee can,Luk. 17.10. Christ teacheth us to say, wee are unprofitable servants, we have done but that which was our duty to doe. Nay, have wee done so much as wee ought to doe? Venera∣ble Bede, to checke our pride who are apt to take upon us for the least good work we doe, telleth us no; quod debuimus facere, non fecimus; we have not done what was our duty to do: and if the best of us have not done what was our duty to doe, wee merit nothing at our Masters hands but many stripes. Yet the Church of Rome blusheth not to define it as a doctrine of faith in her conventicle at Trent, that ourConcil. Trid. sess. 6. Can. 32. Si quis dixerit hominis justifi∣cati bona ope∣ra ita esse dona Dei, ut non sint etiam bo∣na ipsius justi∣ficati merita, aut non vere merere aug∣mentum gra∣tiae & vitam aeternam, ana∣thema sit. good workes doe truely merit eternall life. In which assertion, as Tertullian spake of venemous flowers, quot colores tot dolores, so many colours so many dolours or mischiefes to man; so wee may of the tearmes of this proposition, quot verba tot haereses, so many words so many heresies: for First, it is faith which intituleth us to heaven, not workes, by grace wee are savedEphes. 2.8.9. through faith, and that not of our selves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast. Fides impetrat quod lex imperat, Faith ob∣taineth that which the Law commandeth. Secondly, if workes had any share in our justification, yet we could not merit by them, because as they are ours they are not good, as they are good they are not ours but Gods,Phil. 2.13. who worketh in us both the will and the deed: it is God which worketh in you both to will and to doe of his good pleasure: for2 Cor. 3.5. we are not sufficient of our selves to thinke any thing, as of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God. Whence St.de lib. arbit. c. 7. Si bona sunt, Dei dona sunt; si Dei do∣na sunt, non coronat Deus tanquam meri∣ta tua, sed tan∣quam dona sua. Austin strongly inferreth against all plea of mans merit, If thy works are good they are Gods gifts, if they are evill God crowneth them not; if therefore God crowneth thy workes, he crownes them not as thy merits, but as his owne gifts. Thirdly, the workes that may challenge a reward as due unto them in strict justice must be exactly and perfectly good, but such are not ours.1 Joh. 1.8. For if we say that we have no sinne, or that our best works are not some way tainted, we deceive our selves, and there is no truth in us. Woe (saith St.Confes. l. 13. Vae hominum vitae laudabili, si remota mi∣sericordia discutias eam. Au∣stine) to the commendable life of men, if thou examine it in rigour without mer∣cy. In which passionate straine he seemeth to take the note fromPsal. 130.3. David: If thou Lord shouldest marke iniquities, O Lord who should stand? and hee
fromJob 9.2.3. Job; How should man be just before God? if he contend with him he cannot answer one of a thousand. Fourthly, were our workes free from all aspersion of impurity and suspi∣tion of hypocrisie, yet could they not merit at Gods hands any thing, to whom we owe all that we can or are, Dei omne est quod possumus, quod su∣mus. The greatest Champion of merit Vasques the Jesuit, here yeelds the bucklers, because we can give nothing to God which he may not exact of us by the right of his dominion: we cannot merit any thing at his hand by way of justice. ForVasques in Thom. disput. Non meremur in via justitiae, quia pro eo quod alteri redditranquam debitum, nihil accipere quis debet: & ideo servi intiles dici possumus, quod nihil quasi sponte Deo demus, sed demus ea quae in re do∣minii ex prae∣cepto exigere possit. no man can demand any thing as his due for meer∣ly discharging his debt, no not so much as thankes. Luke 17.9. Doth hee thanke that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. Fiftly, might our workes taken at the best, merit something at Gods hands, yet not eternall life. For there is no proportion betweene our finite workes and such an infinite reward:Aug. in Psal. 36. Quid ap∣pendis cum in∣finito quan∣tumcunque fi∣nitum? no finite thing, be it never so great, canBer. serm. in annunciat. Quid sunt me∣rita ad tantam gloriam? weigh downe that which is infinite. That our workes may beare scale in the Sanctuary, and poyse the re∣ward, five graines must be added to them: 1 Propriety. 2 Liberty. 3 Utility. 4 Perfection. 5 Proportion. First, propriety: wee can merit by nothing that is not our owne worke, no more than wee can oblige a man to us by repaying him his owne coyne. Certainly that which is not our worke is not our merit. Secondly, liberty: wee can challenge nothing by way of merit for a worke, which wee are engaged by duty to performe, no more than oblige a man to us for discharging a bond, which wee were bound under a great penalty by a precise day to satisfie. Thirdly, utility or profit: if that wee doe to another no way advantage him, if hee be no whit the better by it, what colour have wee to exact, or reason to expect a reward from him for such a worke? Fourthly, perfection: unlesse a worke be done sufficiently, the labourer cannot in justice demand his hire, nor the workeman require his price. Fiftly, proportion: no labour or worke can merit more than in true esti∣mation it is worth: the labourer deserveth his hire, such a hire as is corre∣spondent to his paines, but no other. Hee that labours but a day, deserveth not two dayes, much lesse a weeke, or a moneths hire. If the plea of merit is overthrowne by the defect of any one of these con∣ditions, how much more by the defect of all? 1. If wee have no interest in the worke, be it never so meritorious in it selfe, wee cannot merit by it, because it is not ours. 2. Let it bee ours, and meritorious in another that were not bound to performe it, yet weee cannot merit by it if wee are any way obliged in duty to performe it, because it is not free. 3. Let the worke be free, yet if what wee doe no way redound to his benefit from whom we
expect a reward, wee cannot justly demand any recompence from him, be∣cause our worke is not profitable to him. 4. Let the worke be profita∣ble, yet if it bee not done as it should bee in every circumstance, wee cannot sue for the price agreed upon, because the worke is not perfect. 5. Let the worke bee perfect and exact, yet wee can exact no more for it than the skill, or the paines together with the materials deserve. Presse we each of these circumstances, and much more if we presse them all together, they will yeeld the doctrine of SaintBasil. in psal. 114. . Basil upon the 114. Psalme: There re∣maines a rest eternall for them who here strive lawfully, not according to the merit of workes, but according to the grace of our most bountifull God. Let us once more squeze them. First, a meritorious act must be our owne, if wee have any expectance for it; these wee call ours are not so: By the grace of God, saith the Apostle, I am that I am: and his grace in mee was not in vaine: But I laboured more than they all, yet not I, but the1 Cor. 15.10. grace of God which was with mee. And this the ProphtEsay 26.12. Esay professeth in his prayer to God; Lord thou wilt ordaine peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our workes in us. If these texts are not cleare enough, the Apostles question is able to non-plus all the Pelagi∣ans in the world:1 Cor. 4.7. Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou hast not received? There is no good worke which is not compri∣sed within the will or the deed, and both, as we heard before, are the work of grace in us. Upon this firme ground SaintIn psal. 102. Si de tuo retri∣buis peccatum retribuis, om∣nia enim quae habes ab illo habes; tuum so∣lum peccatum habes. Enchirid. ad Laur. c. 302. Ideo dictum intelligitur, non est volen∣tis, ne{que} cur∣rentis, sed mi∣serentis Dei, ut totum Deo de∣tur, qui homi∣nis volunta∣tem bonam & praeparat ad ju∣vandam, & ad∣juvat praepara∣tam. Austine buildeth a strong fort for grace against mans merit: If thou renderest any thing to God of thine owne, thou renderest sinne; for all the good thou hast, thou hast received from God: thou hast nothing which thou maist call thine owne but sinne: And else∣where when the Apostle saith, It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy; wee are thus to understand him, That wee ought to ascribe the whole unto God, who both prepareth the will of man to bee helped, and helpeth it being prepared. Secondly, a meritorious act must be free, in our power, and at our choice to doe or leave undone; our workes are not so: for whenLuk. 17.10. wee have done all that wee can, wee are commanded to say wee are unprofitable servants, we have done that which it was our duty doe. This wedge Marcus theTract. de iis qui putant ex operibus justifi∣cari. c. 2. . Hermite dri∣veth in forcibly: The Lord, saith hee, willing to shew that all the commande∣ments are of duty to be performed, and that the adoption of children is freely gi∣ven to man by his blood, saith, when yee have done all things that are comman∣ded you, say, wee are unprofitable servants, &c. therefore the kingdome of hea∣ven is not the hire of workes, but a gift of the Lord prepared for his faithfull ser∣vants. Thirdly, a meritorious worke must bee of use, and some way beneficiall to him of whom a reward in strict justice is demanded; ours are not so: forPsal. 16.2. our goodnesse extendeth not unto God, hee is farre above it. This naile SaintL 10. de civ. Dei, c 5. To∣tum hoc quod recte colitur, Deus creden∣dum est homi∣ni prodesse, non Deo, ne{que} enim fonti se quisquam dixe∣rit profuisse quod biberit. Austine excellently fasteneth: If we serve and worship God as wee ought, the whole benefit thereof accrueth to our selves, and not unto God: for no man will say that the fountaine gaineth any thing by our drinking of it, &c. Fourthly, a meritorious act must bee compleat, perfect, and without ex∣ception; ours are not so: forVide Plat. in dial. Euthyph. Rom. 8.26. wee cannot pray as wee ought, and our very best actions are so stained, that the Prophet Esay calleth them no better
thanEsay 64.6. But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righ∣teousnesse is as filthy ragges. filthy ragges or menstruous clouts. This arrow SaintMoral. in Job. l. 5. c. 7. Ipsa ju∣stitia nostra, si ad examen ju∣stitiae divinae deducatur, inju∣stitia est; & sordet in distri∣ctione judicis quod in aesti∣matione fulget operantis.Gregory drives to the head: Our very righteousnesse, if it bee scanned by the rule of divine ju∣stice, will prove injustice; and that will appeare foule and sordid in the strict scanning of the Judge, which shineth and seemeth most beautifull in the eye of the worker. Fiftly, a meritorious worke must hold some good correspondency and equivalence with the reward; ours doe not so: for if wee might offer to put any worke in the ballance, certainely our sufferings for Christs sake; but these are too light, yea so farre too light,Rom. 8.18. that they are not worthy to be com∣pared with the glory which shall bee revealed in us. Upon this anvile SaintIn ep. ad Col. Hom. 2. . Idem in psal. 4. . Chrysostome formeth a steele weapon; No man sheweth such a conversation of life that hee may bee worthy of the kingdome, but this is wholly of the gift of God; and although wee should doe innumerable good deeds, it is of Gods pity and mercy that wee are heard; although we should come to the very top of ver∣tue, it is of mercy that wee are saved: AndAnsel. de men∣surat. crucis. Si homo mille an∣nis serviret Deo ferventis∣simè, non me∣reretur ex con∣digno dimidi∣um diei esse in coelo. Anselme steepeth it in oyle; If a man should serve God most devoutly a thousand yeeres, hee should not de∣serve to be halfe a day in heaven. What have our adversaries to say to these things? what doth the learned Cardinall, whose name breathesBella, Arma, Minae. Warres, Armes, and Threats? here hee turnes Penelope, texit telam & retexit, hee does and undoes, hee sewes and ravels: after many large books written for merit, in the end Quae dederat repetit, funemque reducit; hee dasheth all with his pen at once, saying, Tutissimum est, it is the safest way to place all our confidence onely in Gods mercy, that is, to renounce all merit. Now in a case so neerely concerning our eternall happinesse or misery, hee that will not take the safest course, needs not to bee confuted, but either to bee pittied for his folly, or cured of his frenzie. To conclude this point of difference; the conclusion of all things is neere at hand: well may men argue with men here below the matter of merit, but, as St.Ep 29. Cum rex justus sede∣ret in throno suo, quis glori∣abitur se mun∣dum habere cor? quae igi∣tur spes veniae, nisi misericor∣dia superexul∣tet justitiam? Au∣stine feelingly speaketh of this point, When the righteous judge (from whose face heaven and earth fled away) shall sit upon his throne; who will then dare say my heart is cleane? nay what hope for any man to be saved, if mercy at that day get not the upper hand of justice? I need plead no more for this (Da∣bo) in my text; if it plead not for us at that day, wee shall never eat of the Manna promised, but it shall bee for ever hidden from us. I will give To eat. The sight of Manna, which the Psalmist calleth Angels food, es∣pecially of the hidden Manna, which by Gods appointment was reserved in a golden pot, had beene a singular favour; but the taste thereof is a farre greater. The contemplation of celestiall objects is delightfull, but the frui∣tion of them much more. Even of earthly beauties the sight is not so great contentment as the enjoying, neither is any man so affected with delight at the view of a rich cabinet of jewels, as at the receiving any one of them for his own. Now so it is in celestial treasures & delights; through Gods boun∣ty & abundant goodnesse unto us we own what we see, & we taste what we touch, and we feel what we believed, and we possesse what we have heard, and our heart entreth into those joyes in heaven, which never entred into
the heart of man on earth. In which respect the Psalmist breaketh out in∣to that passionate invitation;Psal. 34.8. O taste and see how gracious the Lord is: and S. Paul into that fervent prayer;Phil. 1.9. And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all sense, : and SaintConfes. l. 6. c. 10. Te lucem, vocem, cibum, & amplexum interioris ho∣minis mei, &c. ubi fulget ani∣mae quod non capit lo∣cus, & ubi so∣nat quod non rapit tempus, & ubi olet quod non spar∣git flatus, & u∣bi sapit quod non minuit e∣dacitas, & ubi haeret quod non divellit sa∣tietas. Austine in that heavenly meditation; O let mee enjoy thee, the light, the sound, the food, the love and embracement of my inward man; thou art light to the eye, musicke to the eare, sweet meats to the taste, and most delight∣full embracings to the touch of my soule: in thee that shineth to my soule which no place comprehendeth; and that soundeth which no time measureth, or snatch∣eth away; and that smelleth which no blast dissipateth; and that relisheth which no feeding upon diminisheth; and that adhereth which no satiety can plucke away. When therefore the ancients define celestiall happinesse to be the beatificall vision of God, grounding themselves especially upon these texts of scripture:Mat. 5.8. Psal. 27.8. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God, and seeke his face evermore. My heart said unto thee, thy face Lord will I seeke; and,Psal. 17.15. I will behold thy face in righteousnesse: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likenesse. And,1 Cor. 13.12 Now we see through a glasse, darkely, but then face to face; wee are to understand these speeches by a figure called Synecdo∣che, wherein a part is put for the whole: for certainely there is a heaven in the will and in the affections, as well as in the understanding. God hath en∣riched the soule with many faculties, and in all of them hath kindled mani∣fold desires; the heat whereof, though it may bee allayed for a time with the delights and comforts which this life affordeth, yet it can never bee quenched but by himselfe who made the hearth, and kindled these fires in it. As the contemplation of God is the understandings happinesse, so the adhering to him is the wils; the recounting of his blessings, the memories; the embracing him, the affections; and generally the fruition of him in all parts and faculties, the felicity of the whole man. To apply this observation to the words in my text: When the dispensers of the mysteries of salvati∣on open the scriptures, they set before us heavenly treasure, they point unto, and shew us the golden pots of Manna: but when by the hand of faith we receive Gods promises, and are enriched by the graces of the spirit, then we owne the pearles of the Gospell. To heare one who hath the tongue of the learned discourse of the worke of grace, enlightning the minde, regenera∣ting the heart, rectifying the will, moderating the desires, quieting the af∣fections, and filling the soule with unspeakable joy, is a great delight to us; yet nothing to that we take when we feele grace working upon our soules, and producing all these divine effects within us. When wee read in holy Scriptures what are the priviledges of the sonnes of God, wee see the hid∣den Manna; but when theRom. 8.16.17. Spirit testifieth to our spirit that wee are the sons of God; and if sonnes then heires, heires of God, and joint heires with Christ: then we eat The hidden Manna. Some take the hidden Manna in my text for the my∣steries of the Gospel, others for the secret vertues of the Sacraments.Primasius in Apoc. Christus factus est ho∣mo, ut panem Angelorum comederet ho∣mo. Pri∣masius for Christ himselfe, who, as he saith, was made man that man might eate Manna the food of Angels: Pererius for incomparable sweetnesse in the contemplation of heavenly things: Cornelius à Lapide for spirituall comforts after temptations: all in generall speake to good purpose. But if
you demand of me in particular, what is this hidden Manna; I must answer as Cato did when one asked him what he carried so fast lockt up in a chest: It is lockt up (saith he) that thou shouldest not looke into it nor know. I cannot tell you what it is, because it is hidden: onely this is open and mani∣fest in the Scriptures, that in the Word, the Sacraments, Prayer and Medi∣tation, the Elect of God find hidden Manna, that spirituall sweetnesse which may be compared unto, or rather preferred before the relish of Manna to the corporall taste. And what St. Cyprian speaketh of the worke of grace in our conversion, Sentitur priusquam dicitur, it is felt before it can be ut∣tered, may be applied to this hidden Manna, gustatur priusquam dicitur, no tongue can speake of it worthily that hath not tasted it: asPsal. 119.103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste  they are sweeter than hony to my mouth. David did, who preferreth it before the hony and the hony-combe. And St.Aug. confes. l. 9. c. 1. O quam suave mihi repentè fuit carere mundi suavi∣tatibus & quas amittere metus fuit am dimit∣tere gaudium crat: tu enim pros intraas omni volupta∣te dulcior. Austine, O what pleasure tooke I in abandoning all worldly pleasure! for thou, O Lord, enteredst into me for them sweeter than any pleasure. And St. Jerome, who calleth God to witnesse that sometimes he found heaven upon earth, and in his spirituall elevations and raptures thought that hee communed with quieres of Angels. And St.St. Eph. Do∣mine recede à me parumper, quia vasis in∣firmitas ferre non potest. Ephraim, who was so over-filled with joy in the Holy Ghost that he made a strange prayer; O Lord for a little while de∣part from me, and restraine the influence of spirituall joy, lest the vessell breake. And St.Mihi hae pru∣na rosae vi∣dentur. Citat Corneli∣us à lap Com∣ment. Tiburtius, whose inward joyes and spirituall raptures so drowned his bodily tortures, that when he trod upon live coales he cryed out, saying, These live coales seeme to me no other than red roses. The scholars of Pytha∣goras beleeved that the celestiall bodies by their regular motions caused an harmonicall sound, and made admirable musicke, though neither he nor a∣ny other ever heard it: and shall not we beleeve that there is hidden Man∣na, though we never tasted it, if not upon the report of these Saints who spake of their owne sense and experience, yet upon the credit of him who both promiseth to give this hidden Manna, and is it himselfe?John 6.51. I am the li∣ving bread which came downe from heaven. Christ and his word retaine not only the name of Manna, but the chiefe qualities and properties thereof. First, Manna rained from the skies; Christ and his word came from heaven. Secondly, Manna had a most sweet yet a new and strange taste, so hath the word; it is sweeter than hony to the spirituall tast, though the carnall man like better of the flesh pots of Egypt than of it. Thirdly, Manna relished according to the stomackes of them that ate it, and answered all appetites: so the word of God is milke to children, and strong meat to men. Fourthly, Manna erat cibus reficiens & nunquam deficiens, the children of Israel fed on Manna in the wildernesse till they entred into the earthly Canaan: in like manner the Word and Sacraments are our spirituall food till we arrive at the celestiall Canaan. Fiftly, Manna was eaten by it selfe without any other meat or sauce ad∣ded to it: the word of God must not be mingled with human traditions and inventions. They who goe about to sweeten it with such spices marre the tast of it, and may more justly be taxed than that King of Persia was by Antalcidas, who by pouring oyntment upon a garland of roses corrupted
the naturall smell and fragrancie thereof by the adulterors sophistication of art. Sixtly, some portion of the Manna was laid up in the Arke, and kept in a golden pot for after-times; and part of the mysteries of holy Scripture are reserved for us till we come to heaven: and in regard of such truthes as are not ordinarily revealed in this life, some conceive the word to be here ter∣med Hidden Manna. Howbeit, we need not restraine the words to those ab∣struse mysteries, the declaration whereof shall be a part of our celestiall hap∣pinesse: for the whole doctrine of the Gospell may in a true sense be called hidden Manna, because it containeth in it Sapientiam Dei in mysterio, the wisedome of God1 Cor. 2.7. hidden in a mysterie. For albeit the sound of the word is gone into all the world, yet the harmonie in it is not observed by all. The chapters and verses of the Scripture are generally knowne, but not all the contents. He that saw the outside of Solomons tents could not ghesse at the royaltie of that Prince: but he that entred in, and took a particular view and inventory of his pretious furniture, rich hangings, massie plate, full coffers, orient jewels, and glittering apparell, might make a good estimate thereof. A blind man from his birth, though he may heare of the Sun, and discourse of his golden raies from the mouth of others, yet can he not possibly conceive what delight the seeing eye taketh in beholding that glorious brouch of heaven, and Prince of the starres. When we heare the last will of a rich man read unto us, which we beleeve little concerneth us, though it be never so well penned or copied out, it little affecteth us: but if we have certaine notice that by it some great legacie in lands or money is bequeathed unto us, then we hearken to it with thirsty eares, and as curiously observe every line and sillable therein as Jewellers doe every carrat in a Diamond. Such is the difference betweene the carnall and the spirituall mans apprehension and affection in the reading and hearing of the written word: the letters and points are not hidden to any that can reade, but the treasures of wise∣dome and knowledge laid up in it, the power and efficacy of it, the price and value of it is hidden to all thoseActs 16.14. whose heart God openeth not as he did the heart of Lidia. And if the Manna of the word be thus hidden, how much more the Manna of the Spirit, I meane the inward comforts and joyes of the1 Pet. 3.4. bidden man of the heart?Plutarch. de tranquil. animae , Diogenes the Philosopher bid every day ho∣ly in a good mans calendar: turne Diogenes his good man into a regenerate Christian, and his Philosophy will prove good Divinity. For to a sanctified soule every day is holy, on which he keepeth a great feast, thePro. 15.15. feast of a good conscience; at which the principal service is the hidden Manna in my text.

Enna in Sicily there is a continuall spring, and flowers all the yeere: so are there in the mind of a faithfull Christian, it is spring there all the yeere: and though he hath not alwayes the sense and smelling, because sometimes his spirituall nostrils are stuffed with earthly cares and worldly comforts, yet he hath alwaies within him the sent of the flowers of Para∣dise. I grant there is a time to rejoyce, and a time also to weepe: and I ac∣knowledge that the devoutest man upon earth, who is most ravished with divine contemplation, yet doth not alwayes actually rejoyce, that is, appre∣hend or expresse his joy: yet as St.Pros. de vit. contemplat. l. 1. Non potest de∣fraudari dele∣ctationibus cui Christus est gaudium, quia bono delecta∣tur aeterno. Prosper soundly argueth, He can never
be without joy and comfort, whose joy is Christ, because the fuell of this sacred flame is eternall. Though the earth be sometimes, as now it is beyond the seas, full of darknesse and cruell habitations, yet there is stillPsal. 97.11. Light is sowne for the righte∣ous, & gladness for the upright in heart. light in Go∣shen, in the conscience of a righteous man. Light is as it were the joy of the skie, and joy is the light of the minde: now as lights, so joyes are of two sorts: 1 Purer and finer: 2 Impurer and grosser. The purer lights burne clearer, last longer, and leave a sweeter savour behinde them: the grosser and impurer burne dimly, spend fast, running into gutters, and goe out with an ill favour. You may observe the like dif∣ference betweene carnall and spirituall joyes; carnall delights that are fed with impure matter, such as are the lusts of the flesh, and the lusts of the eye, 1. Burne dimly, they yeeld no cleere light of comfort to the minde, they are mixed joyes, and insincere; Medio de fonte leporum surgit amarum aliquid. 2. They spend fast, and are quickly over. Seneca rightly observeth,Voluptas cum accenditur extinguitur. I∣ta quibus dele∣ctatur vulgus, tennem habent ac perfusoriam voluptatem, & quodeun{que} in∣vectitium gau∣dium est, fun∣damento caret. Sen. ep. 23. In praecipiti est vo∣luptas, ad dolo∣rem vergit, nisi modum teneat. That pleasure is quenched in the kindling of it, much like dry thorns under a pot, which make a blaze, & sodainly are turned into ashes. In which regard the Romans set up the image of Angerona the goddesse of anguish and sor∣row, in the Temple of Volupia, the Goddesse of pleasure, to shew that pain treadeth upon the heele of pleasure, and anguish of mirth. 3. They goe out with a stinke; they leave behinde them amara & foe∣da vestigia, as Saint Bernard speaketh, a bitter fume, and noysome stench in our consciences, and a foule print upon our name. But spirituall joyes on the contrary, 1. Burne clearely, send forth a bright flame; for these joyes are sin∣cere, exceeding unspeakable and glorious. 2. They last long; for they are, as Saint Austine calleth them,Sen. ep. 23. Hoc ad quod te co∣nor perducere, solidum est, & quod plus pa∣teat introrsus, &c. fortes delitiae, & solida gaudia, during delights, and solid joyes. 3. They leave a sweet savour behind them; a good report in the world, and a sweet contentment in the soule. For they are SolomonsPro. 16.24. Dulcedo a∣nimae, DavidsPsal. 45.7. Oleum laetitiae, Saint Pauls2 Cor. 2.16. Odor suavitatis, and S. Johns Manna reconditum, sweet to the soule, and health to the bones, the oyle of gladnesse, the savour of life, the hidden Manna: O felix & paucis nota vo∣luptas! The world is all set upon a merry pinne, though God knowes there is little cause; we are all for pleasure, but it is a paine to a righteous soule to thinke what pleasure, it is griefe to name what joy. In Pontus there is a flower called Rodo-dendrum, of which the honey that is made is rank poy∣son; such is the sensuall delight that is taken in the use, or rather the abuse of worldly pleasures; it distempereth the taste, and poysoneth the soule. Not to forsake the Metaphor in my text; all inordinate pleasures, immode∣rate joyes, and impure delights are like the Manna that was gathered on the Sabbath day, which corrupted suddenly, and became full of wormes: but pure and spirituall joyes are like that Manna, which Moses by Gods ap∣pointment laid up in a golden pot, which corrupted not, but preserved it selfe from putrefaction, and the gold also from rust; the lid or cover of
which pot I will endevour to open a little wider, that you may have yet a fuller sight and quicker taste of the hidden Manna. There are three kindes of the hidden Manna: 1 Of the Word: 2 Of the Sacrament: 3 Of the Spirit. 1 The Manna of the Word is that delight which is taken by the hea∣rers in the opening the mysteries of holy Scripture, and applying the sweet comforts of the Gospell to the conscience: and thisEp. ad Hier. Damasus conceived to be the greatest happinesse in the world. 2. The Manna of the Sacrament is that comfort which the worthy re∣ceivers feele in themselves, after the sanctified use of the elements, by growth in grace, and increase of spirituall strength: and of this SaintEp. l. 2. Cy∣prian was as it were in travell, till hee was delivered of it in his Epistle to Cornelius. 3. The Manna of the Spirit is that unspeakable joy, wherewith the heart is filled, and even leapeth and danceth within us, when wee heare the Spirit testifying unto our spirits that wee are the sonnes of God. Pretious metals are digged out of the bowels of the earth, and pearles are found in the bot∣tome of the sea; and truely seldome shall we fall upon this treasure of spiri∣tuall joy, and pearle of the Gospell, but in the depth of godly sorrow, and bottome and lowest point of our humiliation before God. 1. The first taste wee have of the hidden Manna of the Spirit, is in the beginning of our conversion, and nonage of our spirituall life; when after unutterable remorse, sorrow, and feare, arising from the apprehensi∣on of the corruption, and guilt of our naturall estate, and a dreadfull expe∣ctation of wrath laid up for us against the day of wrath, and everlasting weeping, howling, and gnashing of teeth with the damned in hell; wee on the suddaine see a glympse of Gods countenance shining on us, and by faith, though yet weake, hope for a perfect reconciliation to him. 2. A second taste wee have, when wee sensibly perceive the Spirit of grace working upon our heart, thawing it, as it were, and melting it into godly sorrow, and after enflaming it with an everlasting love of him, who by his infinite torments and unconceivable sorrowes, hath purchased unto us eternall joyes. 3. A third taste wee have of it, when after a long fight with our naturall corruptions, wee meet with the Divels Lievtenant, the sinne that reigneth in us, which the Scripture calleth the plague of the heart; that vice to which either the temper of our body, or our age, or condition of life enclineth us unto; our bosome abomination, to which for a long time wee have en∣thralled our selves, and having perfectly discovered it by employing the whole armour of God against it, in the end wee get the victory of it. 4. A fourth taste wee have after some heavie crosse, or long sicknesse, when God delivereth us above hope, and sanctifieth our affliction unto us, and by his Spirit calleth to our remembrance all his goodnesse to us from our childhood, and anointeth our eyes with eye-salve, that wee may see the
manifold fruits of the crosse, and finde in our selves with David, that it was good for us thus to bee afflicted. 5. A fift taste wee have at some extafie in our life, or a trance at our death, when wee are rapt up, as it were, into the third heaven with St. Paul, and see those things that eye never saw, and heare words that cannot be uttered. Thus have I opened unto you five springs of the waters of com∣fort; in which after you have stript your selves of wordly cares, and earth∣ly delights, you may bathe your soules: in the bottome whereof you may see the white stone, which Christ promiseth to him that over∣commeth, saying, To him that overcommeth I will give to eate of the hidden Manna: To whom, &c.
THE WHITE STONE. THE XXVII. SERMON. APOC. 2.17. And I will give him a white stone. Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. IT was the manner of the Thracians to reckon up all the happy dayes of their life, and marke them in a booke or table with a white stone: whereunto the Poet allu∣ding saith, Pers. satyr.Hunc Macrine diem numera meliore lapillo. May it please God by his Spirit to imprint those mysteries in your hearts, which are engraven upon this stone, I doubt not but this day, in which I am to describe unto you the nature of it, will prove so happy, that it shall deserve to bee scored up with the like stone. For this white stone is a certaine token and pledge of present remission of sinnes, and future admission into Christs kingdome. Whereof through divine assi∣stance, by your wonted patience, I will speake at large; after I have refre∣shed the characters in your memory of my former observations upon this Scripture, which setteth before all that overcome in the threefold chri∣stian warre, 1 Forraine, against Sathan.Recapitulat. 2 Civill, against the world. 3 Servile, against fleshly lusts; three boones or speciall gifts:
1 Hidden Manna, a type of spirituall consolation. 2 A white stone, the embleme of justification. 3 A new name, the imprese of glorification. There is 1 Sweetnesse in the hidden Manna. 2 Comfort in the white stone. 3 Glory in the new name. The sweetnesse of the hidden Manna wee tasted, 1 In the mysticall meaning of the Word. 2 In the secret power of the Sacrament. 3 In the unutterable comfort of the Spirit. And now I am to de∣liver unto you in the next place the white stone. In the handling whereof, I will levell at those three scientificall questi∣ons mentioned byAristot. ana∣lyt. post l. 2. c. 1. . Notand quod sit referti ad an sit, ubi de acci∣dente quaeri∣tur, quia acci∣dentis esse est messe. Aristotle in his bookes of demonstration. Divis., An sit, aut quod sit. , Quid sit. , Propter quod sit. First, whether there be any such white stone. Secondly, what it is. Thirdly, to what end it is given, and what use wee are to make of it for our instruction, correction, or comfort. First, of the An sit, , whether there be any such stone or no. There hath beene for many ages, a great question De lapide Philosophico, of the Philosophers stone, to which they ascribe a rare vertue to turne baser metals into gold: but there is no question at all among the sincere profes∣sours of the Gospell, De lapide theologico, of the divine stone in my text, which yet is far more worth, and of greater vertue than that. For that (if we have any faith in Alchymy) after much labour, and infinite cost, will turne base metall into gold; but this will undoubtedly turne penitent teares into pearle, and drops of blood shed for the testimony of the Gospell, into ru∣bies and hematites to beset our crowne of glory. With this stone, as a spe∣ciall love-token, Christ assureth his dearest spouse, thatRom. 8.28. all things shall turn to her good, and worke together for her endlesse happinesse. Hee that hath this white stone, shall by the eye of faith see it suddenly turne all temporall losses into spirituall advantages, all crosses into blessings, all afflictions into comforts. What though some heretickes or profane persons have no be∣liefe of this white stone, no more than they have of thatMat. 13.46. pearle of great price, which the Merchant sold all that hee had to buy? What though some have beene abused by counterfeit stones like to this? shall wee not therefore re∣gard this, or seeke after it? This were all one as if an expert Gold-smith should refuse to look after pure gold, because some ignorant Merchant hath beene cheated with sophisticated alchymie stuffe for gold: or if a skilfull Jeweller should offer nothing for an orient Diamond, because an unskilfull
Lapidary hath beene corisened with a Cornish or Bristow stone in stead of it. The mistaking of any other man should not take off the edge of our de∣sires to gaine an invaluable jewell, but whet our diligence the more, to ob∣serve more accurately the notes of difference betweene the true and coun∣terfeit stone, upon which I shall touch anon, after I have convinced our Romish sceptickes, by evidence from the nature of faith, the profession of Gods Saints, the testimony of the Spirit, and undeniable signes and effects, that all that are called by the word effectually, have this white stone in my text given unto them, whereby they are assured of their present estate of grace, and future of glory. The faith of GodsTit. 1.1. Elect is not a bare assent to supernaturall verities re∣vealed in Scripture, which may bee in a Reprobate, and is in theJam. 2.19. Devils themselves: Thou beleevest there is one God, thou doest well, the Devils also beleeve and tremble: but a divine grace, whereby being fully assured of Gods favour to us, wee trust him with our soules, and wholly rely on him for salvation, through the merits of his sonne. The sure promises of the Gospell are like a strong cable, let downe to a man in a deepe pit or dunge∣on, on which hee doth not onely lay hand by faith, but hangeth and resteth himselfe upon it, and thereby is drawne out of darkenesse, to see and pos∣sesse the inheritance of the Saints in light. To beleeve the communion of Saints, is not onely to bee perswaded that there is a communion of Saints in the world, remission of sinnes in the Church, resurrection of the flesh at the last day, and life everlasting in heaven: but to bee assured by faith, that wee have an interest in this communion, benefit by this remission, and shall partake the glory of this resurrection, and the happinesse of life everla∣sting. They who had beene stung by fiery serpents, and were healed by looking upon the brazen serpent, did not onely beleeve that it had cured many, but that it would cure them. Here the Logicians rule holdeth, Me∣dicina curat Socratem, non hominem; physicke is not given to mans nature to cure the species, but to every man in individuo to heale his person: and to every sicke soule that applieth unto it selfe the promises of the Gospell, Christ saith,Mat. 9.22.29 Bee it unto thee as thou beleevest, thy faith hath made thee whole, goe in peace. Hereupon SaintFides dicit; aeternabona re∣posita sunt; spes dicit, mi∣hi teposita sunt; charitas dicit, ego curro post ea. Bernard bringeth in the three divine graces, Faith, Hope, and Charity, singing as it were a catch, and taking the word one from another; Faith beginneth, saying, everlasting treasures are layd up in heaven; Hope followeth, saying, they are layd up for mee; Chari∣ty concludeth, I will seeke after them. And verily no man by a generall Ro∣mish credulity, but by a speciall faith in Christ, can say with Job, My re∣deemer; with David, My salvation; with the Spouse, My beloved, with the blessed Virgin, My Saviour; with Thomas, My Lord and my God: much lesse can hee warrant these possessives with a scio;Job 19.25.26.27. I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that I shall see him stand up at the last day upon the earth: and though after my skinne, wormes destroy this body, yet in my flesh I shall see God: whom I shall see for my selfe. And,Psal. 45.11.12. I know that thou favourest me, thou upholdest mee in my integrity, and fettest me before thy face for ever. And,Rom. 8.28. Wee know that all things worke for the best to them that love God. We know that when2 Cor. 5.1. our earthly tabernacle is dissolved, wee shall have an eternall in the heavens.1 Joh. 2.5. Wee know that wee are translated from death to life, because we
love the brethren. Opinion and science, a conjecturall hope and an as∣sured beliefe, as much differ as a shaken reed and a well growne oake, which no winde can stirre. To know any thing, saithL. 1 posterior c. 2. Scire est causam rei cog∣noscere, & quod illius cau∣sa sit, & quod res illa aliter se habere non posset. Aristotle, is to know the cause, and that this cause is the cause of such an effect, and that the thing it selfe cannot bee other∣wise than wee conceive of it: in which regard the Greeke Etymologist de∣riveth , because opinion waggeth and inclineth the mind by probabilities on both sides; but science fasteneth it, and maketh it stand unmoveable. With these texts of scripture, attributing knowledge of salvation to all be∣leevers, our Trent Merchants are manifestly gravelled, and sticke in the mud: yet they endevour to boye up their sunke vessell by a distinction of a double knowledge, 1 By common faith. 2 By speciall revelation. They yeeld that some, who have been admitted to Gods privie Councell by speciall revelation, have been assured of their crowne of glory; but they will by no meanes grant that beleevers can attain to this certainty by their common faith: yet such is the clearnesse of the texts above alledged, for the point in question, that they easily, like the beames of the sunne, breake through this popish mist. For Job speaketh not of any speciall secret revea∣led unto him, but of the common article of all our faith, concerning the re∣surrection of the flesh; I know that my Redeemer liveth, and hee shall stand up, and I shall see him with these eyes. And what David speaketh of his knowledge of Gods favour, and stedfast beliefe of his future happinesse,Ad Monim. l. 1. ustus ex fide vivens, fiducia∣liter dicit, cre∣do videre bona domini in ter∣ra viventium. Fulgentius applyeth to every beleever; The just man living by faith, spea∣keth confidently, I beleeve that I shall see the goodnesse of the Lord in the land of the living. And S. John ascribeth this knowledge, not to any singular reve∣lation, but to charity, the common effect of faith: We know that we are passed from death to life, because we love the brethren: whereupon S.Tract. 5. in ep. Joh. Nemo interroget ho∣minem, redeat ad cor suum, si ibi invenerit charitatem, se∣curus sit, quia transiit à mor∣te ad vitam. Austin giveth this sage advice; Let no man enquire of man, let him have recourse to his owne heart; if he find there charity, let him rest assured that he is passed from death to life. And S. Paul joyneth all the faithfull with him, saying, We know that all things worke for the best to them that love God: and, There is layd up a crown of righteousnesse, which the righteous Judge shall give mee at that day, and not to mee onely, but to all them also that love his appearing. In like manner SaintEp. ex regist. l. 6. Hac fulti certitudine, de ejusdem re∣demptoris no∣stri misericor∣diá nihil ambi∣gere, sed spe debemus indu∣bitatâ praesu∣mere. Gregory impropriateth not this assurance to himselfe, or some few to whom God extraordinarily revealeth their state hereafter, but extendeth it to all, making it a common duty, not a speciall gift; saying, Being supported with this certainty, wee ought nothing to doubt of the mercy of our Redeemer, but bee confident thereof, out of an assured hope. By the coherence of the text in the eighth to the Romans, we may infallibly gather, that all that walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, and have received the first fruits there∣of, and the testimony within themselves, are the Sonnes of God, know that all things worke together for their good. Have wee not all received the spirit of adoption? doe we not come to God as children to a most loving father? doe wee not daily, in confidence of his love, cry, Abba Father? If so, then
the Apostle addeth farther, that the Spirit testifieth to our spirit, that we are the sonnes of God. And lest any hereticall doubt cast in might trouble the spring of everlasting comfort, as if we were indeed made sonnes for the pre∣sent, but might forfeit our adoption, and thereby lose our inheritance, the Apostle cleareth all in the words following (v. 17.) If sonnes, then heires, heires of God, and joynt heires with Christ. God adopteth no sonne whom he intendeth not to make his heire, neither can any that is borne of him cease to be his sonne, because the1 Pet. 1.23. Being borne a∣gaine, not of corruptible seed, but of in∣corruptible. seed of which he is borne is incorruptible, and this seed still remaineth in him. 1 John 3.9. Whosoever is borne of God doth not commit sinne, for his seed remaineth in him. There are three means of assurance among men: 1 Earnests. 2 Seales. 3 Witnesses. In bargaines earnests, in deeds seales, in trialls witnesses. First, to secure summes of money or bargaines we take earnests of men, or some pledge: behold this security given us by God, even the2 Cor. 1.22. earnest of his Spirit in our hearts. On which words St.Chrysost. in secund. ad Cor. hom. l. 3. . Chrysostome thus plainely glosseth, He saith not the Spirit, but the earnest of the Spirit, that thou mayst be every way confident: for if he meant not to give thee the whole, he would never have given this earnest in present. For this had beene to lose his earnest, and cast it away in vaine. Secondly, to confirme all grants, licences, bonds, leases, testaments and conveyances, seales are required: behold this confirmation also, Ephes. 1.13. In whom ye are sealed by that holy Spirit of promise. and 4.30. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed to the day of redemp∣tion. Whether we speake of the seale sealing, or the seale sealed, we have both. For we are sealed by the Spirit of grace as by the seale sealing, and by the grace of the Spirit as the seale sealed, that is, printed upon us. In reference to which place DanielChamierus de fid. l. 10. c. 13. Sigillorum varii sunt gradus: a∣lia simpliciter ad rei pertinent certitudinem indefinité; sic Reges sigillis suis muniunt diplomata, sic contrahentes sigillis sche∣dam suam mu∣niunt: sed alia spectant perso∣nae certitudi∣nem quae obsig∣nari dicitur, id est, signo pecu∣liari insigniri, ut eo sciat se in numerum eo∣rum ascriptum ad quos tale aliquod jus pertinet, ut cum Rex Equitibus suis torques concedit, ut procerto habeat se Equites esse. Chamierus rightly noteth, that there are seales put to things for their confirmation, and certaine signes or badges an∣swerable to seales given to persons at their investiture, as a collar of S's, and a blew ribbon, with a George, to the knights of the Garter, &c. We have both these seales, sigillum rei by the Sacrament, and sigillum personae by the Spirit, which sealeth us to the day of our redemption. Thirdly, to prove any matter of fact in Courts of justice, witnesses are produced: behold this proofe of our right and title to a kingdome in hea∣ven; proofe (I say) by witnesses beyond exception, the holy Spirit and our renewed consciences: The Spirit it selfe beareth witnesse with our Spirit, that wee are the children of God, Rom. 8.16. On which words St. Chrysostome thus enlargeth himselfe,Chrysost in epist. ad Rom. c. 8. . If a man, or an Angel, or an Archangel had pro∣mised thee this honour to be the Sonne of God, thou mightest peradventure have made some doubt of it: but now when God himselfe giveth thee this ti∣tle,
commanding thee to call him Abba, Father, who dare question thy title? If the King himselfe pricke a Sheriffe, or send him the Garter, or the Seale, what subject dare gainesay it? Lastly, as the Planets are knowne by their influence, and the Diamond by his lustre, and the Balsamum by his medicinall vertue, and the soule by her vitall operations: so the gift here promised is most sensibly knowne by the effects: 1 Exceeding love. 2 Secure peace. 3 Unspeakable joy. 4 Invincible courage. He that is not certain that he hath or ever shall receive any benefit by ano∣ther, or comfort in him, loveth but a little. He that was condemned to die, and cannot tell whether he hath a pardon for his life or no, can be at no peace: he that heareth glad tidings, but giveth little credit to them, rejoy∣ceth but faintly: he who hath no assurance of a better life, will be advised how he parteth with this. But the Saints of God and Martyrs of Jesus Christ are exceedingly enflamed with the love of their Redeemer, in com∣parison whereof they esteeme all things as dung: they enjoy peace that pas∣seth all understanding, they are ravished with spirituall joy, they so little passe for this present life, that they are ready not onely to be bound but to dye for the Lord Jesu; they rejoyce in their sufferings, they sing in the middest of the flames, they lie as contentedly upon the racke as upon a bed of doune, they prove masteries with all sorts of evill, they weary both tor∣tures and tormentors, and in all are more than Conquerours: therefore they know assuredly how they stand in the Court of heaven; they feele within them what Christ hath done for them; they have received already the first fruits of heavenly joyes, and doubt not of the whole crop; they haue re∣ceived the earnest, and doubt not of their full pay; they have received the seales, and doubt not of the deeds of their salvation; they have received the testimonie of the Spirit, and doubt not of their adoption; they have re∣ceived the white stone in my text, and doubt not of their absolution from death, and election to a kingdome in heaven. What doe their dying speeches, that ought to live in perpetuall memory, import lesse? First St.2 Tim. 4.6, 7, 8. Pauls: I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth is laid up for me a crowne of righte∣ousnesse, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give mee at that day. Secondly ofHieron. l. de viris illustribus. Utinam fiuar bestus quae mi∣hi praeparatae sunt, quas & oro veloces mihi esse ad interitum, & alliciam ad comedendum me, ne sicut & aliorum Mar∣tyrum non audeant corpus attingere. Quod si venire noluerint, ego vim faciam ut devorar. Ignoscite mihi filioli, quid mihi profit ego scio, nunc incipio esse Discipulus Christi: nihil de iis quae videntur desiderans, ut Jesum Chri∣stum inveniam; ignis, crux, bestiae, confractio ossium, membrorum{que} divisio, & totius corporis contritio, & omnia tormenta Diaboli in me veniant, tantum ut Christo fruar; & cum ardore pascendi rugientes audiret leones, ait fru∣mentum Christi sum, dentibus bestiarum molar, ut panis mundus inveniar. Ignatius. When he heard the Lions roare for hunger, to whom he was suddenly to be cast as a prey: O that I were with the beasts that are prepared for me, whom I desire quickly to make an end of me: if they
refuse to touch my body (as through feare they have abstained from the bodies of other Saints) I will urge and provoke them to fall upon mee: Pardon me, children, I know what is good for mee, now I begin to bee Christs disciple, de∣siring none of those things which are seene: that I may finde Jesus Christ, wel∣come fire, crosse, beasts, teeth, breaking of my bones, tearing asunder of my members, grinding to powder of my whole body; let all the torments which the Devill can devise come upon mee, to the end, or so that I may enjoy Jesus my love. I am Christs corne, and presently I shall bee ground with the teeth of wilde beasts, that I may bee served in as fine manchet at my Lords table. Thirdly, of Babylas: Returne to thy rest, O my soule, for the Lord hath re∣warded thee: I shall now walke before the Lord in the land of the living. Fourthly, of Constantine the great:Euseb. de vit. Constant. l. 4. c. 6. . Now I know my selfe to bee truely happy, I have now attained the true light, and none but my selfe understandeth, or can apprehend what happinesse I am made partaker of. Fiftly, of SaintBernardus moriens dixit, Duplici jure retinet Domi∣nus meus reg∣num coelorum, haereditate pa∣tris, & merito passionis; alte∣ro ipse conten∣tus, alterum mihi donavit. Author. vit. Bern. l. 1. c. 22. Bernard: My Lord hath a double right to the kingdome of heaven; by inheritance, and by purchase; by inheritance of his Father, and purchase of his owne blood: with the former right himselfe is contented, the lat∣ter he hath given unto me: I am not worthy, I confesse, neither can I by mine owne merits obtaine the kingdome of heaven, but rest upon that interest which I have in the merit of Christs passion. Sixtly, of Luther:Vit. Luther. Receive my soule, Lord Jesu; though I bee taken from this life, and this body of mine bee layd downe, yet I know certainely that I shall remaine with thee for ever, neither shall any bee able to pull mee out of thy hand. Seventhly, of Juel:Humfred. in vitâ Juelli. A crowne of righteousnesse is layd up for me; Christ is my righteousnesse, this is my day, this day let mee quickly come unto thee, this day let mee see thee Lord Jesu. You have heard what wee are to say in answer to the first question, An sit? whether there be any such white stone? The second scientificall que∣stion is, Quid sit? what this white stone is? And because the Logicians di∣stinguish of, 1 Quid nominis. 2 Quid rei: the quiddity, as they speak, of the name and of the thing: First, I will declare the Quid nominis, what the word signifieth, or to what the metaphor alludeth; Nam de hoc calculo varii sunt Doctorum calculi. Although all who have brought sweet lights to illustrate this dark prophesie, make it very cleare that the white stone is a Metaphor, and the gift a mystery; yet as Manna is said to have rellished according to the seve∣rall appetites of them that had eaten it, so this white stone in the mysticall signification appeareth divers to each Interpreters fancy: and though a white stone, even in the bottome of a river, may easily be discerned; yet not when the water is troubled, as here it is. Some by it understand corpus glorificatum, a glorified body: and therein note foure properties, 1 Solidity. 2 Candour. 3 Rotundity. 4 Splendour.
The solidity in the white stone, say they, representeth the impassibility: the candour, the clarity and beauty: the roundnesse, the agility: the lustre or splendour, the subtility and glory of the Saints bodies raised from the dust. ThusAquin. in Caten. Aquinas, who taketh his hint from Rupertus, and hee from Beda. Others understand by the white stone, the grace of the spirit, which re∣neweth our mindes, making them pure and white, that is, innocent before God: soJunius in A∣poc. Gratiam spiritus quae imbuit novis moribus, & mentes puras & candidas, id est, innocentes reddit coram Deo. Junius, Aretius, Chytreus, Piscator, and Mathesius. Others interpret claritatem nominis, an illustrious name, or the honour and title of a conquerour; either because, asSextus Sen. bib. sanct. Cal∣culo albo prae∣notabantur, quo à caeteris discernerentur. Sixtus Senensis noteth, the dayes in which the Romanes gained any signall victory, were entred into their Fasti or registers with a white stone: or because they who overcame, and had the better in the Olympicke games or races, received for their guerdon aAretas in A∣poc . white shining stone. Veg. in Apoc. Deus per Chri∣sti opera, seu calculos com∣putatorios, om∣nium hominū rationem sub∣ducit.Vegus goeth a way by himselfe, taking this white stone for a white coun∣ter, and yeeldeth this reason of his interpretation: Because God, saith hee, casteth all mens salvation by Christs workes and merits; and all that hope to cleare with him for the infinite debts of their sinnes, must reckon upon them, or else they will fall short in their accounts. Behold Saul prophesieth, Balaam blesseth, and a Jesuite delivereth Protestant doctrine. Coment. in Apoc.Primasius and Victorinus will have this white stone to be alba gea, a white gemme, or glistering jewell or pearle, like that in the Gospell, which the rich Merchant man sold all that he had to buy: but the word in the o∣riginall is not , or , but , a stone used in  in giving sentences, or making decrees. The Judges among the Romanes, when they acquitted any man, cast in a white stone into an urne or pot, according to that of the Poet: Mos erat antiquis niveis atris{que} lapillis, His damnare reos, illis absolvere culpâ. And likewise the Citizens of Rome in choosing their Magistrates, wrote his name to whom they gave their voice, in a white stone. By allusion to which two customes, I conceive the Spirit in this place promiseth to every one that shall overcome the lusts of the flesh, by the Spirit; the assaults of the Devill, by faith; and the persecutions and troubles of the world, by his constancy, calculum absolutorium, & suffragatorium, an infallible token of his absolution from death, and election to a crowne of life; an assurance of present justification, and future glorification. Thus I take the Quid nominis to bee cleare: the greatest controversie is about the Quid rei; what that gift or grace is; what that signe or token, what that proofe or testimony, whereby our present estate of grace, and future of glory are secured unto us. Some ghesse not farre off the truth; That it is testimonium renovatae con∣scientiae, the testimony of a renewed conscience. For as the eye in a glasse by reflection seeth it selfe looking; so the conscience by a reflection upon it selfe, knoweth that it knoweth God, and beleeveth that it beleeveth in Christ, and feeleth that it hath a new feeling, sense, and life. The eye of
faith in the regenerate seeth himselfe sealed to the day of redemption, and observeth the print of the seale in himselfe, and the image of the heavenly which it beareth. I shall speake nothing to disparage this testimony of con∣science, which affordeth to every true beleever singular contentment in life, and comfort in death. The nearer the voice is, the briefer and more certainely wee heare it; and therefore wee cannot but distinctly take that deposition for us, which conscience speaketh in the eare of the heart. And yet wee have a nearer and surer voice to settle our heart in the knowledge of our spirituall estate, the testimony of Gods Spirit, which is nearer and more inward to our soules, than our soules to our bodies: and the witnesse there∣of may be as great, or a greater joy to us, than if God had sent an Angell to us, as hee did to Daniel, to shew unto us that wee were beloved of him: or an Archangel, as hee did to the VirginLuke 1.28. Mary, to salute us, Haile thou that art highly favoured of God. If any demand, as shee did, not out of any doubt, but out of a desire of farther information, quomodo? that is, how doth the Spirit testifie to our spirits that we are the sonnes of God? To speake nothing of elevations of Spirit, and raptures, and speciall reve∣lations, which are not now so frequent, and so certaine as in former ages; I answer, The Spirit testifieth this unto us two manner of wayes, by Motions, or Words. Effects, or Deeds. By words; so are the expresse words of SaintProlog card. vert. 1. Dicun∣tur tibi verba quaedam arca∣na intrinse∣cus, ut dubitare non possis quin juxta te fit. Cyprian, As when light∣ning breaketh the cloud, and the suddaine splendour thereof doth not so much enlighten as dazle the eyes: so sometimes thou art touched with I know not what motion, and feelest thy selfe to bee touched, and yet seest not him that tou∣cheth thee; there are inwardly spoken unto thee certaine secret words, so as thou canst not doubt that hee is neare thee, even within thee, who doth soli∣cite thee; yet doth hee not let thee see him as hee is. These secret words SaintSerm. 1. in annunc Hoc est testimoni∣um quod per∣hibet Spiritus sanctus, dimis∣sa sunt tibi pec∣cata tua. Bernard uttereth, This is the testimony or record which the Spirit beareth unto thee; Thy sinnes are forgiven thee. I take it the meaning of the words of these Fathers is not that the holy Ghost doth sound these formall words in our bodily eares, but that as God once1 Kin. 19.12 spake in a still small voice, so in it still hee speaketh to the faithfull, by the Spirit, verbis mentalibus, by men∣tall words or notions: by which hee continually inciteth us to good, re∣straines us from evill, forewarneth us of danger, and comforteth us in trou∣ble. And whilest wee listen to these notions, or rather motions of the spi∣rit within us, wee heare this testimony often and distinctly. But when wee give eare to the motions of the evill Spirit, and entertaine him, and delight in his society, and thereby grieve and despite the Spirit of grace; hee be∣ing thus grieved by us, speaketh no more words of comfort in us, but withdrawes his gracious presence, and leaveth us in horrour of conscience, and darknesse of minde. In this time of spirituall desertion, wee thinke wee have lost this white stone, though indeed wee have not lost it, but it is hid from us for a while: for afterwards wee shall finde it, having first felt the Spirit moving upon the waters of our penitent teares; and in our powring out our soules before God, assisting us with sighes and groanes that cannot be expressed: then after we renewing our covenant with him, our sins are
blowne away like a thicke mist: and light from heaven breaketh in againe upon us, and with this light assurance, and with assurance peace, and with peace joy in the holy Ghost. Yea, but a weake Christian may yet demand, How may I bee assured that my stone is not a counterfeit? that my gold is not alchymy? that my pearle is not glasse? that my Edenis not a fooles Paradise? that this testi∣mony in my soule is not a suggestion of Sathan to tempt mee to presumpti∣on, and thereby drowne mee in perdition? The Spirit of God commanding mee to1 Joh. 4.1. Beleeve not e∣very spirit, but try the spirit whether they are of God. Try the Spirits whether they are of God or no, implyeth that there are Spirits which are not of God: how then may I certainly know that this motion within mee is from the good, and not rather from the evill Spirit? By this, if it accord with the word, and the testimony of thine own conscience: but if it vary from either, thou hast just cause to suspect it. If any Spirit shall tell thee that thou art lockt in the armes of Gods mercy, and canst not fall from him, though thou huggest some vice in thy bosome, and lettest loose the reines to some evill concupiscence; give that Spirit the lye, because it accordeth not with the word of God, testifying expressely, thatEph. 5.5. no whoremonger, nor uncleane person, nor covetous man, which it an I∣dolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdome of God, and of Christ. For the grace of God that bringeth salvation, hath appeared unto all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. Againe, if any Spirit tell thee that thou art rich in spirituall graces, and lackest nothing, when thine owne Spirit te∣stifieth within thee, that thou art blinde, and naked, and miserable, and poore, beleeve not that Spirit. For the Spirit of God is a contest with our spirit,Rom. 8.16. , Hee beareth witnesse with our spirit that wee are the sonnes of God: and when they both sweetly accord, we may without pre∣sumption conclude with SaintTract. 22. in Joh Veritas pollicetur, qui credit habet vi∣tam aeternam, ego audivi ver∣ba Domini, credidit infidelis cum essem, fa∣ctus sum fide∣lis; sicut ipse monuit transii de morte ad vitam; in judi∣cium non ve∣nio, non prae∣sumptione meâ sed promissio∣ne ipsius. Austine; The truth promiseth, whosoever be∣leeveth in mee hath eternall life: I have heard the words of the Lord, I have beleeved; whereas I was before an Infidell, I am now made faithfull, and ac∣cording to his promise, have passed from death to life, and shall come into no condemnation. It is no presumption to ground assured confidence upon Christs promise. Hereunto let us adde the testimony of the effects of sa∣ving grace. As the testimony of the Spirit confirmeth the testimony of the Word, so the effects of saving grace confirme both unto us. These Saint Bernard reckoneth to bee, Hatred of sinne. Contempt of the world. Desire of heaven. Hatred of our unregenerate estate past, contempt of present vanities, de∣sire of future felicity. And doubtlesse if our hatred of sinne bee universall, our contempt of worldly vanities constant, and our desire of heavenly joyes fervent, wee may build upon them a strong perswasion, that we are in the favour of God, because we hate all evill; that we are espoused to Christ, because wee are divorced from the world; and that heaven belongeth unto us, because wee
long for it. Howbeit these seeme to bee rather characters of christian per∣fection, than common workes of an effectuall vocation. Though wee ar∣rive not to so high a degree of Angelicall, rather than humane perfection, yet through Gods mercy wee may bee assured of our election by other more easie and common workes of the Spirit in us, I meane, true faith, sin∣cere love of goodnesse in our selves and others, hungring and thirsting after righteousnesse, striving against our fleshly corruptions, godly sorrow, fili∣all feare, comfortable patience, and continuall growth in grace and godli∣nesse. Tully writeth ofCic. Verr. 5. Syracuse, That there is no day through the whole yeere so stormy and tempestuous, in which they have not some glympse of the sunne: neither undoubtedly after the travels of our new birth are past, is there any day so overcast with the clouds of temptation, in the soule of a Christian, in which the Sunne of righteousnesse doth not shine upon him, and some of these graces appeare in him. For if hee decay in one grace, hee may increase in another; if hee finde not in himselfe sensible growing in a∣ny grace, hee may feele in himselfe an unfained desire of such growth, and godly sorrow for want of it; and though hee conquer not all sinne, yet hee alloweth not himselfe in any sinne; and though he may have lost the sense, yet not the essence of faith; and though hee bee not assured in his owne ap∣prehension of remission of sinnes, yet hee may bee sure of his adhesion to God, and relying upon him for the forgivenesse of them, with a resoluti∣on like that of Job, Though he kill me, yet will I put my trust in him. And this is the summe and effect of what our Christian casuists answere to the second question, Quid sit, what is the white stone, whereby, as a certaine pledge, grace and glory are secured unto us. The third question yet remains, Propter quid sit, to what end this white stone is given. In the maine point of difference betweene the reformed and the Romane Church, concerning assurance of salvation, that wee bee not mis-led, wee must distinguish of a double certainty: The one of the subject, or of The person. The other of the object: or of The thing it selfe. The certainty of the one never varieth, because it dependeth upon Gods election: the certainty of the other often varieth, because it dependeth up∣on the vivacity of our faith. Even as the apple in the eye of many creatures waxeth and waineth with the Moone; and asSolin. Poly-hist. c. 56. Uni∣ones quoties excipiunt ma∣tutini aeris se∣men, fit clarius margaritum; quoties vesper∣tini, fit obscu∣rius. Solinus writeth, that the Margarite is clearer or duskier, according to the temper of the aire, and face of the skie, in which the shell-fish openeth it selfe: so this latter assurance waxeth and waineth with our faith, and is more evident, or more obscure, as our conscience is more or lesse purged from dead workes. If our faith be lively, our assurance is strong; if our faith faile, our assurance flagges, and in some fearfull temptation is so farre lost, that wee are brought to the very brinke of despaire; partly to chasten us for our former presumption, partly to abate our spirituall pride, and humble us before God, and in our owne spirits; but especially to improve the value of this jewell of assurance, and stirre us up to more diligence in using all possible meanes to regaine it, and
keep it more carefully after we have recovered it. By the causes of Gods ta∣king away of this white stone from us, or at the least hiding it out of our sight for a while, wee may ghesse at the reasons why hee imparteth it unto us. 1. First, to endeare his love unto us, and enflame ours to him. For how can wee but infinitely and eternally love him, who hath assured us of infi∣nite joyes, eternall salvation, an indefeizable inheritance, everlasting ha∣bitations, and an incorruptible crowne? 2. Secondly, to incourage us to finish our christian race, through many afflictions and persecutions for the Gospels sake; which we could never do if this crowne of glory were not hung out from heaven, and manifestly ex∣hibited to the eye of our faith, with assurance to winne it by our patience. 3. Thirdly, but especially, to kindle in us a most ardent desire, and con∣tinuall longing to arrive at our heavenly countrey, where wee shall possesse that inheritance of a kingdome, which is as surely conveighed unto us by the Word and Sacraments, as if Almighty God should presently cause a speciall deed to bee made, or patent to bee drawne for it, and set his hand and seale to it in our sight. To knit up all that hath beene delivered, that it may take up lesse roome in your memory, and bee more easily borne away; let mee entreat you to set before your eyes the custome of the Romanes, in the entertainment of any great personage, whom after they had feasted with rare dainties ser∣ved in covered dishes, at the end of the banquet they gave unto him an Apo∣phoreton, or Carry-away, as they called it; that is, some jewell or piece of coine with his name engraven on it, or some speciall poesie. Such entertain∣ment is promised in my text, and performed on this holy Table: Christ who is both Hoste and feast, biddeth you to his hidden Manna in the Sacrament, and tendereth to every one of you a white stone, with your new name writ∣ten in it, for your Apophoreton. What remaineth, but that by particular exa∣mination, and fervent prayer, and speciall faith, and intention of devotion, yee prepare your stomacks for these covered dishes, and the hidden Man∣na; and after you have fed upon it, receive the white stone of absolution, and keepe it safe by you, and have it alwayes in your eyes? Let not your importunate clients so trespasse upon your time, but that you reserve al∣wayes some golden moments in every day, and especially on the Lords day, to bee clients to God. So peruse other writings and Records, that you forget not to search the deeds and evidences of your owne salvation: before you give learned counsaile to others, to secure and cleare their titles to their lands on earth, aske you counsaile of the spirit; and with David,Psal. 119.24 make Gods statutes your counsailers, to secure your title to a kingdome in heaven. Make your election, whereof the white stone in my text is a cleare evidence, sure unto your selves, by the markes which I have described unto you, hatred of sinne, and contempt of the world, and desire of heaven; secure it to your soules by the life of your faith, and strength of your hope, and ardency of your love, and extremity of your hunger and thirst for righ∣teousnesse, and your earnest strife and most vehement fight against all your corruptions, by your deepe sorrow for your sinnes, carefull watching over all your wayes, sonnelike feare of displeasing your heavenly father, univer∣sall conformity to his will, and humble submission to his rod, with conti∣nuall
growth in grace, and mending your pace towards heaven, the nearer you come to your journyes end. So shall you overcome the devill by your faith, the world by your hope, the flesh by your spirituall love, sinfull joyes by your godly sorrow, carnall security by your watchfull care and filiall feare, dreadfull crosses by your comfortable patience, and dangerous relap∣ses by your proficiencie in godlinesse, and all sorts of temptations by your constant perseverance: And thus overcomming, Christ will make good his promise unto you, set before you the hidden Manna, and give you this white stone, which none shall be able to take away from you; and lay you all, as so many pretious stones, in theApoc. 21.19. foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem, descending from God: To whom, &c.
THE NEW NAME. THE XXVIII. SERMON. APOC. 2.17. And in the same stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving hee that receiveth it. Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. IN this close of a letter, endited by the Spirit, and en∣dorsed to the Angell of the Church of Pergamus, our Emperour Christ Jesus his donatives to his victorious souldiers are set forth to the best advantage of art. To him, that is, to every one whosoever hee bee, Jew or Gentile, bond or free, young or old, Captaine or com∣mon souldier, that overcommeth the flesh by subduing it, the world by de∣spising it, the devill by defying him, and quenching all his fiery darts on the buckler of his faith dipt in Christs blood; I will give out of my bounty, not for the merit of their service, the hidden Manna of consolation, the white stone of absolution, and the new name of adoption, which no man knoweth sa∣ving hee that receiveth it. The hidden Manna I set before you, when I first entertained your reli∣gious attention with the mysticall delicacies this text affordeth. The last time I delivered unto you the white stone: and now I am to spell and read un∣to you your new name, and both declare what it is, and why engraven in this white stone; as also, how so engraven that it can bee read by none save him who owneth it. For my method, I will take it from Masters of Mu∣sicke and dancing: for as they first tune their instruments, then finger the streines of some exquisite lessons on it, & finally teach their scholars how
to foot the dance accordingly: so the divine assistance concurring with your patience, I will first, by endevouring to accord the severall interpre∣tations of the words, as it were, tune the strings: next, by delivering unto you the doctrines of this scripture, set to the lessons: and last of all, by ap∣plying them to your lives and conversations, direct you how you are to or∣der your feet, according to the heavenly musicke pricked by the Spirit in the rules of my text. But because it is very hard to read letters or characters engraven in brasse or stone, if the brasse or stone bee covered with dirt, or blotted with inke; before I proceed to spell your name, I hold it requisite to rubbe out those spots, and wipe away those blots, which the ancient Pelagians, and late Pontificians have cast upon this white stone; I meane, our Protestant doctrine concerning the assurance of our salvation in particular. 1. They cast this blurre upon it, That it hath no foundation in holy Scripture; for where read wee, say they, thou William, or thou John, or thou Peter art assured of thy salvation? 2. They cast this blurre upon it, That it hath no place in the Apostles Creed, and therefore in scorne and derision they tearme it the thirteenth article. 3. They alledge against it, That it hath no footing at all in reason. For, say they, wee ought continually to pray for the remission of our sinnes, which wee need not to doe if wee were assured of our justification and sal∣vation. 4. They article against it, That it crosseth all such texts of Scripture, wherein feare is commended unto us, as a speciall helpe and furtherance to eternall salvation. To what end doth David advise,Psal. 2.11. Serve the Lord with feare: and Saint Paul admonish,Rom 11.20. Be not high minded, but feare: and,Phil. 2.12. work out your salvation with feare and trembling: and Saint Peter exhort,1 Pet. 1.17. passe the time of your sojourning here in feare; if all true beleevers are so assured of their salvation, that they are in no danger of forfeiting their estate of grace here, or losing their crowne of glory hereafter? 5. They alleage against it, That it dulleth the edge of industry, and coo∣leth the heat of zeale, and taketh away all care of walking exactly before God, and uprightly before men: care and watchfulnesse, in their judge∣ment, are superfluous where salvation and eternall happinesse is secured. The first blot is thus wiped out.Resp. ad 1. As all parts are contained in the whole body, so all particulars and singulars are vertually enclosed in generals and universals: and therefore as when wee read, That all men are sinners; and, all men are deprived of the glory of God; and, in many things wee offend all, every man layeth his hand upon his heart, and acknowledgeth himselfe to bee of the number: and as when wee read, Wee must all appeare before the tribunall seat of Christ, every good Christian applieth it unto himselfe, and maketh full account one day to answer at that barre: so when peace of con∣science, and joy in the holy Ghost, and assurance of eternall blisse are pro∣mised to all beleevers in Scripture, every faithfull heart rejoiceth at them, as having speciall interest in them. I would faine know of our adversaries, when a Proclamation is published in the Kings name to all his loyall sub∣jects, whether every particular man within his realmes and dominions bee
not liable to the Kings high displeasure, in case hee disobey this his Maje∣sties edict, though no man be therein particularly named. Now what are the Ministers of the Gospell, but Gods Cryers, to proclaime his good plea∣sure, concerning the receiving all penitent sinners and beleevers into grace and favour? Our adversaries themselves beleeve that this Pope Urban the eighth is Christs Vicar, and cannot erre in Cathedrâ; and that this Priest, viz. Fisher, or Musket, hath power to remit sinnes, and in the administra∣tion of the Sacrament, to turne the bread into Christs body; yet let them turne over all the Bible, they shall no where finde the name of Priest Mus∣ket, Father Fisher, or Pope Urban. Here if they flye to generall promises, made to all the Apostles and their successors, they stifle the winde-pipe of their owne objection, and confesse consequently, so the generall be in Scrip∣ture, wee need not trouble our selves with the particular. But the generall I have proved at large out of Scripture, that assurance of salvation is a privi∣ledge granted to all the children of God, that heare the testimony of the Spirit, and see the infallible markes of Gods chosen in themselves. Resp. ad 2.The second blot is thus rubbed out: This white stone, the assurance of a mans particular salvation, is comprised in the first words of the Creed, which according to the exposition of theEusch. Emis∣sen. in symb. Ancies, importeth, I trust in God for salvation. For wee say not, I beleeve there is a God, which is cre∣dere Deum; nor I beleeve God, which is credere Deo; but I beleeve in God, that is, I put my religious trust and confidence in him. Beside, the true meaning of that article, I beleeve the forgivenesse of sinnes, is not on∣ly, I beleeve there is a remission of sinnes in the Church, which the divell himselfe doth, and yet is no whit the better for it; but I beleeve the remis∣sion of my owne sinnes, as I doe the resurrection of my owne flesh. And if this bee the true meaning of that Article, which Rome and Rhemes shall ne∣ver bee able to disprove, the assurance of our owne justification and salvati∣on is not, as they cavill, a thirteenth article of the Creed, but part of the tenth. To which SaintIn psal. 32. Dicit anima fe∣cura. Deus me∣us es tu, quia dicit Deus ani∣mae ego sum tua slus. Austine subscribed; The devout soule saith confi∣dently, thou art my God, because God saith to the soule, I am thy salvation. Resp. ad 3.The third blot is thus wiped out: Prayer for remission of sinnes, and as∣surance thereof may well stand together. After the Prophet Nathan had said to David, The Lord hath taken away thy sinne, David beleeved the re∣mission thereof; yet hee prayed most fervently for it:Psal. 51.7.14. Purge mee with Hyssope and I shall be cleane, wash mee and I shall bee whiter than snow. Hide thy face from my sinnes, and blot out all mine iniquities, deliver me from blood guiltinesse O God, thou God of my salvation. Our blessed Redeemer was as∣sured that God would deliver him from the power of death andPsal. 16.10. hell; yet in theHeb. 5.7. dayes of his flesh he offered up prayers with strong cryes to him that was able to save him. Saint Paul was assured by faith, that God would2 Tim. 4.18. deliver him from every evill worke, and preserve him to his heavenly kingdome; yet hee ceased not to pray, Libera nos à malo; Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evill. To cut all the sinewes of this objection at once, wee distinguish of three sorts of Christians: 1 Incipients. 2 Proficients. 3 Perfect.
Incipients pray for the remission of their sinnes, and assurance thereof to their conscience: Proficients for greater assurance, and farther growth in grace: those that are perfect (so farre as perfection may be attained in this life) for the abolishing of all power of sinne in them, and their publike ac∣quitting at the last day: and all three for a pardon of course, at least for such sinnes of infirmity, as sticke so close unto us that we cannot shake them off till we put off this earthly tabernacle. For albeit every true beleever is firmely perswaded of the love of God, and the free pardon of all his sinnes in generall; yet because no particular sinne can be actually remitted before it be committed, neither is the remission of any promised, but upon conditi∣on of repentance, and confession to God of all knowne sinnes in speciall, andPsal. 19.12. Who can un∣derstand his er∣rours? O cleanse thou me from secret faults. unknowne in generall: every one that is carefull of his salvation, and mindfull of the command of Christ implyed in the patterne of all prayer, will sue out a pardon for every new sin, which through the frailty of his na∣ture he falleth into, by humble confession and prayer to God. Which pray∣er, because it cannot be acceptable to him without faith, he who prayeth for the remission of his sinnes, in the very instant when he prayeth beleeveth that God will heare him, and that he either hath, or will certainely pardon him. And so we see that this third objection either hath no edge at all, or if it hath any, woundeth the adversaries cause, if it be thus retorted against him. Whatsoever we pray to God for according to his will, we ought stedfastly to beleeve that we shall receive it. But every true beleever prayeth for the remission of his sins, accor∣ding to Gods will and command. Therefore every true beleever ought stedfastly to perswade him∣selfe that his sinnes are, or shall be certainely forgiven him. The fourth blot is thus wiped out. Feare is twofold: 1 That which is opposed to carnall security. 2 That which is opposed to spirituall confidence. The former is commanded in all the texts above alledged, and must stand with assurance of salvation; the latter is forbidden by Esay;Esay 41.14. Feare not, thou worme Jacob, and ye men of Israel: I will helpe thee, saith the Lord, and thy Redeemer.c. 43. ver. 1. Feare not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine. And byLuk. 1.68, 69 74. Zachary in his Hymne; Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which hath visited and redeemed his people. And hath raised up an horne of salvation for us in the house of his servant David. That we being delivered from the hands of our enemies, might serve him without feare. And by St. Paul,Rom. 8.15. Ye have not received the Spirit of bondage againe to feare. And byLuke 12.32. Christ himselfe, Feare not little flocke, for it is your Fa∣thers pleasure to give you the kingdome. This latter feare, because it exclu∣deth confidence in God, is excluded it selfe: but the former not onely stan∣deth with certainty of perseverance in grace, but mightily supporteth it. For even for this end God promiseth to put that feare in the hearts of all
true believers, thatJer. 32.40. they may not fall away from him. Whereupon Tertulli∣an acutely inferreth, playing upon the double sense of the Latine word se∣curus;De cult Jern. Qui secutus est non est soli∣citus, qui est so∣licitus potest esse secutus. Hee that is secure (that is, carelesse) of the meanes of his salvation, is not solicitous or watchfull; but hee that is solicitous or watchfull may bee se∣cure, that is, free from all feare of unavoidable danger. The last objection which our adversaries make against the doctrine deli∣vered, is taken out of the worme-eaten evidence of the ancient Pelagians, as wee may see in SaintEp. ad August. Dicunt lapsis curam resur∣gendi adunt, & sanctis occasi∣onem teporis offerri, eo quod electi nulla negligentiâ possint excide∣re. Hage confe∣rence, p. 12. &c. Prosper: They (viz. the Pelagians) upbraid, that all care of rising out of sinne is taken away from those that are lapsed; that to ho∣ly men is ministred an occasion of slacknesse in their devotion, or lukewarmnesse, inasmuch as the Elect (according to our doctrine) cannot fall away by any negli∣gence, howsoever they behave themselves; & that consequently this doctrine ta∣keth away all praiers, obsecrations, obtestations, exercise of mortification, & care of the means of renewing our covenant with God, and watchfulnesse over all our wayes. But wee answer with the ancientAug. de cor∣rep. & grat. Prosp. resp. ad obect Vincent. Fathers, that the certainty of the end no way derogateth from the necessity of the means of salvation, which on Gods part are admonitions, threatnings, promises, commands, counsels, punishments and rewards: on our part, continuall prayer, watchfulnesse, pro∣gresse in godlinesse, & unfained desire of, and earnest striving for perfection. After Christ prayed for S. Peters faith, thatLuk. 22.32. I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not. it might not faile, Peter was as∣sured of his perseverance; yet Christ commandeth him with the rest,Mar. 14.37.38. Christ saith to Peter, Si∣mon sleepest thou? couldst not thou watch with mee one houre? watch & pray lest yee en∣ter into temp∣tation. to watch and pray lest they enter into temptation: watchfulnesse therefore and assurance are not incompatible. None ever had greater assurance of their salvation than the Apostles, after Christ cheared their hearts,Luk. 10.20. In this re∣joice, not that spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven: yet our Saviour admonisheth them toLuk. 12.35. stand with their loynes girt about, and their lights burning; and to take heed to them∣selvesLk. 21.34. lest at any time their hearts be overcharged with surfetting and drun∣kennesse, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon them at unawares. Questionlesse after Christ had given to SaintAct. 27.24. Paul the life of all them that were in the ship with him, hee was assured of their safe arrivall; yet when the shipmen were about to flye out of the ship, under colour as though they would have cast anchor, Paul said to the Centurion, and to the souldiers, ex∣cept these abide in the ship, you cannot bee saved. None may otherwise re∣ceive or apply to themselves the promises of grace, and remission of sinnes, than they are tendred to them in holy Scripture: but in them they are pro∣pounded unto all upon condition of repentance, faith, holinesse of life, new obedience, and perseverance in it to the end. To beleeve therefore the re∣mission of sinnes, and to bee assured of Gods favour, notwithstanding wee hold on our sinfull courses, is not spirituall confidence, but carnall presump∣tion. Assurance of salvation is an effect of a lively faith, whichGal. 5.6. worketh by love; and consequently all that have it, the more they are assured of Gods love to them in Christ, the more their hearts are enflamed with love towards God, and their neighbour also for Gods sake; the more zealous they will bee of his glory, the more thankefull for his mercy, the more desirous to please him, the more fearfull to offend him, the more carefull to obey him, the more wounded with godly sorrow for their incurring his displeasure,
and the more ready to turne unto him by unfained repentance. Admit what they so much clamour against us for, that the adopted sonnes of God are in no feare or distrust that their heavenly Father will disinhe∣rite them; yet neither may they, nor can they presume hereupon wil∣fully to provoke him; because they know that hee hath many sharpe roddes to chasten them with besides; as temporall plagues, painefull sicknesse, irrecoverable losses, terrours of conscience, and spirituall deserti∣on. To conclude, the certainty of our beliefe that wee shall undoubtedly arrive at the celestiall Canaan, is no reason why we should flacke, but rather mend our pace thither. Thus having wiped out the spots and blots, which the ancient and lat∣ter Pelagians have fast upon the white stone, we shall more easily be able to discerne the characters engraven in it, and read The new name. Wee receive many new things from our Saviour: 1 AMat. 26.28. new Testament signed with his blood. 2 In this new Testament a newHeb. 8.8. Covenant. 3 In this new Covenant a newJoh. 13.34. Commandement. 4 To obey this new Commandement a newEzek. 36.26. heart. 5 And answerable to this new Heart newMar. 16.17. Tongues. 6 And consonant to these new Tongues newApoc. 14.3. Songs. Behold,Apoc. 21.5. I make all things new, a new2 Pet. 3.13. heaven and a new earth, and a newApoc. 21.2. city, and in it newEph. 4.24. inhabitants, to whom the Spirit here promiseth a2 Cor. 5.17. new name, upon which the Interpreters have many new conceits. Alcazar the Jesuite, whose profound head the Pope lately graced with a Cardinals hat, in his prolixe commentaries upon the Apocalyps, falling upon the words of my text, will needs have this new name to be some deriva∣tive from Jesus, as Jesuitae or Jesuati, or the like. For this name Jesus (as out of Galatians hee endevoureth to prove) according to the true chara∣cters and points in the Hebrew, is novum nomen, a new name, never given to any but our Saviour: & of this name above all other names it is most certain that no man knoweth the vertue thereof, but he that is partaker of it. In which interpretation the Jesuites affection seemeth to me to have over-swayed his judgement. For as Aristoxenus the Musician, out of an admiration of his own profession, defined the soule to be anCic. Tusc. 1. harmony; so this expositour, out of a love to his own society, resolveth this new name can be no other than a deno∣minative from Jesus. But he should have considered that this new name here promised to the Angel of Pergamus, is 1500. yeeres elder than Ignatius their Patriarch; and is not promised to him onely, but to all Christian con∣querours in alleges; whereas the name Jesuite, before Layola in this age so christened his disloyall off-spring, was never heard of in the world. Nei∣ther lyeth there hid such a mystery in the name Jesuite, that no man knoweth it saving hee that receiveth it: it is knowne well enough, not onely to Roma∣nists of other orders, but also to those of the reformed Church, who yet never received the badge of their profession, nor any marke of theApoc. 14 9. beast. Victorinus and some others with more probability ghesse the new name to be here meant Christianus, of which they understand those words
ofEsa. 62.2. Esay, they shall bee called by my new name. Aretas giveth the same interpretation of the white stone, and the new name, by both which the conquerour in proving masteries was made knowne to the people. Carthusian distinguishing of the essentiall and accidentall rewards in hea∣ven, and calling the former auream, the latter aureolam, conceiveth this white stone to bee aureolam, a gemme added to the Saints crowne of glo∣ry; & in it the name of Beatus engraven, which no man can know but he that receiveth it; because1 Cor. 2.9. eye hath not seene, nor eare heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. Illyr. in Apoc Scribam cum haeredem vitae aeternae.Illyricus and Osiander relating the custome of the Romanes in the ele∣ction of their chiefe Magistrates, to write his name to whom they gave their voice in a white stone, thus comment upon the words of my text: Him that overcommeth I will entertaine with hidden Manna, and I will declare him heire apparent to a crowne in heaven, I will elect him to a kingdome. Comment. in 2. Apoc.Pareus expoundeth novum nomen, nomen dignitate praestans, a name of honour and renowne. Junius annot in Apoc. Indu∣endo novum hominem, quem nemo novit nisi spiri∣tus hominis, qui in ipso est, cujus laus non est ex homini∣bus, sed ex Deo.Junius glosseth it, signum & indicium novitatis vitae, a signe and token of newnesse of life. Lastly, Victor Pictabionensis, Sardus, Beda, Bulenger, Melo, Primasius, Rupertus, Pererius, and other expositours, generally concurre upon Filius Dei; the new name; say they, written in the white stone, is the sunne of God. Which their opinion they illustrate by other texts of Scripture; as name∣ly, Rom. 8.15.16. and, 1 Joh. 3.1. and they backe it with this reason; The new name here is such a one as no man knoweth saving hee that receiveth it, and what can that name bee but the title of the sonnes of God, which no man knoweth, saving hee that receiveth the Spirit of adoption, whereby hee cryethRom. 8.16. Abba Father; which Spirit testifieth to his spirit that hee is the childe of God? All other expositions may after a sort bee reduced to this, for this is a blessed name, according to Carthusians interpretation: for the chil∣dren of God are the children of the resurrection, and they are most happy. It is the name of Christian conquerors, according to Victorinus and Are∣tas his glosse; for1 Joh. 5.4. every one that is borne of God overcommeth the world; and, this is the victory that overcommeth the world, even our faith. This is al∣so a symbol and token of newnesse of life; for all the regenerate sonnes of GodEph. 4.24. have put on the new man. This name indeed is a glorious name in Pa∣reus his sense; for if it were an honour to David to bee sonne-in-law to an earthly King, how much more honourable is it to be the adopted sonne of the King of heaven? Lastly, this name importeth, according to Illyricus and Osianders joint explication, haeredem vitae aeternae, heire of eternall life; for ifRom. 8.17. sonnes, then heires. And thus, as you heare, the strings are tuned, and all interpretations ac∣corded: now I set to the lessons, or doctrinall points, which are foure; 1 The title of sonnes, novum nomen. 2 The assurance of this title, inscriptum calculo. 3 The knowledge of this assurance, novit qui recipit. 4 The propriety of this knowledge, nemo novit nisi qui recipit
The Roman Generals after their conquests of great countries and cities, had new names given unto them; as to Publius Scipio was given the sir∣name of Africanus, to Lucius Scipio of Asiaticus, to Metellus of Numidicus, to Pompey of Hierosolymarius: in like manner our celestiall Emperour pro∣miseth to all that overcome their spirituall enemies, a new name, and emi∣nent title of honour; even that which Alexander the conquerour of the whole world most triumphed in, when the Egyptian Priest saluted him, , Sonne of God. But why is this called a new name? Either because it is unknown to the world, and worldly men; or in opposition to our old name, which was, sonnes of Adam. That is the name of our nature, this of grace; that of our shame and misery, this of our glory and happi∣nesse; that is a name from the earth, earthly, this is a name from the Lord of heaven, heavenly. And it appertaineth to all the Saints of God in a threefold respect: 1 Of Regeneration. 2 Adoption. 3 Imitation. Regeneration maketh them sonnes of God: Adoption heires with Christ: Imitation like both. When the Astronomer that calculated the nativity of Reginaldus Polus was derided of all, because the disposition of the man was knowne to all to be contrary to those characters which he gave of him, Poole facetely excu∣sed the matter, saying, Such an one I was by my first nativity as hee hath de∣scribed me, but since that I was born again. This , or second birth, though Nicodemus at the first deemed a riddle, because it could not enter into his head, how a man could re-enter his Mothers wombe, and be borne the second time; yet after our Saviour ingeminated this doctrine unto him,Joh. 3.5. Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, hee cannot enter into the kingdome of God, hee gave credit unto it, as all must doe who look for the inheritance1 Pet. 1.4. incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for them:1 Pet. 1.3. for all those are begotten again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, not with corruptible seed, but with incorruptible: and after they are begotten they are born again of water and the Spirit, &1 Pet. 2.2. as new born babes they desire the sincere milk of the word, that they may grow therby; and as they grow2 Cor. 4.16. the old man decayeth in them, and the inward man is renewed daily. Inregard of which great alteration and change wrought in them by the Spirit of regeneration was it, that the holy Father, when hee was solicited by the Mistresse of his affections in former times, claiming ancient familiarity with him, put her off, saying, Ego nunc non sum ego; I am not the man thou takest me for: thou art indeed thou, remai∣ning still in thy unregenerate estate, but I am not I. And unlesse wee all feele and observe in usRom. 12.2. a transformation by the renewing of our minde, that wee may prove what is that good, that acceptable and perfect will of God, we cannot challenge to our selves this new name, whereunto the Saints of God have yet a second right, by theRom. 8.15. Spirit of adoption.
Adoption, asSum 1. p. . 93. Art. 4. Adopo filiorum Di est per confor∣mitaem ad ∣maginem fil natur lis, n∣perftè pu∣de p gti∣am, perfce per glorm. Aquinas defineth it, is, by conformity to the image of the na∣turall sonne of God; imperfectly by grace here, and perfectly by glory hereafter. But this great Schoole-man, it seemeth, was no great Lawyer, nor dived deepe into the nature of Adoption; which he here counfoundeth partly with sanctification, which is our conformity in part to Christ by grace; and partly with glorification, which is our perfect conformity to him, when our sanctification is consummate in heaven. In precise truth, adoption is not by our conformity to the image of Christ, but our confor∣mity to the image of Christ is by the spirit of adoption. Adoption, saithSen. controv. Ad p est sit quae benefi natu∣rae & juris imi∣tatur. Se∣neca, is a most sacred thing, containing in it an imitation of nature, civilly giving them sonnes, whom nature hath left childlesse; and it may be briefly defined, a legall supply of a naturall defect, whereby they who can beget no chil∣dren, yet make heires, to propagate their names to posterity, ut sic abolita seculis nomina per successores novos fulgeant. According to which definition, God cannot be properly said to adopt any children, though he give them the ti∣tles of sons, and make them coheirs with Christ: for adoptio est fortunae reme∣dium, is provided as a remedy and comfort of those who are destitute of children, and want heires; God wanteth none, neither doth hee adopt for his contentment, but for our solace and comfort. In civill adoption the son begotten is not adopted, the adopted is not begotten: Nulla viro soboles imitatur adoptio prolem. But in the divine adoption it is otherwise. For God adopteth no sonne by grace whom hee regenerateth not by his Spirit. Moreover, in civill adoption the ground is either consanguinity or affinity, which moved Julius to adopt Octavius: or if neither, eminencie of vertue and simili∣tude of disposition, which induced Nerva to adopt Trajan. But in the di∣vinePli pangyr. Nulla adopta∣ti cum adopta∣to cognatio, null cessitu∣do, nisi quod uterque opti∣ms rat, dig∣ns; alter li∣gi, alter eligere. adoption on the contrary, God adopteth not us because of any kindred or alliance in us to him antecedently; but he sent his sonne to take our nature upon him, and become kinne to us, that for his sake hee might have some occasion to adopt us. Men adopt those in whom they see worth, but God first loveth and giveth worth, that he may more worthily adopt: and they whom he so adopteth by the grace which he conferreth upon them, procure to themselves a third right to this title of sonnes by imitation of their father. This imitation consisteth in walking after the Spirit, as he is a Spirit: in following after holinesse, as he is most holy: in loving mercy, as his mercy is over all his workes: in purifying our hearts and hands, as he is purity it selfe: in doing good to those that deserve ill of us, as he causeth hisMat. 5.45. sunne to rise upon the good and the bad, and his raine to fall upon the just and the un∣just: lastly, to aspire to perfection, as he is perfection it selfe. In the holy language of Scripture rather expression of vertue than impression of fea∣ture maketh a sonne: all that through faith prevaile with God are accounted of the seed of Israel, and all beleevers the sonnes of Abraham: and be∣cause the unbeleeving Jewes did not the workes of Abraham, Christ deny∣eth them to be his children.John 8.39 If yee were the children of Abraham, yee would doe the workes of Abraham. WhereuponSerm. 125. in Evang. Qui genitotis ope∣n facit, a∣a genus. Chrysologus inferreth, He that
doth not the workes of his Progenitors, in effect disclaimeth his linage. Con∣stantine the great tooke not such joy in his sonne Constantius because he fa∣voured him in his countenance, as because heNazarius in panogyr. Praestantissi∣mum Princi∣pem hoc maxi∣mè juvit, quod in primoribus annis ductae sunt lineae qui∣bus virtutumsu∣arum effigies posset includi. saw in his tender yeeres an as∣say, and as it were the first draught of his owne vertues. On the contrary, the Roman Censors tooke such a distast at the sonne of Africanus for his de∣bauched life, that they tooke a ring off his finger, in which the image of his father was ingraven, because he so much degenerated from his fathers excellent vertues; they would not suffer him to weare his fathers picture in a ring, whose image he bare not in his minde: neither will God suffer any to beare his name, and be accounted his sonnes, who beare not his image, who resemble not his attributes in their vertues, his simplicity in their sincerity, his immutability in their constancy, his purity in their chastity, his good∣nesse in their charity, his holinesse in their piety, his justice in their integri∣ty. Regeneration is wrought in the heart knowne to God onely; adopti∣on is an act sped in the court of heaven, which none knoweth on earth but he that receiveth an exemplification of it by the Spirit: but imitation of our heavenly Father, by a heavenly conversation, proclaimeth us to all the world to be his sonnes. The title thus cleared, the next point is the perpe∣tuity thereof, represented unto us by the engraving the new name in the white stone: I will give him a white stone, and in it a new name written or engraven. When the Pharisees appeached the woman taken , in the foule act of adultery, it is there said, that our Saviour stooping downe wrote on the ground: but what he wrote the Evangelist writeth not. SaintIn Evang. Terram terra accusat. Ambrose ghesseth that he wrote Earth accuseth earth: St. Austine these words, He that among you is free from sinne, let him cast the first stone. Others are of opinion that he wrote in the dust some private sinnes of the accusers; whose opinion hath thus farre footing in Scripture, that God, whose mercy is over all his workes, writeth the sinnes of men in dust, but his gifts and favours with a Diamond in precious gemmes; as we may see onExod. 28.20. Aarons breastplate, and here in a solid white stone. White stones, such as this in my text, were in great use among the Ro∣mans, and served 1 To declare the victour or conquerour in proving masteries. 2 To acquit the accused in courts of justice. 3 To deliver suffrages in the election of Magistrates. Upon all these uses the allegory in my text toucheth. For this white stone is given in token of victory, Vincenti dabo: and before I demonstrated it to bee an evidence of our justification; and now I shall shew it to bee an as∣surance of our election to a kingdome in heaven. As in the civill, so much more in the divine use, the act signified or done by it is altogether irrevoca∣ble. Hee to whom the white stone was given in the theater, or wheresoever the silver games were kept, or prizes plaid, was ever held Victor, and carri∣ed that title to his grave. Hee upon whom the Judges passed their sen∣tence by casting white stones into an urne or pitcher, was for ever acquitted of the crime laid to his charge. Hee who gave his voice to any man, by writing his name in a white stone, neither did nor could after varie: and
shall wee thinke that hee to whom Christ giveth his white stone shall ever lose the benefit thereof? The names of the twelve tribes engraven upon the twelve pretious stones on Aarons breast-plate, continued for many hundreds of yeers, as you may read in Josephus, and may be in them still for ought we know; yet if they could be razed out, certainly their names cannot be blotted outLuk. 10 20. which are written in heaven. The calling and gifts of God are withoutRom. 11.29. repentance, especially this of adoption in SaintAh. de Isac. & vit. beat. Num Deus pa∣ter ipsequi con∣tulit, potest sua dona rescinde∣re & qus a∣doptione sus∣cepit, eos à pa∣terni affectus gratiâ relegare? Ambrose his judgement: What, saith hee, can God the Father reverse his owne grants? can hee cast him out of his fatherly grace, whom hee hath once adopted? by no meanes. For though a servant may cease to bee a servant if his Master ca∣shiere him; and a tenant to bee a tenant if hee have forfeited his estate, yet a sonne cannot cease to bee a sonne; hee that is borne, cannot but bee borne; and if hee bee borne of God hee cannot , though hee may , he cannot doe though he may suffer sin, that is, he cannot practise it, as a man doth his trade or profession, in a settled course, without checke of conscience, or reluctancy, because the seed of God remaineth in him, which fighteth against the poyson instilled by Satan, and will in the end conquer it, because it is1 Pet. 1.23. incorruptible seed. When a childe of God is at the worst, and hath recei∣ved the greatest foyle in temptation, hee remaineth still the child of GodAbbat. prae∣lect. de verit. grat. & Dia∣trib. cont. Tompson. quoad sigillum, though not quoad signum; according to the seale, though not according to the signe: lose he may the signe in himselfe, but God can∣not lose his seale. You will say peradventure, this assertion openeth a window to presump∣tion, and carnall liberty: nay rather it shutteth the leaves against it, and fa∣steneth them with surest bolts and barres. For lay this for a ground, that he that hath received the Spirit of regeneration, and grace of adoption, can∣not sinne desperately, nor give absolute way to any corruption: the conclu∣sion to bee built upon it will bee this (which necessarily checketh and choa∣keth all presumptuous thoughts) That whosoever defileth his mouth with oathes or lies, his hand with bribes, his body with uncleannesse, his con∣science with any knowne sinne, finding in himselfe no checke with it, no struggling against it, no smiting of the heart after it, no earnest desire, and in the end effectuall working out of it; was never a true convert, the sunne of righteousnesse never rose on him, because hee yet lyeth frozen in the dregs of his naturall corruption.Cant. 2 5. Stay me with flaggons, and comfort me with apples, for I am sicke of love; the doctrine of the perpetuity of the regenerates e∣state is a cup of the strongest wine in those flaggons, which must bee given to none but such as amore languent, such as have beene contracted to Christ, and have received from him many jewels of grace, and infallible tokens of speciall affection, though at the present by some fearefull provocation, they have so farre incurred his displeasure, that hee will not looke upon their teares, nor hearken to their sighes or groanes, nor once turne his countenance towards them, which they infinitely value above their life. To these we are to minister this cordiall; That Christ his contract with the soul is indissolu∣ble, that the Covenant of his peace is immovable, that the seed of regenerati∣on is immortall, that whom God loveth he loveth to the end, that they may have lost the sense, but they cannot the essence of true faith, that their new name is still written upon the white stone, though such a mist be cast before
their eyes that they cannot reade it now; but after a great defluxe of pe∣nitent teares, Christ will annoint them with the eye-salve of his Spirit, and then they shall clearely see and reade it: for hee that receiveth it knoweth it. And so I fall into the third point, the knowledge of this perpetuity: Hee knoweth it who receiveth it. As the eye seeth either 1. Per radium rectum, a streight line drawne from the eye to the object: Or, 2. Per radium reflexum, a beame reflected from the object to the eye: so the soul hath a double knowledge; direct, of the object; and reflexe, of her owne acts. As when I looke in a glasse I looke upon my selfe looking in it: when I touch my pulse I feele my feeling of it: in like manner the soule by reflexive knowledge apprehendeth her owne apprehension, judgeth of her owne judgement, and beleeveth her owne faith and beliefe. How can there be any assurance by faith, if there be no assurance of faith it selfe? SaintEp. 112 c 3. Fides ipsa men∣te u{que} vide∣tur quamvis hoc fide creda∣tur quod non videtur. Au∣stine is most expresse for this reflexive act of faith: Faith it selfe, saith hee, is seene in the minde, though wee believe those things by faith which wee can∣not see: and again,De trin. l. 13. c. 2. Fides est in intimis nostris mentibus, nec eam quisquam hominum vi∣det in alio, sed in semet-ipso. Faith is in the inward parts of the soule, neither can any man see it in another, but in himselfe hee may. Could there bee any doubt of this, I would evict it out of the expresse words of our Saviour (Joh. 14.20.) In that day you shall know that I am in the Father, and you in mee, and I in you. And of Saint Paul:2 Cor. 13.5. Examine your selves whether you be in the faith or no. Know yee not your selves that Christ is in you, except you bee reprobates? And,2 Tim. 1.12. I know whom I have believed. And,1 Cor. 2.12. Wee have not received the Spi∣rit of the World, but the Spirit of God, that wee might know the things that are freely given us of God. Hang up a taper or a carbuncle in a darke roome, and you shall perceive that first it discovereth it selfe by its owne light, and then all things in the roome. This taper or carbuncle is faith in the soule, which as it manifesteth all other graces, so most clearly also it selfe. The heat by the incident beame of the sunne is but weake, the greatest is by the reflected: so is it in the act of faith, there is but small warmth of comfort from the direct act, whereby wee beleeve the singular priviledges of all true beleevers; the greatest comfort is by the reflexive, viz. that wee are true beleevers, and share in those comforts. Without this reflexive know∣ledge there can beeRom. 14.5. no , full perswasion in our mindes, much lesseEph. 3.12. In whom wee have boldnesse and accesse with confidence by the faith of him. accesse with confidence. Which yet the auncient Fathers not onely teach plainly out of the Apostle, but also shew manifestly how it may be obtained. S.Moral. q. 12. , &c. Basil putteth this case of conscience: How may the soule assuredly bee per∣swaded that God hath forgiven unto her her sinnes? And hee resolveth it thus: When shee findeth in her selfe the like disposition and affection to his, that said, I hate iniquity, and all false wayes I utterly abhorre. SaintAmb. Serm. 2. de serm. Ambrose thus: He that cleaveth to that leaven is made himselfe leaven, and thereby sure of his owne salvation, and secure of gaining others to the faith. SaintLeo Serm. 2. de pasch. Leo thus: If they finde any of the fruits of charity in their conscience, let them not doubt but that God is in them. But wee need not borrow torch light where the sunne shineth so bright in holy scriptures.1 Joh. 5.10. Hee that beleeveth in the sonne of God hath the testimony in himselfe: And, theRom. 8.16. Spirit testifieth to our spirit, that we are the sonnes of God; the Spirit of God warranteth the ma∣jor, In whomsoever the markes of Gods children, set downe in scripture,
are conspicuous, they are the sonnes of God: our Spirit testifieth the mi∣nor, that these marks are in us. Now because this assumption can be proved no otherwise than by experience, and our owne inward sense, my fourth ob∣servation hence directly ensueth, That no man knoweth the new name save he that receiveth it: which is the last point now to be touched, and note to be quavered on in my close, viz. the propriety of this knowledge. None knoweth save he that receiveth it. For no man knoweth the things of a man, save the1 Cor. 2.11. spirit of man that is in him. If this white stone were visi∣ble to the eye of the body, and it were given to us in presence of others, it could not be but that some should see and know it besides him that recei∣veth it. But this white stone is conspicuous only to the eye of faith, which is theHeb. 11.1. evidence of things not seene, and it is given by the Spirit which is in∣visible, and received also by the inward faculties of our soule, which are likewise invisible. Were this knowledge onely conjecturall, and gathered from outward signes and tokens, others might have notice thereof as well as our selves: but the Spirit saith here, No man knoweth save he that recei∣veth it. It must be therefore a speciall act of speciall faith whereby we are assured of our adoption by faith, and of faith by the Spirit.In Apoc. Sint duo quorum uterque lau∣dat mel, sed alterus lingua loquitur quod fauces igno∣rant, alterius quod delectatio gustus cum do∣cuerit. Ansbertus giveth good aime to the meaning of this text: Suppose two (saith he) com∣mending hony, of whom the first discourseth out of his reading, the tongue of the second hath tasted that he speaketh of, such (saith he) is the knowledge of him who hath received the white stone. Others may know it in specie, but he in individuo: others contemplatively, but he experimentally.in Apoc. Tan∣tae excellentiae est nomen istud, ut nemo sciat quid vale∣at, quantum boni compre∣hendat, nisi qui adoptatus est. Sardus commeth nearer the marke, This name (saith he) is of such excellency, that no man knoweth it, that is, the value and worth of it, but he who is adopted by God.Rupert. in Apoc. Cui ne∣mo scit nisi qui accipit? quia nominis ejus scientiam non alterius extrin∣secus documen∣tum, sed pro∣prium interius efficit experi∣mentum, ideo nemo scit nisi quem spiritus regenerando fi∣lium Dei effe∣cerit, & ipsâ re∣generatione scientem ejus rei doctumque suo tactu effe∣cerit. Rupertus hitteth it; Why (saith he) doth no man know this name sa∣ving he that receiveth it? Because this name cannot be knowne by any outward document, but by an inward experiment; not by externall evidence, but by in∣ward sense: therefore no man knoweth it saving he whom the Spirit by rege∣neration maketh the sonne of God, and by the same act maketh him know it. There is a great difference betweene a contemplative and an experimentall knowledge of the priviledges of Gods children. A blind man from his birth may heare the theory of the Sun read unto him, but he can never con∣ceive rightly of the beauty of that glorious lamp of heaven, or take the hun∣dreth part of that delight which we doe who see it. The discourse of the Jewish Rabbins concerning the delicacy of this Manna in my text is sweet, but nothing to the taste of it. The meditations of Divines upon the joyes of heaven are able to ravish the soule with delight, yet are they nothing to St.2. Cor. 12.2. Pauls rapture into the third heaven: so farre experimentall knowledge in particular exceedeth contemplative in generall. Out of this experimentall knowledge the Spouse testifieth,Cant. 5 1. I have eaten my hony combe, with my ho∣ny. To this the Prophet David inviteth,Psal. 34.8. O taste and see how gracious the Lord is. For this the Apostle prayeth, that the Philippians might abound in all spirituall wisedome andPsal. 1.9. . experience, or sense: and this is the knowledge here meant. You have heard the lessons set in the lines of my text; what remaineth but that according to my proposed method I direct you to foot the spiritu∣all dance accordingly?
1 And in the stone a new name. Mutatio nominis mutatio hominis,Applicat. a new name should carry with it a new man. When God changedGen. 32.28. Jacobs name into Israel he changed his condition: and certainely Christ giveth this new name to none, to whom he giveth not withall a new nature. If therefore we expect that Christ should write this new name in a white stone, and give it us; let us give all diligence that the image of the new man may shine in our soules; otherwise, if the old Adam be young in us, if our old infirmities be strong in us, if the old leven puffing us up with pride, and sowring the whole lumpe of our nature is still in us; if our old corruptions, be they vi∣tious, or ambitious, or a varitious, or superstitious, still master us, this white stone here mentioned will prove a black stone to us, and this new name written in it a hand-writing against us. For aSalvianus de provid. l. 4. Re∣atus impii pium nomen. & l. 3. Quid est in quo nobis de Christiano no∣mine blandia∣mur, cum uti∣que hoc ipso magis per no∣men sacratissi∣mum rei simus quod a sancti∣moniâ discre∣pamus? holy and godly title in a wicked man improveth the guilt of his sinne. This new name is the title of the Son of God, which appellation should bind us to our good behaviour, that we carry our selves so in private to∣wards God, so in publike towards men, so holily in our devotion, so faith∣fully in our vocation, so uprightly in our conversation, that we may be Proles tanto non inficianda parenti, children not unworthy to be owned by such a Father, who hath adopted us in Christ. What a shame is it for a Prince, or the sonne of a Noble man to filch and cheat, and take base courses, and live sordidly? Tertullian strongly refuteth Montanus his prophecies by his personall infirmities; What? (saith he) a Prophet, and a Dicer? a Prophet, and an Usurer? a Prophet, and fleshly given? a Prophet, and distemper himselfe with drinke? Wee may streigne this string higher, What? a Christian beleever, and a Pagan liver? the Sonne of God, and doe the workes of the Divell? the childe of light, and walke in darknesse, in gluttony, chambering and wanton∣nesse, strife and envying? an heire of heaven, and all his mind and thoughts upon the mucke and dung of the earth? Why dost thou reproach thine owneBasil seleuc. Cur appellati∣oni cujus virtu∣te cares contu∣melium irro∣gas? quid gestas cognomen? quid personae probro sit? quid factis appela∣tionem impug∣nas, & calumniâ nomen tuum afficis? name? Why dost thou disgrace thy greatest honour? Why dost thou overthrow thine owne title by thy deeds? 3 If Christ hath written our new name in a white stone, let us imprint his name in our hearts, as Ignatius did, and that so deepely, if we may be∣leeve the Legend, that the characters thereof were legible in it after his death: let us sing a new song to him that hath given us this new name. 4 If no man upon earth know to whom Christ hath given this white stone saving he that receiveth it, let us take heed how we suddenly write a∣ny mans name in a blacke stone, I meane passe the censure of Reprobates upon them. TheMat. 7.1. Judge himselfe adviseth not to judge, lest we be judged. The foundation of God remaineth sure, having this seale, God knoweth who are his, not we: we ought to labour for the reformation, and pray for the con∣version, and hope for the salvation of any to whom God, for ought we know, may give repentance unto life, as he hath given to us: They cannot be worse than we have beene.Cypr. ep. l. 3. Nemo id sibi arroget quod sibi soli reser∣vat pater. Let no man arrogantly assume that to himselfe which the Father hath reserved to himselfe alone, viz. the fanne to sever the wheate from the chaffe in Christs floore.
5 Lastly, if we desire to eat of the hidden Manna, let us loathe the flesh∣pots of Egypt; if we covet this white stone, let us value it above all preci∣ous stones; if we expect this new name, let us contemne the titles of the world: let us study lesse other mens titles and states on earth, and more our owne state in Gods promises, and title to heaven: let us view in the glasse of holy Scripture the true markes of Gods children, and seeke to find them all in our selves. So shall we be sure before death closeth up our eies, to have a sight of this new name here, and after we remove hence to read it writ∣ten in glorious characters in the gates and walls of the new Jerusalem, de∣scending from God, whoseApoc. 21.19. streets are paved with gold, and the gates and foundations of the walls garnished with pearles and all sorts of precious stones: into which heavenly Mansions, when we are ready for them, God receive us for his sake, who is gone thither before to prepare them for us. To whom, &c.
SATANAE STRATAGEMATA. THE XXIX. SERMON. 2 COR. 2.11. Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his de∣vices. Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. SCaliger hath long since set forth an excellent worke de e∣mendatione temporum, but wee need rather bookes de e∣mendatione morum. For in this Chrisis of distempered hu∣mours, such is the condition of most hearers, that the Minister of God, though upon good warrant from his text, can hardly rebuke the publike enemies of Church or State, but hee shall procure private enemies to himselfe. Every one is jealous that something is said or meant by our Pauls against his great Dia∣na. If he stand for, or be inclinable unto the new, or newly taken up expres∣sions of devotion, he suspects the Preacher glanceth at him under the name of a temporizer, or symbolizer with Papists. If hee bee averse from such customes and rites, hee conceiveth himselfe to bee taxed under the name of a refractary Non-conformitant. If hee make any great shew of religi∣on, hee thinkes himselfe pointed at in the reproofe of an Hypocrite; if lit∣tle or no shew, hee feeles himselfe galled in the reprehension of the pro∣phane worldling. If hee rellish the leaven of Arminius, he takes himselfe to bee wounded through the Pelagians; if of Cartwright, through the Brow∣nists; if of Cassander, or the Catholike Moderatour, through the luke∣warme Laodicean sides. Yet I have met with an enemy, through whose sides I am sure no man will hold himselfe wounded, whose part no man will take, whose quarrels no man will owne, against whom it is lawfull to cast not onely fiery, but also poysoned darts, Tincta Lycambaeo spicula felle—
whom to particularize is discretion; to stigmatize, moderation; to curse to the deepe pit of hell, piety; to hate with a perfect hatred, the top of Chri∣stian charity: I meane the grand enemy of mankind, whose name and spi∣rituall snares you heare of in the reading of my text; but through Gods helpe shall see, and handle them, and pull them asunder in the explication and application thereof. Plut. in A∣poph. Optimus ille est Impera∣tor qui maxi∣mè cognitas habet res hosti∣um. Et Eras. ap. l. 5.Chabryas was wont to say, that hee was the best Commander in warre who best understood his enemies. For knowing wherein their strength con∣sisted, he could prepare against it; and being acquainted with the maner of their fight, he could discipline his souldiers accordingly; and having good in∣telligence what courses they meant to take, hee could prevent them there∣in, and alwayes worke upon the advantage. As in all other sciences and arts, so in the military profession there are certaine axiomes, maximes, or generall rules: whereof the first is,Vegetius de re milit. l. 3. c. 26. Quicquid tibi prodest ad∣versario nocet, quicquid illum juva, tibi sem∣per officit. Whatsoever is good for our ene∣mies is alwayes hurtfull to us; for his gaine is our losse, his rise is our fall, his honour is our infamy, his helpe is our hinderance, his devices are our snares, his plots are our traps, his inventions are our circumventions. Wherefore it cannot but be a matter of great importance to all that fight under the ban∣ner of Christs crosse against Satan and all his infernall forces, to bee infor∣med out of Scripture, and the observations of the best experienced souldi∣ers in our spirituall warfare, wherein our ghostly enemies strength lyeth, after what manner hee assaulteth us, and what are his usuall stratagems whereby hee most prevaileth; ut praemoniti, simus praemuniti, that being forewarned of them, wee way bee forearmed against them. To which end, among others, I pitched my serious thoughts upon this passage of Scrip∣ture; wherein one of Christs Worthies, who in his time fought many noble battailes, and was more than conquerour in them all, advertiseth the Corin∣thians of a designe that Satan had upon them, viz. by the rigour of their se∣verity to cast away one of the members of their Church, whom they had cast out of their congregation for his incestuous match.Occas. There was great reason the Elders and Governours at Corinth should be exasperated against this delinquent,Cal com. in 2 ad Cor. qui primus nitorem ecclesiae tam turpi notâ maculasset, who was the first that blemished that Virgin Spouse of Christ: and therefore having received warrant from the Apostle to proceed against him, they draw out their sharpe sword of excommunication, and presently cut him off from their assemblies; never thinking they could doe enough to manifest to the world their detestation of so foule a fact, and fouler a scandale. Here∣upon the common adversary worketh, hardening their hearts more and more by a colourable pretence of zeale, and locking up their eares against the prayers, and shutting their eyes at the teares and lowest submission of this disconsolate penitent; that so hee being out of all hope of restituti∣on to his former state, might runne some desperate course. And very like it was that Satan would have gone beyond them all, had not the Apostle de∣scried this his subtle device, and discovered it unto them in this clause of his letter, which carryeth this sense: Paraphr.My beloved brethren at Corinth, it grieveth mee to write any thing to you to grieve you, who are the crowne of my joy; and therefore I wrote heretofore more smartly against him who troubled you, that I might make
a trial of your love towards me, in vindicating the honor of your Church, my plantation; and you have abundantly testified your obedience to me, and zeale for the Gospel, by putting him from among you, who brought an obloquy upon you, and blasted the fruits of my labours. But now the case is much altered, hee is not what hee was, he swelleth not with pride, but is fallen away with griefe, and will undoubtedly sinke in despaire, if you reach not out your hand of compassion to save him from drowning in a sea of salt teares. Wherefore things standing thus with him, let my pen which gave the wound, heale it; and if upon my former letter, to shew your obedience to mee, you bound him with an anathema to con∣firme the same, upon this letter release him: Una eadem{que} manus vulnus opem{que} ferat. If I forgave others for your sake, forgive him now for my sake, or at least for your owne sake, lest the common adversary make an advantage of your zeale for the Church, to maime it; and abuse that power which God hath given you for edification, to the destruction of one, who before was, and after reparation may bee a living Temple of the holy Ghost. The words containe in them a wise prevention of a subtle circumventi∣on; wherein I observe 1 A caution,Divis. 2 A reason. The caution most seasonable, lest Satan should get an advantage. The reason most forcible, for wee are not ignorant of his devices. In the former wee are to take speciall notice, 1 Of the caveat put in, ne circumveniat. 2 Of the party against whom it is put in, Satanas. 3 Of the parties in whose behalfe it is put in, nos. 1 Him. 2 You. 3 Mee. The reason is drawne from two heads, 1 The cause of the danger, , They are devices. 2 The notice thereof, , Wee are not ignorant of them. First, of the caution: . Some render these words, lest Sa∣than should usurpe upon you; and they give this reason, because, say they,Theod. com. in 2 ad Cor. . Satan hath no right to any place; wheresoever hee getteth footing hee is an in∣truder and usurper: like Antiochus surnamed Hierax, the Hawke, who had no estate or patrimony left him, but preyed upon others territories, and by rapine patched out a kingdome to himselfe. Others read, lest Satan cir∣cumvent
us, agreeably to the circumstances of the place, and the practice of the devill; who being demanded by God,Job. 1.7. from whence he came, answered, from compassing the earth; & cur circuit, nisi ut circumveniat? why doth he compasse the earth, but to circumvent us? Circumvention is more easily understood, than prevented or avoided. A Wrestler who can circumvenire, come about his adversary, taketh hold where hee list to his best advantage: in a duell fought on horse-backe, hee that can nimbly turne his beast, and circumvenire, come about his Antagonist, hee striketh him at pleasure: when a passenger is met by a theefe at every turne, he is properly circum∣vented: when a city is environed and begirt with a puissant army, that is circumvented, there is no hope to escape. By which few instances you may perceive how apt this phrase is to expresse the great danger of Satan his temptations. Yet the Kings Translation (lest Satan get advantage of us) commeth neerest to the Greeke Etymology, which imports, to have more or the better, to gaine over and above: and Oecumenius the Greeke Scho∣liast descanteth upon this signification of the word after this manner:Oecumenius in 2 Cor. 2.11. ; Doth not Satan gaine over and above, when hee gaines upon us both wayes, when hee getteth an advantage of us both by sinne and repentance, both by vitious pleasures, and by godly sorrow? as hee would have done upon this Corin∣thian, whom first hee perswaded to make an incestuous match, to satisfie his lustfull desires; and after hee felt the smart of his sinne, and severe cen∣sure of the Church, hee wrought upon his sorrow, and sought to drive him into desparation. But why doth the Apostle say, lest hee get advantage of us? was Saint Paul in any danger, or had Satan any designe upon him? We may piously conceive that Saint Paul joynes himselfe with them, because hee esteemed all those whom hee begot to Christ by the Gospell, no other than his own children; and the Father cannot but suffer in the losse of his childe. TheCypr. de laps. Plus pastor in gregis sui vul∣nere vulnera∣tur. shepheard must needs be endamaged when any of his flocke is diminished.2 Cor. 11.29 Who is offended, saith Saint Paul, and I burne not? yet this is not all, Saint Paul was further interessed in this businesse than so: for the Corinthians had excommunicated this incestuous person by order from the Apostle himselfe, and therefore if he had miscarried, Satan had made his advantage upon all: upon the incestuous person, whose soule hee would have ruined; upon the Church, which hee had maimed of a member; upon the Corinthi∣ans, and S. Paul himselfe, under whose hands this patient had beene so roughly handled, that hee died in the cure. These were Satans reaches, or as they are here called, devices; which he could not carry so closely, but that the Apostles vigilant eye descryed them: for, saith hee, Wee are not ignorant of his devices. Did the housholder know what night the thiefe would come to rob him, he would certainly guard his house: did the birds know a snare were laid for them, would they come neare it? were the fishes aware that a net were spread for them, would they run into it? had the souldiers certaine notice of an ambush set for them, would they bee surprized? Loe here, beloved, snares of temptation, nets of circumventi∣on, ambushes of destruction, prepared by a most subtle enemy, and wee are not ignorant of them; if then we be taken, entangled, or surprized, can we lay the blame upon any thing but upon our carelesse and retchlesse fol∣ly?
Could wee plead with him in the Poet, Non expectato vulnus ab hoste tuli; I was wounded by a dart I was not aware of, our case deserved some com∣passion: but when wee know our enemy, and are foreshewed what fiery darts hee prepareth for us, and when and how hee will cast them at us, if we receive our deaths wound, our blood must needs bee upon our selves. Satan assaults us two maner of waies, by his lions paw, & by his serpents sting; by open force, and by cunning sleights; by the one in time of persecu∣tion, by the other in time of peace: of the latter the Apostle here speaks, say∣ing, wee are not ignorant of his Devices. Devices are subtle meanes to compasse our ends, such as are trickes in gaming, fallacies in disputing, sleights in wrestling, mysteries in trading, policies in state, and stratagems in war; the enemy of our soule is full of them: —cui nomina mille, Mille nocendi artes.— Lypsius hath written of all the warlike engines used by the ancients, and Ve∣getius of their military policies and Captaine-craft; but never any yet was able to recount, much lesse describe all Satans poliorcetickes and stratagems. Some of the chief and most dangerous, partly out of scripture, and partly out of experienced souldiers of Christ, I purpose to acquaint you with at this time. 1. The first stratagem, policy, or device of Satan is, To observe the na∣turall constitution of every mans minde and body, and to fit his temptations thereunto. For hee knoweth well, that as every plant thrives not in every soyle, so neither every vice in every temper and complexion. Though there bee in every man a generall aversenesse from good, and propension to evill; and albeit nature, as it is corrupted since the fall, bee a step-dame to all vertue, and a mother to all vices, yet shee is not equally affected in eve∣ry one, to all her owne children. Some ill conditions are more incident to some climats, to some countries, to some families, than others. The Ea∣sterne people were for the most part given to sorcery, the auncient Jewes to idolatry, the Greeks to curious heresie, the Latine Church to superstition. Unnaturall lust seemeth to bee naturalized in Italy, pride in Spaine, levity in France, drunkennesse in Germany, gluttony and new fangled fashions in great Brittaine. Ambition haunteth the Court mostly, faction the Univer∣sity, luxury and usury the City, oppression and extortion the Countrey, bribery and forged cavillations the Courts of justice, schisme and simony the Church. Pliny writeth of some families, that they had privie marks in their bodies, peculiar to those of that line; the like may bee found in mens mindes: and every one herein is like the Leopard, Cognatis maculis parcit fera: heeGreg. mor. in Job. l. 29. Priùs conspersionem uniuscujus{que} intuctur, & pòst tentatio∣num laqueos apponit. favoureth his owne spots. These spots Satan curiously marketh, and accordingly frames his suggestions: hee observes our walkes, and spies our usuall haunts, and there sets gins for us. As the Mariner marks the wind, and
accordingly hoiseth up or striketh saile: or as the cunning Oratour learneth which way the Judge propendeth, and ever draweth him where hee seeth him comming on; so the Devill maketh perpetuall use of the bent of our nature to helpe forward his temptations, rightly considering that it is a very easie matter to bow a tree the way it bendeth of it selfe, to cast a bowle swiftly downe the hill, to push downe a wall where it swaggeth already, to trip up his heeles whose foot is sliding. Hee would finde it a matter of some difficulty to tempt a flegmaticke man to quarrelling and contention, a cholericke man to sloath and sluggishnesse, a melan∣choly man to excesse of mirth, a man of a sanguine complexion to over much sorrow, because the byas of their constitution carryeth them to the contrary affections. What then doth this crafty Sinon? hee creepeth into the bosome of the cholericke man, by adding fuell to his naturall fire, and whetting his desire of revenge; of the sanguine, by preparing a sweet bit for his liquorish taste; of the flegmaticke, by making a downe bed for him to sleepe in it securely; of the melancholy, by opening a spring to pensive thoughts, and driving him along upon a full streame of sorrow into the gulfe of despaire. 2. The second stratagem, policy, or device is, To observe our naturall abilities and endowments, and accommodate his temptations thereunto. Like a cunning Poet hee fits every actour with a part agreeable. Ex quolibet lig∣no non fit Mercurius, Every piece of timber will not serve to carve Mercu∣ry on; neither is every man fit to make an Arch-traytour or Hereticke. He that will bee the ring-leader of rebellion, had need bee a man of great parts and power. Such was Jeroboam in Israel, Cyrus the younger in the Per∣sian state, Arbaces in the Assyrian, Alcibiades and Themistocles in the Athe∣nian, Hannibal in the Carthaginian, the Gracchi, and Marius, and Cinna, and Sylla, and Catiline in the Romane state. None but a man of a curious wit, and a prying Spirit into the secrets of nature, would busie himselfe in a∣strologicall and magicall speculations: Satan therefore finding Zoroastres of old, and Cornelius Agrippa of late, fitted for this purpose, used their braines and pennes, under the title of naturall magicke, or hidden philoso∣phy, to commend sorcery, figure-casting, and negromancy to the world. When Absalom went about to dispossesse his Father, a wise and puissant Prince, of his kingdome, hee needed a man of a deeper reach than his owne to be his Counseller: therefore Satan sends him Achitophel, the cunningest Politician that age afforded, whose ungodly Maximes and state Apho∣rismes, fit for no Court but Lucifers in hell, passed by tradition for the most part, till that Florentine monster Nicolaus Machiavel committed them to writing. The invention and maintenance of heresie is no work of a dull wit or illiterate apprehension; which the Father of lies and all falshood under∣standing, employed the subtilest Philosophers to devise and defend im∣pious novelties against the Orthodoxe faith. In which regard Tertullian fitly tearmeth Philosophers the Patriarches of Heretickes; from whom we may derive the pedegree of Arrius, and Sabellius, and Coelestius, and Pelagi∣us, the fragments of whose works yet extant in the Fathers writings, shew the subtlety of their wits, and their excellent skill in sophistry. Neither was Servetus much inferiour to Arrius, nor Socinus to Coelestius, nor Gentilis to
Sabellius, nor Arminius to Pelagius, who in our dayes have uttered some of their wares at second hand, setting onely a new glosse of words upon them. As Phillis in the Poet pitifully complaineth against Demophoon for flying away from her in the fleet of ships shee furnished him withall: Ovid op Phil. Demophoonti.Remigium{que} dedi quo me fugiturus abires: Heu patior telis vulnera facta meis. so the Church and University have just cause to exclaime against her owne children of eminent parts, that they have given her the deepest wounds by those weapons of art and authority wherewith shee armed them. The third stratagem, policy or device of Satan is, To accommodate his temptations to mens outward estate, condition, and place; which much swayeth either way. For you shall seldome heare of a man in high honour hum∣ble, or in disgrace proud; in prosperity distrustfull, or in extreme misery hopefull; in wealth discontent, or in poverty patient; in abundance tempe∣rate, or in want luxurious; in health and strength mortified, or in sicknesse lustfull. Had not the Philosopher, in the second of his Rhetorickes, taught us what impressions these outward things make upon the minde, we might have read it in the Greeke and Latine proverbs, , Honores mutant mores. Who knoweth not that tyranny is often incident to sove∣raignty, ambition to nobility, oppression to power, insolency to wealth, and luxury to abundance, as contrary vices to contrary fortunes? Whereup∣on the subtle spye of mankinde suggesteth evill motions, agreeable as well to our outward estate as our inward qualities: hee shooteth his poysoned ar∣rowes alwayes with the winde, that they may bee carried with a double force, the motion of the ayre and the strength of his arme; and hard it is if he prevaile not, when both our natural temper and parts, and our outward con∣dition and calling helpe forward his attempts against us. Adam was no soo∣ner made by God a Prince on earth, but he tempteth him to aspire higher, even to bee like God himselfe the King of heaven; and this temptation ta∣keth, because it well suted with Adams present honour and happinesse. Nimrod was a mighty man, Satan therefore tempteth him to violence and tyranny; and his temptation taketh, because it met with a fit subject. Ne∣buchadnezzar was a great, puissant, and magnificent Prince, Satan there∣fore tempteth him to pride and vaine-glory; and this temptation taketh, be∣cause it was sutable to the high quality of that Monarch. Joab was a great Commander in warre, Satan therefore tempteth him to a bloody revenge on Abner his competitor; and this temptation taketh, because it fitted so well Joabs profession and present discontent. Haman was King Asuerus his favourite, and could ill brooke any to rise in the Kings Court, Satan therefore tempteth him to envie Mardocheus, and lay a plot to destroy him and all the Jewish nation; and this temptation taketh, because it sorted well with the proud stomacke of that Princes Minion. To conclude with the worst of all men, Judas; Satan saw that hee had the bagge, and was basely covetous, repining at any extraordinary expence, even upon his Masters person, therefore hee tempteth him by mony to betray his Master; and this temptation took, because it so well agreed with Judas his disposition
and employment. Eutrapeles, as it seemeth, had good experience how mens inward mindes changed with their outward garbe: for, —Cuicun{que} nocere volebat Vestimenta dabat pretiosa: if he had aspleen at any, and intended to ruine them, he sent them rich & cost∣ly apparrel; not doubting but after they had put it on, they would withall take upon them, and by their insolent carriage bring themselves into danger. We cannot but smile when we read of Bucephalus, that when he had on his rich caparisons, and held his golden bit between his teeth, he would suffer none to mount upon him but Alexander; but when he was out of his costly trap∣pings any Page or Lackey might backe him. Have wee not greater reason, I will not say to laugh at, but to pitty the folly of most men, who, accor∣ding to the words of the Psalmist,Psal. 49.20. being in honour have no understanding, but may bee compared to the beast that perisheth? Their purple robes are no sooner on but they reflect upon their owne worth and wisedome, and tram∣ple those who were before their equals, under foot. 4. The fourth stratagem, policie, or device is, To tempt us by method, beginning with questionable actions, thence proceeding to sinnes of infir∣mity, from them to wilfull transgressions, after to heinous crimes, and last of all to obstinacy and finall impenitency. No wooll or cloath is dyed pur∣ple or scarlet at the first, but after divers tinctures, at the last taketh that deepest dye: so doth the soule scarlet and crimson sinnes, after many lesser faults of an inferiour dye or staine. Juven. Sat. 2Nemo repentè fuit turpissimus: No man at one leap gets up to the top of all impiety: therefore Satan takes him by the hand and leads him by these severall steps; 1 An evill motion, plot, or designe. 2 The entertainment of it with some kind of approbation. 3 A determination to pursue it. 4 A vitious action. 5 An evill habit or custome. 6 The defence or justification of his wicked course. 7 Glorying in it, and in a reprobate sense. Hee that hastily turnes the pegge to winde up a treble to his pitch, will sooner breake the string than tune it; but if hee straine it up by little and lit∣tle, hee bringeth it without danger to the height. Had Satan at the first dash tempted Saint Peter to forsweare his Master, and curse himselfe, doubtlesse the Apostle would have abandoned the suggestion, and defied the tempter; who yet wrought upon him by degrees, and at length obtained his end. First hee cooleth his zeale, perswading him not to runne upon danger; but if he were resolved to see what would become of his Master, to follow him afar off: when hee comes slowly to the high Priests pallace, hee sets a damo∣sell
upon him to question him, and upon a light apprehension of danger he gaines from him an unadvised deniall; after, upon greater feare, a double and treble abnegation; in conclusion an oath, to make good his former de∣nials. If this grand Impostor of the world, and cunning supplanter of soules meet with a man of a strict conscience, who endevoureth to walke upright∣ly before God; first he tryeth to bring him to venture upon questionable actions, such things as may beare a dispute whether they are sinnes or no, as statute usury (to take eight in the hundred): legall simony (to buy the next advowson of a living, the Incumbent lying desperately sicke): customary sacriledge (to pay a certaine rate for the tithe, though far lesse in value than the due.) If hee get thus much ground of him, hee easily presseth him for∣ward to commit some undoubted sinnes, but small in the kinde; as to let his eyes range about vaine objects, to entertaine a wanton thought for a while, to keepe from Church in foule weather, to salve a fault with a hansome ex∣cuse, to mis-spend an houre or two with a friend in a Taverne: after Satan hath gained thus much of him, hee will easily draw him from making little account of small sinnes, to make small account of great. For as the wimble bores a hole for the auger, so lesse sinnes make way for greater; idlenesse for wantonnesse, lust for adultery, wrath for murder, lying for perjury, er∣rours for heresies, good fellowship for drunkennesse and all wickednesse. Milo by carrying a calfe at the first, and after a bullocke, was able in fine to beare an oxe. And it is storied of Mithridates King of Pontus, that by ta∣king weak poysons at the first, & by degrees stronger, in the end he brought his body to that temper, that no poyson could worke upon him. Effecit poto Mithridates saepe veneno, Toxica ne possint saeva nocere sibi. Thus custome in small sinnes at the first, and in greater after, makes us in the end insensible of all. This rule of Satans method extendeth farther than private corruption in mens mindes. For thus sensim sine sensu, tyranny, he∣resie, and superstition overran the greater part of the Church. The Bishop of Rome in the beginning contended but for a bare primacy of order, which considering the great power of that City, being the seat of the Empire, was without much difficulty yeelded unto him: after hee pretends to a lit∣tle more, viz. receiving the last appeales from the sentence of the other Patriarchs; this Sozimus stickled for, alledging for it a Canon of the Coun∣cell of Nice, which the African Bishops proved to be forged. By Boniface the third his time he durst to put in for the title of Universall Bishop, which hee obtained, thoughPlat. in. Bo∣nif. 3. An. 666. with much adoe, through the Emperour Phocas his meanes, who murdered his Master Mauritius. By vertue of this title his successour Vitalianus tooke upon him to give spirituall lawes to the whole Church; and after him Pope Hildebrand to give temporall lawes to Kings and Princes, to depose them at pleasure, and to dispose of their crownes. As tyranny, so superstition and Idolatry stole pedetentim into the Church. First to confirme Christians in the faith of the resurrection, and to encourage them to constancy in their holy profession, in the Church Liturgy there was some commemoration made of the dead; after this com∣memoration
succeeded anniversary panegyrickes in their commendation soone after, publike giving thankes to God for them by name; and last of all, direct invocation of them. In like manner grosse Idolatry crept into the Church. First images and pictures of Saints were used in private for me∣mory, history, or ornament onely; after, upon the like colour of pretence in St.Epist. ex Re∣gist. 9 Adorate Imagins om∣nibus modis devita. Gregories dayes they were brought into the Church, with an ex∣presse prohibition of worshipping them. In the next age the worship of them was enjoyned by Pope Adrian in the second Synod at Nice; yet not for themselves, but respectively onely in regard of that which they repre∣sent: but now in our age, since the Councell of Trent, it is the tenent of the Roman Church, that Images are to be worshipped for themselves,Bell. de imag. sanct. l. 2. c. 21. Ut in se considerantur, non tantum ut vicem gerunt exemplaris; and far∣ther the Heathen goe not in their Idolatry, nor the wiser of them so farre. 5 The fift stratagem, policy or device of Satan is to bring us from one ex∣treme to another: when our heart smiteth us for any grievous sinne out of detestation thereof, unlesse we walke circumspectly we are easily carried to the opposite vice. With this engine Satan maketh great batteries upon ma∣ny weake Christians, not onely because it is a hard thing to hit the middle, but because we are apt to thinke that the extremest opposition to that vice which lieth heaviest upon our conscience is the worke of grace in us, not considering that vices are not only opposed to vertues, but to vices also. Our way to heaven is like the course of a ship in the Sicilian sea betweene two rockes called the Symplegades, the one lying on the right hand, the o∣ther on the left; betweene which the channell is so narrow, that few seeke to decline the one but they dash on the other. Incidit in Scillam qui vult vitare Charybdim. As those that goe upon ropes, or passe over a narrow bridge, if they be not exceeding carefull, when the body swayeth or the foot slippeth one way, by hastily leaning too far the other way they fall irrecoverably: so if we be not very watchfull over our wayes, in declining one vitious extremity, ere we are aware we passe the middle, and are upon the other. I need not goe farre for an instance; this Corinthian, before he fell into this snare of Satan, was puft up in pride, and sinned presumptuously; but after the heavie cen∣sure of the Church for his incestuous marriage, and the remorse of his owne conscience for it, he fell into the contrary extreme, took on so far, and plun∣ged himselfe into so deepe sorrow, that he was in great danger to be swal∣lowed up in the gulfe of despaire. Demea offended not so much in rigour to∣wards his children at the the first, as afterwards in indulgency when he felt the smart of his own rod. None usually so exceed in mirth, and run into that riot of pleasure as melancholy men when they are out of that humour. This stratagem serves Satans turne as well in matter of faith as maners. For as vi∣ces are in both extremes, and vertue in the middle; so oftentimes errours in doctrine are in both extremes and truth in the middle: by over-reaching against one heresie we wrong the truth, hurt our selves, and fall upon the errour in the other extreme. St.V  t. Cg ca J Regis. Basil in his heat of opposition to Sabelli∣us his heresie, was transported so farre, that he came within the Verge of the
opposite heresie, and uttered some inconvenient speeches concerning the Trinity. St. Austine likewise in his zeale against the Pelagians, who sleight∣ned baptisme, went too farre in urging the necessity thereof, pronouncing all children that died unbaptized to be damned. And how many are there among us, who out of hatred of the Antichristian tyranny, condemne all Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy? out of detestation of superstitious rites, dislike even decent ceremonies? in opposition to garish and idolatrous trimming of Temples, are brought to dis-allow all cost in adorning and beautifying Christian Churches? 6 The sixt stratagem, policy or device of Satan is to turne himselfe into an Angell of light, and thereby to perswade the children of light that his suggestions are the motions of Gods holy Spirit. This he attempteth and often effecteth by observing what gifts and graces are most eminent in Gods children, and to what actions of piety or charity they are most ad∣dicted, and subtilly, under the colour and resemblance of these, drawing them to those neighbour vices that seeme to have most affinity with their Christian perfections: like as if a cunning Lapidarie should insinuate into the company of a rich Merchant, and getting a sight of his cabbinet of Jewels, should cheat him with counterfeit stones in stead of them. To dis∣cover this plot of Satan more apparently: 1 Religion is a true jewell, Superstition a counterfeit: 2 Humility a jewell, Pusillanimity a counterfeit: 3 Spirituall wisedome a jewell, Worldly policy a counterfeit: 4 Magnificence a jewell, Prodigality a counterfeit: 5 Tendernesse of conscience a jewell, Scrupulosity a counterfeit: 6 Severity a jewell, Cruelty a counterfeit: 7 Clemency a jewell, Indulgence a counterfeit: 8 Zeale a jewell, Indiscreet fervour a counterfeit: 9 Diligent search into divine mysteries a jewell, curiosity a coun∣terfeit: 10 Inward peace a jewell, Carnall security a counterfeit: 11 Confidence in God a jewell, Presumption a counterfeit: 12 Constancy a jewell, Pertinacy a counterfeit. Here then is Satans masterpiece, to rob us of our precious jewels of grace, and deceive us with counterfeit in their roome; by name, to adulterate and sophisticate the former vertues by the later vices: 1 Religion by Superstition. 2 Humility by Pusillanimity. 3 Spirituall wisedome by Policy. 4 Magnificence by Prodigality. 5 Tendernesse of conscience by Scrupulosity. 6 Severity by Cruelty. 7 Clemency by Indulgence. 8 Zeale by Indiscreet fervour. 9 Diligence by Curiosity.
10 Inward peace by Carnall security. 11 Confidence by Presumption. 12 Constancy by Pertinacy. Saul was most zealous for the law of Moses: this his fervour Satan infla∣ming enraged him against the Apostles and Disciples, whom he as then thought to be capitall enemies to the law: in this his rage hee makes havocke of the Church of God, deeming that he could not doe better ser∣vice to God, than to be an instrument to put to death the dearest servants of Christ. The great love St. Cyprian the Martyr bare to the Orthodoxe faith, and the Professours thereof, bred in him a vehement detestation of Heresie and Heretikes: upon this Satan works, and draweth him by degrees to question, then to condemn their baptism, and lastly to presse the necessity of rebaptizing those that were baptized by them. Theodosius his infinite de∣sire of the Church's peace was a most commendable and Christian vertue in him; yet Satan made his advantage of it, working him to some connivence at the Arrians, which much prejudiced the Orthodoxe Professours. Who can sufficiently extoll Constantine the great his love to Bishops and Church∣men? yet Satan abused this his pious respect to the Clergie, in such sort that when divers Bishops brought inditements one against another, for a∣dultery and other foule crimes, he never so much as looked upon their pa∣pers, but presently burned them, saying, that rather than any should espie the nakednesse of those his spirituall Fathers, he would cast his Princely robe over them to cover them. Whosoever readeth the story of St. Monica, would thinke that a sonne could never doe too much for such a mother, who took so much pains, and shed so many tears for his conversion. Neither was she more carefull for him, than he thankfull to her: and would you thinke that Satan could sucke poyson out of so sweet a flower as is filiall obedience to a gracious mother? yet he doth by inducing St. Austine to pray for her soule after she was dead. How was he brought to this? Did he beleeve that his mothers soule was in Purgatory, or that she needed any prayer? That conceit he disclaimeth in the very same place where he prayeth for her, Credo quod jam feceris quod te rogo, sed voluntaria oris mei opproba Domine. ForAug. Confes. l. 9. c. 13. my mother on her death-bed desired but this one thing of me, that I would remember her in my devotions at thine Altar. 7 The seventh stratagem, policy or device of Satan is to make advan∣tage of time, not only by alluring every age to the peculiar vices thereof, as children to idlenesse and vanity, youth to lust, perfect age and strength to violence and audacious attempts, old age to covetousnesse, and every one to the sinnes of the time: but making use of the present opportunity to thrust a man suddenly into the next sinne. When he had got Christ upon the pi∣nacle of the Temple, he tempteth him to cast himselfe downe from it, to make experience of the Angels care and diligence in waiting on him, andMat. 4.6. bearing him in their hands, that hee dash not his foot against a stone. As soone as David had spied faire Bathsheba bathing her selfe, he cast a fiery dart of lust at him, and wounded him at the heart. Achans eyes were no sooner dazled with the lustre of the rich Babylonish garment, but Sa∣tan closeth with him. And as by taking advantage of the present occa∣sion
hee made Achan a theefe, so Gyges an adulterer, Ananias and Sap∣phira lyers to the holy Ghost, Judas a murderer of himselfe. If ever a Christian is like to be in any great distresse and trouble in minde, it is either in the travels of his new birth, or when hee laboureth for life at his last gaspe; therefore Satan at these times is most busie. In the beginning of our conversion nature is strong, and grace is weake, and the practise of religious duties is uncouth unto us; then therefore Satan sets upon us, and presents to us all our former pleasures, and amplifieth upon the austerity of a Chri∣stian course of life. At the houre of death hee doubleth his files, not onely because hee is streightned in time, and knoweth that either then hee is to prevaile, or never; but because many things helpe his temptation, viz. the extremity of pain, the naturall terrour of death, and apprehension of Christs dreadfull tribunall, before which the sicke party is presently to appeare. Now therefore hee sets upon a man in his greatest weaknesse of body, and consternation of minde; he chargeth him with all his sinnes secret and open, hee exaggerateth the strictnesse of Gods justice, and the unsufferable tor∣ments of hell: and if the dying man hath not prepared himselfe for this last conflict, or hath not on the whole armour of God, or cannot weild his buckler of faith, to quench all the fiery darts of the Devill, it is great ods that hee wi l get the upper hand of him, and bring him, if not to dye desperately, yet most uncomfortably. To launch out of these deepes of Satan, and steere towards the haven.Conclus. & applicat. The knowledge of evill is good, of fraud is honest, of errors is true, of things that are most noxious wholesome; and therefore Logicians discourse accu∣rately of fallacies, Physitians of poysons, morall Philosophers of vices, and Divines of heresies: not that wee should use the first, or take the second, or practise the third, or professe the fourth; but that wee be not deceived by the first, annoied by the second, infected by the third, seduced by the fourth. And this was my first aime in laying before you these stratagems, policies, and devices of our ghostly enemie, to forewarne you of them, that you bee not taken or hurt by them. But my chiefe was to instruct you how to em∣ploy his owne engines, and turne his owne ordnance upon himselfe, to make treacle of his poyson, and use of serpentine wisedome against the serpent, after this manner. 1. First, doth Satan play the Physiognomer, and observing our naturall temper fit his temptations thereunto? let us also make use of Physiogno∣my, and take advantage of our naturall inclinations to further the worke of grace in us: If wee finde our selves by nature timorous, let us endevour to improve this feare into awfull reverence: if audacious, to improve this bold∣nesse into spirituall confidence: if gladsom and merry, to improve our mirth into joy in the holy Ghost: if cholericke, to improve our wrath into zeale: if melancholy, to improve our pensivenesse into godly sorrow. 2. Secondly, doth Satan play the Poet, and fit every Player with a part that hee is best able to act? let us also make use of Poetry, and observing our naturall abilities of minde and body, to fit our spirituall exercises accor∣dingly: If wee are endued with pregnancy of wit, to employ it in the stu∣dy of heavenly mysteries: if with maturity of judgement, employ it in dis∣cerning betweene the true and false Religion, and resolving intricate cases
of consciences: if with felicity of memory, employ it in treasuring up pre∣tious doctrines: if with liberty of speech, employ it in prayer, prayses and godly exhortations: if with strength of body, and courage of minde, em∣ploy them in fighting the Lords battels: if with wisdome, in prudently go∣verning the affaires in Church and Commonwealth. 3. Thirdly, doth Satan play the Politician, and enquire into every mans estate & condition of life, and accommodate his temptations there∣unto? let us also make use of policy, and by our outward estate better our inward, labouring for those graces which are most proper for our place and condition. If wee are in authority, let us strive for gravity and integrity: if under the command of others, for obedience and faithfulnesse: if in an e∣minent condition, for magnanimity and magnificence: if in a low, for mo∣desty and humility: if in abundance, for charity and thankfulnesse: if in want, for frugality and contentednesse: if in prosperity, for temperance: if in adversity, for patience. 4. Fourthly, doth Satan play the Logician, and tempt us by method? let us also make use of Logicke, and observe method in the science of salva∣tion: let us first acquaint our selves with the Catechisme, and afterwith profounder mysteries in Divinity; let us first practise easier, and after more difficult duties of Christianity; first accustome our selves to beare lighter, and after heavier crosses with patience: above all things to kill the cockatrice in the shell, nip sinnes in the bud, to resist evill motions in the be∣ginning, to make a stop at every step by which Satan leads us: not easily to bee brought to venture upon any doubtfull or questionable actions; if wee have ventured upon any, by no meanes to give consent to commit the least sinne: if wee have beene overtaken in the act of any sinne, let us take speciall care wee breake it off by speedy repentance, and make no custome of it: if through carelesnesse, or conversation with wicked men wee have gotten an ill custome, let Satan never so farre prevaile with us as to stand in de∣fence and justification thereof, much lesse to glory in our evill courses; but let our heart smite us for them, and let us never bee at peace with our selves till wee have driven out an iron nayle with a golden, an evill custome with a good. 5. Fiftly, doth Satan play the false Pilot, and by perswading us to de∣cline from a rocke on the right hand, carry us so farre the contrary way that we split our ship upon a rocke on the left hand? let us also make use of the art of navigation in our course to the faire havens in heaven: let us perfect∣ly learne our way, and all points of the Compasse, and carefully steere by the Card of Gods Word, and keepe in the streight and middle way of Gods commandements, neither declining to the right hand nor to the left. 6. Sixtly, doth Satan play the crafty Merchant, and cheate us with counterfeit stones for jewels, with shewes of vertues for true graces? let us also imitate the wisedome of Merchants, who will bee perfect Lapidaries before they deale in pearles and pretious stones: let us study the difference between true and seeming graces, and pray continually to God that we may abound more and more in knowledge, and in all judgement, that wee may bee able to discerne things that differ, and try Spirits whether they are of God or no.
7. Lastly, doth Satan play the temporizer, and time all his suggesti∣ons? let us also in a pious sense be time-servers, let us performe all holy du∣ties in the fittest season, let us omit no opportunity of doing good, let us take advantage of all occasions to glorifie God, and helpe on our eternall salva∣tion. If wee heare a bell toll, let us meditate on our end, and pray for the sicke lying at Gods mercy: if wee see an execution, let us meditate on our frailty, and reflecting upon our owne as grievous sinnes (though not com∣ming within the walke of mans justice) have compassion on our brother: if wee see Lazarus lying in the street, let us meditate upon the sores of our conscience, and our poverty in spirituall graces, and extend our charity to him: finally, sith wee know at what time Satan most assaulteth us, let us be best provided at those times, especially at the houre of our death; let us follow the advice of Seneca, though a Heathen,Sen. ep. 2. Quotidiè aliquid adversus mortem auxilii compara, & cum multa percurreris, unum excerpe quod illo die concoquas: lay up store for that day, every day gather one flower of Paradise at least, that even when the fatall houre is come, and the stench of death and rottennesse is in our nostrils, we may have a posie by us, in which wee may smell a savour of life unto life: which God grant, &c.
SERMONS PREACHED AT SAINT PAULSCROSSE, OR IN THE CHURCH.
THE BELOVED DISCIPLE. THE XXX. SERMON. JOH. 21. 20. The Disciple whom Jesus loved, which also leaned on his breast at Supper. IF wee must abstaine from all appearance of evill in our civill conversation, much more, certainly, in our reli∣gious devotion. For God is most jealous of his ho∣nour, which is all he hath from us for all we hold of him:Praef. Apolog. fest. eccles. and the streight rule of religion will in no wise bend to any obliquity on either side; either by attributing any true worship to a false, or any false worship to the true God. From both which aspersions hee that seeth not the Liturgy establi∣shed by law in the Church of England to bee most cleare and free, either is short-sighted, or looketh on her through a foule paire of spectacles; and thereby ignorantly imagineth that dust to bee in her sacred Canons and Constitutions, which indeed is not in them, but sticketh in his glassie eyes: let him but rub his spectacles and he shall see all faire, and without any the least deformity or filth of superstition, as well in the Service appointed for the Lords day, as for the Saints feasts. For though wee adorne our Ca∣lendar with the names of some eminent Saints, and make honourable men∣tion of them in our Liturgy, as the ancient Church did of her Martyrs,Austin. de civ. Dei, l. 22. c. 10. non tamen invocamus, yet wee call not upon them, wee lift not up our hands, wee bow not our knees, wee present not our offerings, wee direct not our prayers, wee intend not any part of religious worship to them, sed uni Deo
& martyrum & nostrum, but to their God and ours, as Saint Austine answe∣reth for the practice of the Church in his time. Which may serve as a buckler to beare off all those poysonous darts of calumny, which those of the concision cast at that part of our Church-service, wherein upon the yeerly returne of the Feast of the blessed Virgin, the Archangell, Apostles, Evan∣gelists, Protomartyr, Innocents, and All-holy-ones, wee remember the Saints of God; but in no wise make Gods of Saints: sanctificamus Deum, non deificamus Sanctos; wee blesse God for them, wee worship not them for God. Although our devotion glanceth by their names, yet it pitcheth and is fixed upon the Angel of the covenant, and sanctum sanctorum, the holy of all holy ones, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. On the blessed Virgins an∣niversary wee honour him in his Mother: on Saint John Baptists wee ho∣nour him in his forerunner: on Saint Michaels we honour him in his Arch∣angel (the Captaine of his celestiall squadron): on the Apostles wee ho∣nour him in his Ambassadours: on the Evangelists wee honour him in his Chroniclers: on Saint Stevens wee honour him in his Martyr: on S. John the Divine his day wee honour him in his beloved Disciple, who also lea∣ned on his breast at Supper. 1 The Disciple. 2 The Disciple beloved. 3 Beloved of Jesus. 4 In Jesus bosome. All Christians are not Disciples, this is the Disciple: all the Disciples were not beloved, this is the beloved Disciple: all that are beloved are not beloved of Jesus, this is he whom Jesus loved: lastly, all whom Jesus lo∣ved were not so familiar with him, or neare unto him, that they leaned on his breast: this was his bosome friend, and, as the text saith, at supper lea∣ned on his breast. Every word is here a beame, and every beame is reflected, and every reflection is an intention of the heat of Christs affection to Saint John. Divis.1 A Disciple; there is the beame: 2 Ille, the, or that Disciple; there is the reflection. 1 Beloved; there is the beame: 2 Beloved of Jesus; there is the reflection. 1 Leaning; there is the beame: 2 Leaning on his breast; there is the reflection. It is a great honour to bee a Disciple, but a greater to bee the Disciple: a great honour to bee beloved, a greater to bee beloved of Jesus: a great honour to leane on such a personage, a greater to leane on his breast. Thus I might with an exact division cut the bread of life: but I choose ra∣ther after the manner of our Saviour, to breake it, and that into three pieces onely, viz. John his
1 Calling in Christ. 2 Favour with Christ. 3 Nearenesse unto Christ. 1 His calling in Christ, The Disciple. 2 His grace and favour with Christ, whom Jesus loved. 3 His nearenesse unto Christ, who also leaned on his breast. The Disciple. The Spouse in the Canticles setting out her husband in his proper colours, saith,Cant. 5.10. My beloved is white and ruddy, that is, of admirable and perfect beauty: or, white in the purity of his conversation, and ruddy in the hiew of his passion: white in his life, and ruddy at his death; or, white in his garland ofCyp. l. 1. ep. 6. Floribus enim nec rosae nec lilia de∣sunt, & pax & acies habet suos flores quibus milites Christi ob gloriam co∣ronantur. lilies, unspotted Virgins; ruddy in his garland of roses, victorious Martyrs; or lastly, as some flourish upon the letter, ruddy in all his Disciples (save St. John) who shed their blood for his name and Gos∣pell, and white in the Disciple in my text, who alone came to a faire and peaceable end; abiding (according to the words of our Saviour) till hee came unto him by an easie and naturall death. For this priviledge Christ gave him above them all, that none should have power to lay violent hands on him, who lay in his Redeemers arms.Joh. 1.17. The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth by Jesus Christ: and with grace came in John, a name that signifieth grace. Wee read of no John in the old Testament, but wee finde two in the Gospell; the one the forerunner, the other the follower of Christ; the one, in allusion to the Hebrew Etymology of his name, may bee called Gratia praeveniens, grace prevenient; the other Gratia subsequens, grace subse∣quent; the one may bee compared to  the Morning, the other to , the Evening starre: for Saint John Baptist, as the Mor∣ning starre, ushered in the Sunne our Saviour; Saint John the Evangelist, as the Evening starre, appeared long in the skie, shining in the Churches of Asia, after the Sunne of righteousnesse Christ Jesus was set, at his death. This latter John is the Disciple whose feast wee now keepe, and memory wee celebrate, and graces wee admire, and title wee are now to declare. As Christ spake of the Baptist,Mat. 11.9. What went yee out to see? a Prophet? nay I say unto you, and more than a Prophet; wee may say of this Evangelist: what are yee come to heare of? a Disciple? nay I say unto you and more than a Disciple; a Prophet, an Evangelist, an Apostle:Cic. in Brut. O generosam stirpein, & tan∣quam in unam arborem plura germina, sic in istam domum multorum in∣sitam et illumi∣natam virtu∣tem. O noble stocke, on which many grafts of the plants of Paradise are set! In some parts of the skie wee see single starres, in others a conjunction or crowne of many starres: the o∣ther Disciples were like single starres, some were Prophets, some were E∣vangelists, some Doctors, some Apostles; but in Saint John, as a constella∣tion, shine the eminent gifts and callings of many Disciples. Saint Luke was an Evangelist, but no Apostle; Saint Peter was an Apostle, but no E∣vangelist; Saint Matthew was an Evangelist and Apostle, but no Prophet; Saint John was all: 1 In his Gospell an Evangelist. 2 In his Epistle an Apostle. 5 In his Apocalypse a Prophet. And in all, according to his divine Hieroglyphicke,Rev. 4.7. The fourth beast was like a flying Eagle. An Eagle. Hee was
an Eagle in his Apostolike function;Mat. 24.28. & Luk. 17.37. where the body was, there was this Ea∣gle still lying at his breast. In his Gospell like an Eagle hee soareth higher than the other three, beginning with, and more expresly delivering the di∣vinity of Christ than any before him. Lastly, in the Apocalypse like an Ea∣gle with open eye hee looketh full upon the Sunne of righteousnesse, and the light of the celestiall Jerusalem, whereat all our eyes at this day are dazeled. Yet this divine Eagle here flyeth low, and in humility toucheth the ground, stiling himselfe nothing but a Disciple. Wee read inExod. 15.27. Exodus, They came to Elim, where are twelve Wels of wa∣ter, and seventy Palme trees. In these twelve Springs of water SaintHieron tract. de 42. mansio∣nibus. Nec du∣bium quin de Apostolis ser∣mo sit, de quo∣rum fontibus derivatae aquae, totius mundi siccitatem ri∣gant. Juxta has aquas 70. creve¦runt palmae, quas & ipsos secundi ordinis intelligimus praeceptores, Lucà Evange∣listà docente duodecim fuis∣se Apostolos, & 70. Discipulos minoris gra∣dus. Vid supr. Ser. 10. The Apo∣stolike Bishop. Jerome conceived that hee saw the face of the twelve Apostles, and on the branches of these seventy Palme trees, the fruit of the seventy Disciples labour. In allusion whereunto, most of the Ancients make the Apostles the Parents and patterns of all Bishops, and the seventy Disciples of Priests: the Bishops they make as it were the springs, from whence the Presbyters, like the Palme trees, receive sap and moisture, whereby they grow in the Church, and bring forth fruit in the parochiall Cures where they are planted. The Bishops they called Pastours and Teachers primi ordinis, of the first order or ranke: the Presbyters or Priests Praeceptores secundi ordinis, teachers as it were in a lower fourm. To confound which rankes in the Church, and bring a Bishop perforce , downe to the lower fourm or degree of a Priest, is defined sacriledge in the great Councell of Chalcedon. Yet Saint John the Apostle here of himselfe descendeth into that lower step or staire, assuming to himselfe the name onely of a Disciple, 1 In humility: 2 In modesty: 3 In thankfulnesse to his Master. 1 In humility to take all Christians into his ranke, hëe giveth himselfe no higher title than was due to the meanest follower of Christ. The weigh∣tier the piece of gold is, the more it presseth downe the scale; even so where there is more worth, you shall ever find more lowlinesse: the empty and light eares pricke up, but the full bow to the earth. 2 In modesty Saint John was the youngest of the Apostles, and in that respect tearmeth himselfe rather a Disciple, that is, a learner, than as hee was indeed, a great Master in the Church: though hee were , yet hee was not , young hee was in yeeres but not in conditions, his youth was wiser than others age, his dawning was brighter than their noon∣tide, his blossomes fairer than their fruits, his Spring exceeded their Au∣tumne; yet like Moses, hee saw not the beames of his face which all other be∣held. Young men doe not so much usually over-value themselves, as here Saint John doth under-value himselfe: the stile wherewith the Church hath most deservedly graced him, is , John the Divine, but the title which hee taketh to himselfe is but , the Scholar or Disciple. 3 In thankfulnesse to his Master he chuseth this title before any other, thereby professing that whatsoever knowledge hee had, hee suckt it from
him on whose brest he lay. About the time of our Saviours birth, asDe vit. Pont. tit. Christ. nar∣rat. Orosius. l. 6. c. 21.

Pla∣tina writeth, Augustus by a Proclamation forbad that any should call him Lord: whereby, though he intended no such thing, yet God, who secret∣ly moved him to it, may seeme to give all men to understand, that no Lord ought to be named the same day with his sonne: that when he came into the world all other Lords and Kings were as much obscured as the starres are at the rising of the Sunne.

If we teach not that which we have learned of Christ, or teach any thing as needfull to salvation, which we have not learned of Christ, we haz∣zard, if not lose, the name of Christians; for Disciples of Christ & Christians are all one; no Disciple of Christ no Christian, & every one so far a Christi∣an as a Disciple of Christ. What Christians then are Papists, whose Creed consisting of foure and twenty articles, twelve of them they learned of Christ, the other twelve of Antichrist, as may be seene in the Bull of PopeBu la S.D.N.D. Pii Papae quarti super formâ juramenti professoris affix. ad Conc. Trid. p. 439. Pius affixed to the Councel of Trent? Shall we simply affirm that they are Christians? we wrong then our selves and all the reformed Churches who have severed from them. Shall we absolutely deny that they are Christi∣ans? we wrong them who hold with us the profession of the Trinity, the two Sacraments, Baptisme and the Lords Supper, and the three Creeds,
the Apostles, the Nicene or Constantinopolitane, and that of Athanasious. Although the Roman Cardinall might justly be blamed, who caused his Painter to draw King Solomon halfe in heaven and halfe in hell: yet I sup∣pose they could not justly be censured, who should draw Popery or the Church of Rome, as she is at this day, partly in heaven, and partly in hell; in heaven in respect of those heavenly truthes which she maintaineth with us against Atheists, Jewes, Turkes, and all sorts of Infidels, and many ancient Heretiques; but in hell in respect of many pernicious and hellish errours, which she pertinaciously defendeth against the cleere letter of Scripture, and doctrine and practice of the Primitive Church. The blessed Apostle resolveth a like question concerning the Jewes, who received the Old Testament, but rejected the New in a like man∣ner:Rom. 11.28. As concerning the Gospell they are enemies for your sake: but as touch∣ing the election they are beloved for the Fathers sake. Wee can hardly come off this controversie upon better tearmes than these, that Papists, as concer∣ning the principles of the common faith, are Christians; but as touching their proper errours by addition to it, detraction from it, corruption of it, they are no Christians. You wil say this is no simple or direct answer: neither need it so to be, because the question is not simple. As it is superfluous to give a mixt or double answer to a simple question, so it is dangerous to give a simple and single answer to a mixt question, or a question of a mixt sub∣ject. 1 For instance, let the question be concerning Ayat the Jew, who used indifferently either of his hands as we use our right hand; Whether was he a right handed or a left handed man? 2 Or concerning a part of speech, which taketh part of a noune, and part of a verbe: Whether is it a noune or a verbe? 3 Or concerning a Myrmaid, which in the upper part resembleth a maid, in the lower a fish: Whether is it a fish or a maid? 4 Or concerning the Muscovy Monster, which feedeth like a sheepe, yet groweth like a plant, and hath his root affixed to the earth: Whether is it a beast or a plant? 5 Or concerning an Androgyne, that hath in it both sexes: Whether is it a man or a woman? 6 Or concerning the apple men∣tioned by Seneca, that hath in it a middle kinde of taste, bitterish at first, and sweetish at last: Whether is it a sweet or a bitter fruit? To the first we must not answer simply, that he was a right handed or left handed man, but as the Historian termeth him, an Ambodexter. To the second we must not answer simply, that it is a noune, or a verbe, but as the Grammarians call it, , participium, a participle. To the third we must not answer simply, that it is a maid, or a fish, but with the Poet a Syren; in some respect a maid, in some a fish. Prima hominis facies, & pulchro corpore virgo Pube tenus, postremâ immani corpore pistrix. To the fourth we must not answer simply, that it is a plant, or a beast, but with the Geographer, a Plantanimall. To the fift we must not answer simply, that it is a man, or a woman, but with the naturall Philosopher, an Hermaphrodite. To the sixt we must not answer simply, that it is a sweeting, or a bitter
apple, but with Seneca, that it is pomum suave-amarum, a bitter-sweet. So if the question be of a Christian by profession of all or the most fundamentall points, who yet holdeth some hereticall opinion, wee must not answer simply, that he is a Christian, or a Miscreant, but a Miscre∣ant or mis-beleeving Christian. Some write of the River Jordane, that the water thereof is sweet, and that store of fish breed and live in it: o∣thers, that it is brackish, yea and venemous also, in such sort that no fish can live in it; and both write most truly in a reference to divers parts there∣of. For all that is behether the lake Asphaltites is most sweet and whole∣some; all that is beyond it is salt and brackish, and in some places poyso∣nous: and accordingly the fish that swim not beyond the lake, or tasting the water salt, return speedily back to the sweet springs, live: but if they are car∣ried farther with a full streame into Mare mortuum, or the dead sea, they instantly perish. What then? shall wee deny Jordan, in which Christ him∣self was baptized, to be a sweet river? or do we doubt but that the doctrine of the Church of Rome, like the river Jordan, is sweet in the spring, I mean the Font of baptisme, in which so many thousands of our fathers were chri∣stened? or that good Christians may live the life of grace there, so long as they keepe within the bounds of the common Principles of Christiani∣ty; or if they have tasted some of the brackish waters, the errours of pope∣ry, if yet they returne back to the springs of holy Scripture, may they not recover? questionlesse they may: but if they passe over the lake Asphalti∣tes, and swimme with the full current into the midst of the Mare mortuum of Antichristian errours, superstitions, and Idolatries, and are not taken up in the net of the Gospell, before the venemous water hath sunke into their heart and bowels, and corrupted all their blood, wee can have little, if any hope of their safety. Those that are such, and have a resolution to continue such, I leave In mari mortuo, in the sea of death, and come to the Disciple in the bosome of Jesus the Fountaine of life, even that Disciple Whom Jesus loved. Did Jesus love him onely? did hee not love all his Apostles, save Judas, to the end? nay, doth hee not love us all with an endlesse love?Joh. 10.11. Surely greater love than this can no man shew, to lay downe his life for his friend. Is not hee the good Shepheard that gave his life for the sheepe? did he not lay down his life for us all? did one of us cost him more than another? shed he not as much and as pure life blood for one as for another? doth the Sunne of righteousnesse shine brighter up∣on one than another? in perfection of love can there be any remission or in∣tention? in that which is infinite are there any degrees? can any thing be said to bee more or lesse infinite? The determination of this point dependeth upon the consideration of our blessed Saviour: 1 As God. 2 As Man. 3 As Mediatour. As God his love is his nature, and his nature is himselfe,Solut. and himselfe is infinite, and in that which is infinite no degrees can bee distinguished. As Mediatour hee seemeth to bee like the Center, from which all lines drawne to the circumference are equall; hee casteth the like beames of affection, if
not upon all, yet certainly upon all his Elect; for whom hee prayed joint∣ly, and satisfied entirely, whom hee washeth equally in the same Font of Baptisme, feedeth equally with his blood, incorporateth equally in his bo∣dy, and maketh equally coheires with him of his kingdome in heaven. Not∣withstanding as man hee might, and did affect one more than another, and in particular hee loved John more than the rest of his Disciples. Neither is it any disparagement at all to our discretion or charity, to enlarge our hearts more to one than another, if the cause bee not a by or carnall respect, but a different measure of gifts; if those bee more in our grace, in whom Gods graces shine brighter. Saint Paul had his Barnabas, Saint Austine his Aly∣pius, Saint Jerome his Heliodorus, Saint Bernard his Gervafius, Saint Basil his Nazianzene, Eusebius his Pamphilus, David his Jonathan, and Jesus here in my text his beloved Disciple. But here Saint Austine putteth in a cu∣rious Quere; Why did Jesus love John best, sith it should seeme Peter lo∣ved Jesus best? else why doth Christ say unto him,Tract. 124. in Joh. lovest thou mee more than these? Hee who more loved Jesus is the better, but he whom Jesus more lo∣veth is the happier. To avoid this seeming jarre in Christs affections, S. Austin streineth up the plaine history to a mystery: Saint Peter, saith hee, was a type of the Church militant, Saint John of the triumphant: now the Church militant expresseth more love to Christ, in fighting his battailes, and suffering for him; but Christ manifesteth more love to the Church triumphant, crowning her with celestiall glory: in this life, like Peter, we more shew our love to Christ; in the other Christ sheweth more love to us, as he did here to Saint John. These conceptions of that seraphicall Doctour, like a waxe light newly blowne out, yeeld a sweet savour, and have much heat in them of pious affection, but little light of knowledge. For as Christs love to us is consummate in heaven at the Lambes marriage, so is then our love most complete in him. And for the two Disciples, Saint Peter and Saint John, betweene whom there was never any contention greater than this, Whether should more love our Saviour; wee may safely resolve, that though both exceedingly loved him, yet (if wee must needs enter into a comparison betweene them) that the oddes is on Saint Johns side. For doubtlesse hee whom Christ more loved, hee found or made him more thankefull: the ground of our Saviours love could be no other than grace, and he who hath a greater mea∣sure of grace, must needs more love the Fountaine of grace, Christ Jesus. As Jesus therefore more loved John, so John more loved Jesus; hee fol∣lowed him boldly to the high Priests hall, hee never denyed him once, as Peter did thrice; hee with his mother attended him at the crosse, and from that day tooke the blessed Virgin to his owne home; and therefore though Christ promised the keyes of heaven to Peter first, yet hee gave Saint John a greater priviledge, to leane on his breast. Which leaned on his breast. Of Saint Johns leaning on Christs breast foure kindes of reasons are given: 1 A civill by Calvin. 2 A Morall by Theophylact. 3 A mysticall by Saint Austine. 4 A tropologicall by Guilliandus.
Though, saithCalv. in Har∣mon. Calvin, for a servant to lye on his masters breast may seeme un∣seemly, yet the custome of the Jewes being not to fit at table, as we do, but at their meales to lye on beds or carpets on the ground; it was no more for Saint John to lye on Christs breast, than with us to sit next to him: unlesse with The∣ophylact we conceive, that Saint John upon the mention of our Lords death, and that by treason, tooke on most grievously, and beginning to languish through griefe, was taken by Christ into his bosome to comfort him: or wee interpret with Saint Austin, and others of the Ancients, Sinum Chri∣sti, Sapientiae secretum; the bosome of Christ, the cabinet of celestiall jew∣els, or treasury of wisedome; and inferre with Saint Ambrose from thence,In psal. 118. Johannes cum caput suum su∣per pectus do∣mini reclina∣ret, hauriebat profunda secre∣ta sapientiae. That John when hee laid his head to Christs breasts, sucked from thence the profound secrets of wisedome: and withBeda in E∣vang. Johan. Quia in pecto∣re Christi sunt omnes thesauri sapientiae & scientiae recon∣diti, meritò su∣per pectus ejus recumbit quem majore caeteris sapientiae & scientiae singu∣laris munere donat. Beda, That Christ revealed to Saint John as his bosome friend, more secrets; and that the reason why his wri∣tings are more enriched with knowledge, especially of things future than the rest, is, because he had free accesse to Christs breast, wherein all the treasures of wisdome and knowledge were hid. Moreover, asGuil. com. in Johan. c. 21. Guilliandus observeth, S. John lay upon Christs breast for the same reason that Moses appointed in the law the breast of all sacrifices for the Priest: to teach us, that wisedome and understanding, whose seat is the breast and heart, ought to be the speciall portion of the Priests. Among so many ingenuous reasons of this gesture of Saint John, if wee leane to Saint Austines opinion, the use wee are to make of it is, with re∣verence and religious preparation to read and heare all the bookes of holy Scripture, and especially Saint Johns writings, who received those hidden and heavenly mysteries in Jesus his bosome, which JesusJoh. 1.18. No man hath seene God at a∣ny time: the onely begotten Sonne which is in the bosome of the Father hath revealed him. heard in his Fa∣thers bosome. All Scriptures are given by2 Tim. 3.16. divine inspiration, and are e∣qually pillars of our faith, anchors of our hope, deeds and evidences of our salvation; yet as the heaven is more starry in one part than another, and the seas deeper in one place than another, so it is evident that some passages of Scripture are more lightsome than others, and some books contain in them more profound mysteries and hidden secrets; and most of all S. Johns Gos∣spell, and his Apocalypse, wherein, by Saint Jeromes reckoning, the num∣ber of the mysteries neare answereth the number of the words, quot verba tot sacramenta. If wee like of Theophylact his reason, wee are from thence to learne, not to adde affliction to the afflicted, not to vexe them that are wounded at the heart; but to stay with flaggons, and comfort with apples those that are in a spirituall swoune, and by no meanes to withhold from them that faint under the burden of their sinnes, the comforts of the Gospell to support them; especially considering, that hee as well killeth a man who ministreth not to him in due time those things which may hold life in him, as hee that slayeth him downe right. Lastly, if wee sticke with Calvin to the letter, it will discover unto us the errour of many among us, that contend so much for sitting at the Commu∣nion, and a table gesture (as they speake); whereas Christ at his last Supper neither sate nor used any table at all. In eating of the Passeover wee readMat. 26.20. . Mark. 14.18. . Luk. 22.14. . , that Christ with the twelve fell down, or lay downe after the Jewish manner, which was nearer to kneeling than sitting. But what ge∣sture
precisely hee used in the delivery of the holy mysteries, it is not ex∣pressed in Scripture: most probable it is that he kneeled, or at least that the Apostles kneeled when they received the sanctified Elements from him. For no doubt they who in the first ages immediatly succeeded the Apostles, received the Communion as the Apostles maner was; and that they kneeled, the heathen cavill against them, that they worshipped bread and wine, maketh it in a maner evident. For had they sate or stood in the celebration of the Sa∣crament, the Gentiles could have had no colour to cast an aspersion of bread-worship on them: but because in receiving the sacred elements of bread and wine, they kneeled downe, and religiously called upon God, the Pay∣nims conceived that they adored the creatures of bread and wine. And they among us who cannot distinguish betweene kneeling at the Sacrament, and kneeling to the element; bread worship and the worship of Christ, in re∣ligiously and reverently participating the holy mysteries of his body and blood, are as grossely ignorant in Christian rites as the ancient heathen were. Verely did they consider seriously who it is that under the forme of bread and wine offereth unto them his body and blood, even Christ him∣selfe by his Spirit, and what they at the same time in a thankfull love offer to God, their bodies for a holy and living sacrifice, and what then they re∣ceive, a generall pardon of all their sinnes under the seale of the King of heaven; I perswade my selfe their hearts would smite them, if they stri∣ved not to receive so great a benefit from so gracious a Majesty, as in the most thankfull, so in the most humble manner. But it is not the position of your bodies, but the disposition of your mindes, which in this rare patterne of my text I would commend to your Christian imitation. The best keeping the Feast of a Saint, is to raise him as it were to life, by expressing his vertues and graces in ours: doe you desire my brethren to be Johns, gracious in the eyes of your Redeemer? make much of those things for which hee was so much made of; love those vertues above o∣thers, which made him beloved above others; decke your soules with those jewels, the beauty whereof enamoured the Sonne of righteousnesse; which are three especially: 1 The Emerauld, the embleme of chastity. 2 The Ruby, the embleme of modesty. 3 The Carbuncle, the embleme of love. Chastity is resembled by the Emerauld, which, asRueus lib. de geminis, cap. de smaragd. Rueus writeth, hath a singular vertue to coole the heat of lust; and in this stone was the name of Levi engraven, who revenged the wrong done to the chastity of his si∣ster by theVid. infr. Shechemites. Modesty is resembled by the Ruby, in whose colour the hue of that vertue appeareth. And who cannot see in the glowing fire of the Carbun∣cle, the ardencie of love? Saint Jerome attributeth the overflowing measure of Christs love to Saint John, to his chastity; Saint Chrysostome to his mo∣desty, Aquinas to his love of Christ. Saint John lived and dyed a Virgin, and if wee will beleeve the Ancients, the cleerenesse of his complexion answered the purity of his conversation,
and beauty of body and minde met here in one. The beauty of the body is faire and brittle, like chrystall glasse; but if the gift of spirituall chastity bee incident to it, like the beames of the sunne it: is most lovely in the eyes of God and man. Eriphile was so taken with the sparkling of an orient jewell exhibited to her, that for it she sold her loyalty to her husband, a farre more pretious jewell. Take heed, Beloved, lest for favour of great ones, or worldly honour, or earthly treasure, you put away that jewell, which if you once part withall you can never recover againe. There can bee nothing more hatefull to him that was borne of a pure Virgin, continued a Virgin all his life, and now in heaven is attended by Virgins (Apoc. 14.4. These are they which were not defiled with women, for they are Virgins; these are they which follow the Lambe whithersoever he goeth:) than to make his members the members of an harlot. Wee have had the glympse of the Emerauld; let us now view the Ru∣by, Saint Johns modesty; who, though hee might glory truely, if any, in the spirit, For he had seene with his eyes, and heard with his eares, and hand∣led with his hands the Word of life: hee was an eye-witnesse of Christs trans∣figuration, one of the threeGal. 2.9. pillars mentioned by Saint Paul; he was a Prophet, an Evangelist, and an Apostle, and in greater grace with his Lord and Master than any of the rest, yet hee will bee knowne of no more than that hee was a Disciple, hee concealeth his very name. The modest opini∣on of our knowledge is better than knowledge, and humility in excellency excelleth excellency it selfe. That stone is most resplendent which is set off with a darke foyle; modesty is the darke foyle which giveth lustre to all vertues. How many, saith Seneca had attained to wisedome if they had not thought so, and therefore given over all search after it? how many had proved men of rare and singular parts, if they had not knowne them too soone themselves? Moses face shined, but he knew not of it; the blessed of the Father at the day of judgement shall heare of their good workes, but they shall not acknowledge them, but answere saying,Mat. 25.38.39. Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or a thirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sicke, or in prison, and mi∣nistred unto thee? If wee take no knowledge of our good parts, God will acknowledge them; but if like Narcissus wee know and admire our owne beauty, this very knowledge will metamorphize us, and make us seeme de∣formed in the eyes of God and man. Wee have viewed the Ruby, let us now cast a glaunce on the Carbun∣cle, the third precious stone, Saint Johns love to Christ. The maine scope of his Gospel is Christs love to us, and the argument of his Epistles our love one to another. As he is stiled the beloved, so he might well be called the loving Disciple: as hee was one of the first that came to Christ, so hee was the last that left him; hee was never from his side, I had almost sayd out of his bosome. Out of confidence of his loyall affection to his Lord, when neither Peter nor any of the rest durst, hee was bold to enquire of our Savi∣our,Joh. 13 25. who is it that shall betray thee? Hee followeth Christ to the high Priests hall, to the judgement seat, and to the crosse, where our Lord com∣mended hisJoh. 19.26. Woman behold thy sonne. Ver. 27 Then sayd hee to the Disciple, behold thy Mother. Mother to him, and him to his Mother, and his soule to his Fa∣ther. Love is the load-stone of love, that love that drew Saint Johns heart to Christ drew Christs to him. If thou desire above all things that Christ
should love thee, love him above all things: love him with all thy heart, whose heart was pierced for thee: love him with all thy soule, whose soule was made an offering for thee: love him with all thy strength, who for thee lost not onely his strength but life also. Yea, but you may say, how can wee now shew our love to Christ? he is in heaven, and our bounty cannot reach so high; wee have him not here to offer gold, myrrhe, or frankincense, as the wise men did; or minister to him of our substance, as some religious women did; or breake a boxe of pre∣cious oyntment, and poure it on his head, as Mary did; or feast him, as Si∣mon did; or wrap his corps in fine linnen, as Joseph did; wee have not his mother with us, to keepe, cherish, or comfort her, as Saint John did: yet wee have his Spouse, his Word, his Sacraments, his Disciples, his mysti∣call members; and if out of sincere love to him wee honour his Spouse the Church; wee frequent his house, the Temple; wee delight in his Word, the Scriptures; wee come reverently and devoutly to his board, the Com∣munion Table; wee give countenance and maintenance to his Meniall ser∣vants, the Ministers of the Gospell; and relieve his afflicted members, the poore and oppressed among us, wee shall bee as Johns to him, gracious in his eyes; Disciples, nay, which is more, beloved Disciples; yea so beloved, that to our endlesse rest and comfort, wee shall lye in his bosome, not on earth, but in heaven. Which hee grant unto us, whoApoc. 1.5.6. loved us, and washed our sinnes in his blood, and made us Kings to command, and Priests to offer our dearest affections unto him. To whom, &c.
THE ACCEPTED TIME: OR THE YEERE OF GRACE. THE XXXI. SERMON. 2 COR. 6.2. Behold, now is the accepted time: Behold, now is the day of salvation. AS at the Salutation of the blessed Virgin the babeLuke 1.41. sprang in the wombe of Elizabeth, so I doubt not but that at the reading of this text in your eares, the fruits of your de∣votion, which are your religious thoughts and zealous affections, leap and spring for joy in the wombe of your soule; for now is the accepted time, the time of grace: now is the day of salvation, the day of our Lords Incarnation. As the golden tongued Father spake of a Martyr, Martyrem dixisse lau∣dâsse est, to name a man a Martyr is to commend him sufficiently: so it may be said of this text, to rehearse it is to apply it. I need not fit it to the time, for the time falleth upon this time, and the day upon this day: now if ever is this Now in season. If any time in all the yeere be more acceptable than other, it is the holy time we now celebrate: now is the accepted time on Gods part, by accepting us to favour: now is the day of salvation, by exhibiting to us a Saviour in our flesh: let us make it so on our parts also by accepting the grace offered unto us, and by laying hands on our Saviour by faith, and embracing him by love, and by joy dilating our hearts to entertain him, with all his glorious attendants, a troupe of heavenly Souldiers, singing,Luke 2.14. Glory be to God on high, on earth peace, and good will towards men.Esay 49.13. Sing, O hea∣vens, and be joyfull, O earth, and breake forth into shouting, O ye mountaines:
for God hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon the afflicted. Keepe this holy day above others, because chosen by God to manifest him∣selfe in the flesh, bid by an Angell, and by him furnished both with a lesson and with an Anthem also. Well might the Angell, as on this day, sing glory in excelsis Deo, &c. for on this day the Son of God, out of his good will towards men, became man, and thereby set peace on earth, and brought infinite glory to God in the highest heavens. Well may this be called by the Apostle,Gal. 4.4. The fulnesse of time, or a time of fulnesse, which filled hea∣ven with glory, the earth with blessings of peace, and men with graces flow∣ing from Gods good will. The heavens which till this time were as clasped boxes, now not able longer to containe in them the soveraigne balsamum of wounded mankind, burst open: and he whose name isCant. 1.3. an ointment pou∣red forth, was plentifully shed upon the earth, to revive the decayed spirits, and heale the festered sores of wounded mankind. Lift up then your hea∣vie lookes, and heavier hearts, yee that are in the midst of danger, and in the sight, nay within the claspes of eternall death; you have a Saviour borne to rescue you. Cheare up your drouping and fainting spirits, all ye that feele the smart and anguish of a bruised conscience and broken heart; to you Christ is borne to annoint your wounds, bruises and sores. Exult and tri∣umph ye gally slaves of Satan, and captives of Hell, fast bound with the chaine of your sinnes; to you a Redeemer is borne to ransome you from spirituall thraldome. Two reasons are assigned why festivities are religiously to be kept. 1. The speciall benefits of God conferred upon his Church at such times, which by the anniversary celebration of the dayes are refreshed in our memories, and visibly declared to all succeeding ages. 2 The expresse command of God, which adjoyned to the former rea∣son, maketh the exercises of devotion, performed at these solemnities, duties of obedience. It cannot be denied that in this latter consideration those feasts which are set downe in the booke of God, have some prerogative above those that are found wrtiten onely in the Calendar of the Church. But in the former re∣spect no day may challenge a precedencie of this, no not the Sabbath it selfe, which the more to honour him whose birth we now celebrate, re∣signed both his name, place and rites to theAthanas. hom. de semenie. . Lords day: and if we im∣partially compare them, the worke wrought on this day was farre more difficult, and the benefit received upon it, greater than that, to the memory whereof the Sabbath was at the first dedicated. It was a greater miracle that God should be made a creature, than that he should make all creatures: and the redemption of the world so farre exceeds the creation, as the means by which it was wrought were more difficult, and the time larger: the one was finished in sixe dayes by the commandement of God, the other not in lesse than foure and thirty yeeres by the obedience of Christ: the one was but a word with God, the breath of his mouth gave life to all crea∣tures; the other cost him much labour, sweat and bloud: and what compa∣rison is there betweene an earthly and an heavenly Paradise? Nay, if wee will judge by the event, the benefit of our creation had beene none without our redemption. For by it we received an immortall spirit, with excellent
faculties, as it were sharpe and strong weapons, wherewith wee mortally wounded our selves, and had everlastingly laid weltring in our own blood, had not our Saviour healed our wounds by his wounds and death, and rai∣sed us up againe by the power of his resurrection. To which point Saint Austine speaking feelingly saith, Si natus non fuisset, bonum fuisset si homo natus non fuisset, If hee had not beene borne, it had beene good for man never to have beene borne: if this accepted time had not come, all men had beene rejected: if this day of salvation had not appeared, wee had all perished in the night of eternall perdition. Behold now is the accepted time. In this Scripture as in a Dyall wee may observe, 1 The Index, 2 The Circles, Certaine, Behold. Different: 1 The larger, 2 The narrower, The accepted time. The day of salvation. To man in generall it is an accepted time, to every beleever in particular it is a day of salvation. Lynx cum cessat intueri, cessat recordari: Because we are like the Lynx, which mindeth nothing no longer than her eye is upon it, the Spirit every where calleth upon us to looke or behold: Behold, not al∣wayes or at any time, but now, not , but , not , but ; not , but : not time simply, but season, the flower of time; not barely accepted, but according to the originall, well accepted, or most acceptable; not the day of helpe or grace, but a day of salvation. As in the bodies which consist of similar parts, the forme of the whole, and the forme of every part is all one; for example, the whole ocean is but water, and yet every drop thereof is water; the whole land is but earth, and yet every clod thereof is earth; the whole stone is but a diamond, and yet every carrect thereof in it is diamond; the whole wedge is but gold, and yet every plate, every smallest foyle or raye is gold; and as the soule of man is tota in toto, & tota in qualibet parte corporis, is whole in the whole, and whole in every part of the body; so there is season in the whole text, and in every part thereof: for there is season, and that instant in now; there is season, and that welcome in accepted time; lastly, there is season, and that most wel∣come in the day of salvation. In theEsay 49 8. accepted time I will heare thee, in the day of salvation I will helpe thee. This (I will heare thee) is as it were the noyse of heavenly musicke afarre off: Behold the accepted time, this soun∣deth like musick at our gate; but now is the day of salvation, this is like mu∣sicke at our eares. Behold the accepted time, the day starre beginneth to appeare: Behold the day of salvation, the sunne is risen: Behold now is that time, now is that day, the sunne is directly over our heads, it is now high noone. Behold is as a larum bell of attention, now is as a finger of indication or application to a season: 1 Indefinite, a time of acceptation. 2 Definite, or singular, a day of salvation:
That for information, this for our consolation. Behold is as a star or hand in the margent pointing to some excellent mat∣ter. In the Scripture wee finde foure sorts of Ecce's: 1 An Ecce of demonstration, asJoh. 19.5. Behold the man. 2 An Ecce of admiration, asMat. 2.9. Behold the starre. 3 An Ecce of affection, asJoh. 1.47. Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guilt. 4 An Ecce of excitation or attention, as1 Cor. 15.51.52. Behold I shew you a mystery: we shall not all sleepe, but wee shall all bee changed in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, at the last trumpe. The Rabbins write of Davids harp that it soun∣ded of it selfe, by the winde onely blowing on it, without the touch of any string: it were to be wished that our heart strings were like his harp strings, and would give a sweet sound by the winde onely of the Spirit blowing on them, without any touch of an Ecce of excitation or increpation: but so it is, that though our soule be full of divine graces, like Argo's eyes, yet Mer∣cury with his enchanted rod, the world with fascinating pleasures, or the Syren of our flesh with her effeminate songs closeth them all; and wee need an Ecce, like theAct. 12.7. Angels stroke on Peters side, to awake us out of our dead sleepe. A strange thing it is that our eyes should bee open, and wee runne with all speed sometimes before day out of doores, to see a May-game, or a Masque, or a Pageant, or a Morrice-dance, and yet wee should need to have an Ecce to stirre us up, and plucke open, as it were, our eye-lids to be∣hold the light of heaven, and the glory of the celestiall Paradise. Wee li∣sten willingly to wanton musick, and lascivious songs, but must be pulled by the eare to listen to the sacred songs of Sion. Beloved, did you fasten your at∣tention, did you thoroughly consider of, what you cannot but heare again & againe, unlesse with the deafe adder you stopped your eares, something would sticke by you; all our sermons, all our admonitions, all our repre∣hensions, all our consolations should not bee like letters written in sand, or the tracke of a ship in the sea, or of a bird in the ayre, or of a serpent upon a stone, whereof there remaines no print at all. Saint Hierome speaking of an Imperiall law restraining the luxury of the Clergy; The law, saith he, is good, but this is not good, that the manners of the Clergy were so dissolute that they needed such a coercive law: Bonum cauterium, sed vae nobis quod indige∣amus tali cauterio: so it may bee said of these Ecce's, or Beholds in Scrip∣ture, that they are good, and of singular use, but it is great pitty that wee should need them: it is a signe that our spirituall man is very drowsie, if not in a dead sleepe, that the Spirit calleth so often, and so loud upon us, some∣times 1 To awake our faith: as,Esay 7.14. Behold a Virgin shall hee with childe, and shall bring forth a sonne, and thou shalt call his name Emanuel. 2 To awake our hope: as,Apoc. 22.12. Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with mee, to give every man as his workes shall bee. 3 To awake our love: as1 Joh. 3.1. Behold what love God hath shewen unto in, that wee should bee called the sonnes of God. 4 To awake our feare: asApoc. 1.7. Behold hee commeth with the clouds, and e∣very eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him, and all kindreds of the earth shall vaile before him.
5 To awake our joy: as,Luk. 2.10.11. Behold I bring you tidings of exceeding great joy, which shall be to all people, that to you is borne this day in the City of Da∣vid a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. 6 To awake our thankfulnesse: as,Psal. 134.1. Behold, now praise the Lord all ye ser∣vants of the Lord, which by night stand in the house of the Lord. 7 To awake our compassion: as,Lam. 1.12. Behold if there were ever sorrow like unto my sorrow, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce wrath. 8 To awake our diligence and industry in eager and speedy pursuing the meanes of our salvation, as here in my text: Behold, now is the accepted Time. Other things are with more ease described than understood; but time is easily understood, not described or defined so easily: there is no rusticke so rude who understandeth not what you meane when you speake of time, yet never any Philosopher to this day hath exactly defined or de∣scribed it. Aristotle maketh an essay in his Physickes, determining time to be Numerum motus secundum prius & posterius, The number of motion or motion numbred according to the former or latter parts thereof: but he faileth in this his definition. For questionlesse time is as well the measure of rest as of motion: we sleepe as well in time as we worke in time. And as a ship in the Sea, whether the passengers lye in their cabbins or walke on the deckes, holdeth on her course; so whether we sleepe or wake, labour or be at our ease, the time of our life goeth on. When Josuah commanded the Sun to stand still in the heavens, all the motions of the celestiall bodies ceased, yet was there then time, wherein that noble Generall accomplished his victory. The Platonicks definition is truer, who say that time is eternity limited, but yet no way perfect. I grant time is as it were a portion or cantle of eternity; yet I deny that this is any good description of time, because every descrip∣tion ought to be per notius, by something that is more known; whereas eter∣nity is farre more obscure than time it selfe: all men have a common notion of the one, few or none of the other. Neither doe they give any better sa∣tisfaction who define time by duration. For albeit there is a time of dura∣tion of every thing, and a duration also of time it selfe, yet duration is not time; duration is the existence of any thing in time, not the terme or time it selfe. They define time most agreeable to the Scriptures, who affirme it to be the continuall fluxe of moments, minutes, houres, dayes, weekes, moneths, yeeres, ages, from the creation of the world to the dissolution thereof, after which theApoc. 10.6. Angel sware that time should be no more. But I need to speake no more of time at this time, because the word in my text is not , but , time, but season; or, as it is here rendered, The accepted time. The season is that in time which light is in the aire, lustre in metals, the flower in plants, creame in milke, quintessence in hearbs, the prime and best of it: , Now there being a threefold season: 1. Naturall, which Husbandmen observe in sowing, Gardeners in plan∣ting and graffing, Mariners in putting to Sea, Chirurgians in letting bloud, Physicians in purging, &c. 2. Civill, of which the Poet speaketh, Mollissima fandi tempora, which all humble suppliants observe in preferring petitions to Princes and great Personages.
3. Spirituall, which all that have a care of their salvation must observe, in seeking the Lord while he may be found. The Apostle in this place poin∣teth to this third, and his meaning is, Behold, now presse hard to get into the kingdome of heaven, for now the gate is open: now labour hard in Gods vineyard, for now is the eleventh houre: now put up your petitions to the Prince of peace, for now is the day of audience: now provide your selves of spirituall merchandize, for now is the mart: now cast your selves into the Bethesda of Christs bloud, for now the Angel trou∣bleth the water: now get a generall pardon for all your sinnes, under the broad seale of the King of heaven, for now is a day of sealing. When the King commeth (saith St.Chrys. in hunc locum. . Chrysostome) there is no time for sessions or as∣sises, but for pardon and favour. Behold, now the King is come to visit his subjects upon earth; and from his first comming to his last the day of grace continueth: Behold now is this accepted time. He calleth it an accepted time (saith St.Ib. . Chrysostome) because now God accepteth them to favour, who a thousand times incurred his displeasure. It is called in the Hebrew  that is, a time of good will and favour, as Calvin rendereth the words; who bid∣deth us marke the order: first a time of grace is promised, and after a day of salvation, to intimate unto us, that salvation floweth from the meere grace and mercy of God. We are active in sinne to our owne damnation, but meere passive to the first grace: we draw on damnation with the cart∣ropes of vanity, but God draweth us to salvation with the cords of love. The speciall point of doctrine to which this ecce or index in my text poin∣teth is, that we ought to take speciall notice of the time of grace, beginning at the birth of our Saviour, and ending to us at the day of our death, and to all men that shall be upon the earth at the consummation of the world. As the celesti∣all spheres are wrapt one in another, and the greatest, which the Philoso∣phers terme the Primum mobile, invelopeth all the rest; so the parts of time are enclosed, the lesser in the greater, houres in dayes, dayes in yeeres, yeers in ages, and ages in the time of the duration of the world. To explicate then to the full the time of our Lords birth, it will be requisite to treat 1 Of the age of the world. 2 Of the yeere of the age. 3 Of the day of the yeere in which the trueJohn. 1.9. light that lighteneth every man that commeth into the world first shined on the earth. 1 Of the age of the world. The Jewes, according to an ancient tradi∣tion received from the house of Elias, make three ages of the world, as it were so many stages of time: 1 From the creation to the law. 2 From the law to the Messias. 3 From the comming of the Messias to the end of the world. To each of these they allow two thousand yeeres, counting thus, 1Carion. in Chron. Duo millia vacuum. 2 Duo millia lex. 3 Duo millia Messias; & post mundi deflagratio.
Saint.Aug. de civit. Dei. l. 22 c 30. Post hanc tan quam in die septimo requi escet Deus, cum eundem septi∣mum diem quod nos eri∣mus in seipso faciet requies∣cere. Austine doubleth these files, and maketh reckoning of sixe ages. 1 From Adam to the Deluge. 2 From the Deluge to Abraham. 3 From Abraham to Solomon. 4 From Solomon to the captivity. 5 From the captivity to Christs birth. 6 From Christs birth to the day of judgement; after which, in the seventh, we shall all keepe an eternall Sabbath in heaven. By both which computations it appeareth that the birth of our Saviour fell late towards the declining and end of time, asMaxin. Taur. hom 6 de nativ. In fine tempo∣rum natus est ille cujus aeterni¦tatem nulla sae∣culorum tem∣pora compre∣hendunt. Maximus Taurinensis ob∣serveth. Here the wit of man, which like the Sea will still be working, though oftentimes foaming out his owne shame, curiously enquireth why the desire and joy of all mankind was so long delayed, why he was so late born whose birth was of more importance than of all the Potentates, Prin∣ces, Kings, Emperours and Monarchs of the whole world. Was not Christ the bright morning starre? how came it then to passe that he appeared not till the afternoone, if not evening of the world? Was not he the bride∣groome, whoseMarriage song. Epithalamium Solomon by the spirit of prophesie endited in the booke of Canticles? how could hee then heare his dearest Spouse breathe out so many sighes, and shed such abundance of teares, in so many ages, still longing for his comming, and crying,Cant. 1.1. Let him come into the flesh, and kisse mee with the kisses of his lips? Was not hee the good Samaritan which healed the wounded man, after Moses the Levite, and Aaron the Priest passing by left him as they found him, and did him no ease at all? how then could this tender hearted Chirurgian suffer wounded mankinde to lie so many ages weltring in his owne bloud, and take no pity on him? To silence these curious questionists, the most judicious Divines teach, that albeit God hath speciall reasons of his will for every thing he determineth, yet to us his will must stand for the last and best reason. The fullest answer that can be given to that demand, why Christ was borne in the dayes of the Roman Augustus, about the two and fourtieth yeere of his reigne, is, that then was the fulnesse of time, that is, the time was fully come, which God appointed before all time, for the comming of his Sonne in the flesh. And surely a fitter time could hardly have beene chosen, whether we respect the condition of the patient, or the quality of the Physician, or the state of Judaea, or of the whole world at that time. First, if we regard the condition of the patient: before Adam fell, and by his fall tooke his deaths wound, there was no need of a Chirurgian or a Physician: and after he was wounded it was fit that he should feele the smart of his wounds a while, and by wofull experience find that he was not able to help himselfe. With this reasonSumm. p. 3. q. 1. art. 5. Non de∣cuit à princi∣pio humani ge∣neris ante pec∣catum Deum incarnari: non enim datur me∣dicina nisi infir∣mis: nec statim post peccatum conveniens fuit Deumincarnari propter condi∣tionem primi peccati quod a superbia perve∣nerat, unde co¦modo homo e∣rat liberandus ut recognosceret se indigere libera∣tore. Aquinas rested satisfied. Secondly, if we regard the quality of the Physician. For no man sen∣deth for the greatest Doctour, especially if he be farre off, before he hath tried others that are neere at hand, or the cure grow dangerous, if not de∣sperate. Before the King commeth himselfe, many Embassadours and No∣ble men are sent. Nature and Art observe the like method, proceeding from lesse noble to more noble workes: from the egge to the chicke, from the
seed to the fruit, from the kernell to the apple, from the dawning to the day, from childhood to youth, and from youth to perfect age. The painter in like manner first maketh a rude draught of a face, after perfectly pourtray∣eth it, and last of all casteth beautifull colours upon it: the Chirurgian first washeth the wound, then poureth in wine to search it, and after oile to supple and heale it: in like manner the providence of God proceeded in the dispen∣sing the meanes of mans salvation, after the twylight of nature, and daw∣ning as it were of the day, the day starre appeared more obscurely in the publishing of the law, but manifestly in Saint John Baptists doctrine; and then the Sunne arose in the preaching of the Gospell: first God sent Priests and Prophets as messengers, then Angels and the Archangell, as it were Princes and Peeres of heaven, and last of all he sent his Sonne, the heire of all things. Like a Chirurgian he first cleansed the sores of wounded man by pouring in the wine of the Law, after he suppled and healed them by pouring in the oyle of the Gospell: first he rough hewed us by Moses, and after plained and smoothed us by Christ, that we might be as the polished corners of the Temple. Thirdly, if we regard the state of Judaea, which was now most deplo∣rate, being destitute both of King and Law-giver: for Herod a stranger u∣surped the Crowne, and destroyed the Sanedrim, or great Councell, they had now no Prophet or Seer to lead them in this time of thickest darknesse: now therefore, if ever, the Messiah must come to set all right. Fourthly, if we regard the state of the whole world, which at this time was most learned, and thereby most capable of the doctrine of the Gospell. Besides, it being reduced to a Monarchy, and the parts thereupon holding better correspondency one with the other, a greater advantage was given for the dispreading of Christian doctrine through all the Provinces of the Roman Empire. 2 Of the yeere of the age. As God crowned the age in which our Lord tooke flesh, with many remarkeable accidents; so also the yeere of that age. 1 First, Herod this very yeere bereaving the Tribe of Judah of King and Lawgiver, utterly abolished their grand Councell, and thereby the Pro∣phesie of Jacob was verified, thatGen. 49.10. the Scepter should not depart from Ju∣dah, nor a Lawgiver from betweene his feet till Shilo come. The substance of the Scepter, if I may so speake, was departed before, and this yeere the sha∣dow also remaining hitherto in the Sanedrim, which had a kind of sovereign power to make lawes and execute them, vanished away: now therefore Shilo commeth. 2 Secondly, Moreover, this very yeere Augustus CaesarLuke 2.1. sent forth a Decree, that the whole world should be taxed, which was not without a mystery, viz. that this yeere the world should be prized, and an estimate made thereof, when our Lord came into the world to redeeme it. Little thought Augustus (when he gave order for drawing that Proclamation) of drawing Marie to Bethlehem, that she might there be delivered according to the prophesie ofMicah 5.2. Micah: yet so did Augustus his temporall De∣cree make way for Gods eternall determination of Christs birth in Beth∣lehem.
3 Thirdly, this very yeere the same Emperour shut up the Temple ofFunctius in Chron. Janus, where all the Roman warlike provision lay, and established a peace through the whole world, that so the Prince of peace might be borne in the dayes of peace. 4 Fourthly, this yeere also he enacted a lawSethus Calvi∣sius ex Dione Cassio. De manumissione servo∣rum, of setting servants at liberty, which might have some reference to the spirituall freedome whichJohn 8.36. Christ purchased for us, whereof hee himselfe saith, If the Sonne make you free you shall bee free in∣deed. 5 Fiftly, this yeere in a certaine Shop or Inne to be let in Rome, aPlat ex Eu∣trop & paulo diac. fountaine of oyle sprang out of the earth, and flowed a whole day with∣out intermission. Magna taberna fuit tunc emeritoria dicta, De qua fons olei fluxerat in Tiberim. Which may seeme literally to verifie those words of the Prophet,Esay 10.27. It shall come to passe in that day, that his burden shall be taken off thy shoulder, and his yoake from off thy necke; and the yoake shall be destroyed because of the oyle or annointing. 6 Sixtly, what should I speake of the falling downe of the Tem∣ple ofMagdeburg ex Petro comest. Templum pacis corruit Romae ne alibi quam in Messiâ pax quaereretur. peace in Rome about this time? Might not that be an item, that true peace was no where now to bee sought save in Jesus Christ our one∣ly Peace-maker, now come into the world to reconcile Heaven and Earth, and establish a covenant of grace betweene God and man for ever? 7 Seventhly, neither isCalvis. in Chron. ad an. c. 1. Calvisius his hote discordant from our purpose, viz. that the yeere of our Lords birth was Annus Sab∣bathicus, a yeere made of seven multiplyed, or a yeere of Jubile. For even by this very circumstance wee may bee put in minde that he who was borne in a temporall Sabbathicke yeere on earth procureth for us an e∣verlasting Sabbath in heaven. 3 Of the day of the yeere. From the age in which our Lord was incarnate wee have already proceeded to the yeere; now from the yeere wee will come to the day on which God hath set many glorious markes. 1 First, St. Matthew telleth us of aMat. 2.2. new starre that appeared to the hea∣then Sages, which guided them in their way to Bethlehem. 2 Secondly, St.Quest. vet. & N.T. Hodeno die natus est Christus, octa∣vo Calend. Jan. ab illo die cres∣cunt dies: ecce à nativitate Christi dies crescit, illo oriente dies proficit. Austine, and St.Ambros. Serm. 8. de temp. Ambrose, andPrudent. in hyn. ad Cal. Jan. Quid est quod Arctum circulum Sol jam recurrens deserit? Christusne terris nascitur qui lucis augit ramitem? Prudemius note that the day of our Lords birth fell precisely upon the winter solstice, and from that day the dayes begin to lengthen. 3 Thirdly, this day in the vineyard ofMagdeburg. ex Martino. Vinca Engaddi quae balsamum ferebat, horem, fructum, & liquorem simul fudit. Engaddi the Balsamum tree both blossomed and bare fruit, and liquor also dropped from it. Thus we see what golden characters God hath fixed upon the age, yeere
and day of our Lords birth; in which we may read the benefits of his in∣carnation, which are these: First, rest: this seemeth to be figured by the Sabbathicke yeere. Secondly, peace: this was shadowed by the temporall peace concluded through all the world by Augustus. Thirdly, libertie from spirituall thraldome: this was represented by the law of manumission of servants. Fourthly, Knowledge: this was shewed by the new starre. Fiftly, encrease of grace: this was signified by the lengthening of the dayes from Christs birth. Sixtly, spirituall joy: this was expressed by the oyle which sprang out of the earth. Seventhly, health and life: this the Balsamum was an embleme of. This peace, this libertie, this knowledge, this grace, this joy, this health, God offereth to us in this accepted time, and day of salva∣tion. Behold, now, &c. The Jewes had their now, and that was from the day of our Lords birth to the time of the destruction of the Temple, be∣fore which a voyce was heard at midnight, saying,Joseph. de bello Jud. l 7. Migre∣mus hinc. Let us goe hence. The Gentiles now or day of grace began after PetersActs 10.11. vision, and shall continue untill the fulnesse of all Nations be come in. Our Countrie's now for their conversion from Paganisme began when Joseph of Arimathea, or Simon Zelotes, or Saint Paul, or some other of the Apostles planted the Gospell in this Island: for our reversion to the puritie of the ancient doctrine and discipline, was from the happie reformation in King Henry the eighth his time, and Kings Edward the sixts, and shall last till God for our sinnes remove our golden Candle∣sticke. All your now who heare me this day is from the day of your new birth in baptisme, till the day of your death. Application.Behold, now is your accepted time, now is your day of salvation: make good use of these golden moments, upon which dependeth your eter∣nall happinesse or miserie. Yet by a few sighes you may drive away the fearefull storme that hangeth over you; yet with a few teares you may quench the fire of hell in your consciences; yet by stretching out your armes to God, and laying hold on Christ by faith, you may be kept from falling into the brimstone lake. While yee have the light of this day of gracePhil. 2.12. Worke out your salvation with feare and trembling, before the night of death commeth, whenJohn 9.4. no man can worke. If you reject this accepted time, and let slip this day of salvation, there remaineth nothing for you but a time of rejection.Mat. 7.23. Away from mee, I know you not: and a day of damnation,Mat. 25.41. Goe yee cursed into everlasting fire. To apply this now yet once more. Behold now in these feasts of Christmas is tempus acceptum, an accepted time, or a time of acceptati∣on, a time when wee accept and entertaine one another, a time of gi∣ving and accepting testimonies of love, a time of receiving the holy
Sacrament, a time when God receiveth us into favour, biddeth us to his owne table. Behold, now is the day of salvation; the day in which our Saviour was borne, and theTitus 2.11. grace of God, bringing salvation, appeared unto all men. This day our Saviour will come into thy house; and if with humble de∣votion, godly sorrow, a lively faith, and sincere love thou entertaine him, what himselfe spake to Zacheus, the Spirit will speake unto thee;Luke 19.9. This day is salvation come to thy house. Which God the Father grant for the merits of his Sonne, through the power∣full operation of the holy Spirit. To whom, &c.
THE SPOUSE HER PRECIOUS BORDERS. A rehearsall Sermon, preached Anno 1618. THE XXXII. SERMON. CANT. 1.11. We will make thee borders of gold, with studs of silver. Right Honourable, &c. AS the riches of Gods goodnesse are set forth to the eye of the body by the diversity of creatures in the booke of nature; so are the treasures of his wisedome expo∣sed to the eye of the mind by the varietie of senses in the booke of Scripture. Which in this respect is by re∣verend antiquitie compared to the scrole inEzek. 2.10. Vid. Hier. in c. 2. Ezekielis. Ezekiels vision, spread before him, which was written Intus & à tergo, within and without: without in the letter, within in the Spirit; without in the history, within in the mystery; without in the typicall ceremonies, within in the morall duties; without in the Legall resemblance, within in the Evangelicall reference; without in verborum foliis, within in radice ratio∣nis, as St. Jerome elegantly expresseth it. The former sense resembleth the goldenExod 16.33. And Moses said to Aaron, take a pot and put an Omer full of Manna therein, &c. pot, the latter the hiddenRev. 2.17. Manna it selfe: that is as the shell or mother of pearle, this as the Margarite contained within it; both together, asNazianz ad Nemes. Litera∣lem comparat corpori, spiritu∣alem animae; & Verbum Dei geminam habet naturam, divi∣nam invisibi∣lem, humanam visibilem: ita Verbum Dei scriptum habet sensum exter∣num & inter∣num. Nazianzen observeth, make this singular correspondency betweene the incarnate and the inspired word of God, (both conceived by the holy Ghost, and brought forth in sacred sheets) that as the one consisteth of two natures, humane and divine, visible and invisible; so the other of two senses, externall and internall; externall and visible in the shadow or letter, internall
and invisible in the substance or spirituall interpretation: either tropologi∣call, or allegoricall, or anagogicall, as the learned distinguish. DothSen. ad Lucil. ep. 23. Levium metallorum fructus in sum∣mo est, illa o∣pulentissima sunt quorum in alto latet vena assiduè pleniùs respon∣sura fodienti. expe∣rience teach us that the richest metals lie deepest hid in the earth? Shall we not think it very agreeable to divine wisdome so to lay up heavenly knowledge in Scriptures, that the deeper we dig into them by diligent meditation, the veine of precious truth should prove still the richer? Surely howsoever some Divines affect an opinion of judgement (it is judgement in opinion onely) by allowing of no sense of Scripture, nor doctrine from thence, ex∣cept that which the text it selfe at the first proposing offereth to their con∣ceit; yet give me leave to tell them that they are but like Apothecaries boyes, which gather broad leaves and white flowers on the top of the wa∣ter; not like cunning Divers, who fetch precious pearles from the bottome of the deepe. St.L. 2. confes. c. 31. Sensit om∣nino ille, & cogitavit cum ea scriberet quicquid hic ve∣ri potuimus in∣venire, & quic∣quid nos non potuimus aut nondum possu∣mus, & tamen in tis inveniri potest. Austine, the most judicious of all the Fathers, is of a diffe∣rent judgement from them herein. For he confidently affirmeth, that the Pen-man of the holy Ghost of purpose so set downe the words, that they might be capable of multiplicitie of senses; and that he intended and meant all such divine truthes as we can finde in the words, and such also as we have not yet, or cannot finde, and yet by diligent search may be found in them. Now as the whole texture of Scripture, in regard of the variety of senses, may not unfitly be likened to the Kings daughtersPsal. 45.14. raiment of needle-worke, wrought about with divers colours: so especially this of the Can∣ticles, wherein the allegoricall sense, because principally intended, may be called literall; and the literall or historicall, as intended in the second place, allegoricall. Behold here, as in a faire samplar, an admirable patterne of drawne-worke, besides King Solomon in his royall robes and his Queene in a vesture of gold, divers birds expressed to the life, as the whiteCant. 5.12. ver. 11..2.2. ver. 13. c. 4.14. c. 2.1. c. 5.14. c. 1.17. c. 5.15. c. 1.10. Dove, washed with milke, and the blacke Raven: divers trees, as the thorne, the fig-tree, and the vine, the myrrhe, spikenard, saffron, calamus, cinamon, with all trees of frankincense: divers flowers, as the Rose and the Lilly: divers precious stones, as the Berill and the Saphir: lastly, divers artificiall wokes, as Houses of Cedar, Rafters of Firre, Tents of Kedar, Pillars of Marble, set in sockets of fine gold, rowes of Jewels, Chaines, and here in my text, Borders of gold, and Studs of silver. Sanctius and Delrio upon my text observe, that Solomon alludeth to theShe shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. 13. verse of the 68. Psalme; and what the Father prophesied of the Spouse, the Sonne promiseth to her, viz. to make her borders, or, as the Hebrew signifieth also,Brightman in Cant. Tur∣tures aureas, a∣lii murenulas, aliilineas, septu∣aginta similitu∣dines. turtles of gold, enameled with silver. Howbeit it seemeth more probable that these words have a reference to the 9. verse of this chap∣ter, and that Solomon continueth his former comparison of a troup of horses in Pharaoh's Charriot: and thus the borders and chains in the 10th. and 11th. verses are linked to the 9th. O my beloved and beautifull Spouse, as glori∣ous within, through the lustre of divine vertues and graces, as thou art resplendent without in jewels and precious stones: to what shall I liken thee? or whereunto shall I compare thee? Thou art like a troupe of milke white horses in Pharaoh's princely Charriot, adorned with rich trappings, and most precious capparisons. For as their head and cheekes are beset with rowes of stones, so thy cheekes are decked with jewels that hang at
thine eares: as their neckes shine with golden raines, so thy necke is com∣passed with chaines of gold and pearle: and as their breasts are adorned with golden collars, quartered into borders, enamelled with silver, so that thou must herein also resemble them, wee will make thee borders of gold, with studs of silver, to hang about thy necke, and downe thy breast. Thus much of the letter, or rather letters of my text, which you see are all golden, flourished over with strikes, or, as Junius translateth the words, points of silver: now let us endevour to spell the meaning. As artificiall pi∣ctures drawne by the pencill of a skilfull Opticke, in the same part of the frame or table, according to divers sites and aspects represent divers things: (looke one way upon them, you shall see a man, another way a lion;) so it is in this admirable piece drawne by the pencill of Solomon; according to divers aspects it presenteth to our view divers things: looke one way on it and there appeareth a man, to wit King Solomon; looke another way and there appeareth a lion, the lion of the tribe of Judah; looke downeward upon the history, and you shall see Solomon with a crowne of gold, and his Queen in her wedding garment; looke upward to the allegory, and you shall see Christ crowned with thornes, and his Spouse the Church in a mourning weed, and under the one written a joyfull Epithalamium, under the other a dolefull Elegy. Agreeable to which double picture drawne with the selfe same lines and colours, wee may consider the chaines and borders of gold in my text, either as habiliments of Solomons Queene, or ornaments of Christs Spouse. If wee consider them in the first sense, they shew his royall magnificence and pompe; if in the second, either they sig∣nifie the types and figures of the Jewish Synagogue under the law, or the large territories and rich endowments of the Christian Church under the Gospell.Faciemus ti∣bi similitudi∣nes aur cum puncturis ar∣genti. Origen, who taketh the seventy Interpreters for his guide, thus wadeth through the allegory: The Angels, saith he, or Prophets speake here to the Spouse before her husband Christ Jesus came in the flesh to kisse her with the kisses of his lips, and their speech is to this effect; O beautifull Spouse, wee cannot make thee golden ornaments, we are not so rich, thy husband when bee commeth will bestow such on thee; but in the meane time wee will make thee , similitudes of true things; similitudines au∣ri, with studs or points of silver, id est, scintillis quibusdam spiritualis intelli∣gentiae that is points, spangles, or sparkles of precious and spirituall meaning. For example: Aarons mitre and his breast-plate of judgement, engraven with Urim and Thummim, and his golden bells were similitudines auri, simi∣litudes of gold, or golden similitudes: and the studs or points of silver, that is, sparkles or rayes of spirituall truth in them were Christ his three offices; His Priestly, represented by the breast-plate. His Princely by the mitre. His Propheticall by the bells. Againe, in the breast-plate of Aaron there were set in rowes twelve precious stones; here were similitudes of gold, or golden similitudes; and the studs of silver, that is, sparkles or rayes of spirituall meaning, were the
Apoc. 21.14. twelve Apostles, laid as precious stones in the foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem, that is, the Church. Take yet a third example: in the Arke there were the twoHeb. 9.4. Tables, and the golden of Manna, and the rod that had budded; these were similitudines auri, golden similitudes: and the puncta argenti, that is, the cleere and evident points of spirituall truth in them, are the three notes of the true Church: 1 The Word, or the Old and New Testament, signified by the two Tables. 2 The Sacraments, prefigured in the golden pot of Manna. 3 Ecclesiasticall discipline, shadowed by Aarons Rod. Thus I might take off the cover of all the legall types, and shew what lieth under them, what liquor the golden vessell containeth, what myste∣ries the precious robes involve, what sacraments their figures, what ablu∣tions their washings, what table their Altars, what gifts their oblations, what host their sacrifices pointed unto. The Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrewes observeth such an admirable correspondency betweene these things, that in this respect the whole Scripture may be likened to one long similitude, the protasis whereof or first part is in the Old Testament, & the antapodosis or second part in the New. For in the Old, as the Apostle te∣stifieth, there wereHeb. 9.23.24. similitudes of true things; but in the New we finde the truth of those similitudes. Which if our new Sectaries of the precisian or ratherMr. Whit∣tall, Bradburn, and their fol∣lowers. circumcision cut had seriously thought upon, they would not, like Aesops dog, let fall the substance by catching at the shadow; they would not be so absurd as to goe about to bring the aged Spouse of Christ to her festraw againe, and reduce all of us her children to herGal. 4.2.3. nonage under the law: they would not be so mad as to keepe new moones, and Jewish Sab∣baths, after the Sunne of righteousnesse is risen so long agoe, and hath made us an everlasting Sabbath in heaven. These silly Schismatickes doe but feed upon the scraps of the old Ebionites, of whomHay. hist. sac. l. 3. Ebionitae pauperes inter∣pretantur, & verè sensu pau∣peres ceremo∣nias adhuc le∣gis custodientes Haymo out of Eusebius writeth thus; (The Ebionites, according to the Hebrew Etymologie of their name, are interpreted poore and silly; and so indeed they are in understan∣ding, who as yet keepe the ceremonies of the old Law.) Nay rather they licke the Galathians vomit, and therefore I thinke fit to minister unto them the purge prescribed by theGal. 3.1, 2, 3. Apostle: O foolish Galathians, who hath be∣witched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath beene evidently set forth, crucified among you? This onely would I learne of you, received yee the Spirit by the workes of the Law, or by the hearing of faith? Are yee so foolish? having begun in the Spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh? Behold IGal. 5, 2. Paul testifie unto you, that if you be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing: we may adde, If you keepe the Jewish Sabbath, or abstain from swines flesh, out of conscience, and in obedience to the ceremo∣niall Law, Christs flesh shall profit you nothing: if you abstaine from bloud in any such respect, Christs bloud shall profit you nothing. For I testifie againe, saith St. Paul, to every man that is circumcised, that he is become a debter to the whole Law. And will they not yet learne that Mosaicall rites and ceremonies were at severall times
1. Mortales or moriturae, 2. Mortuae, 3. Mortiferae? They were mortales at their first constitution, mortuae, that is, dead, at Christs death, and now mortiferae, deadly, to all that observe them. Will they put off the long white robes washed in the bloud of the Lambe, and shrowd themselves with the old rags, or, as St. Paul termeth them, beggar∣ly rudiments of the Law? If they are so minded, I leave them, and fill up this Border with the words of SaintSer. 7. Anti∣qua observatio novo tollitur sacramento, hostia in ho∣stiam transiit, sanguinem san∣guis excludit, & legalis festi∣vitas dum mu∣tatur, impletur. Leo, The ancient rite is taken away by a new Sacrament, one host passeth into another, bloud excludeth bloud, and the Legall festivity is fulfilled, in that it is changed. The second exposition of this Scripture, which understandeth the gol∣den borders and silver studs of the glorious and pompous splendour of the Christian Church, seemeth to come neerer unto the letter faciemus, wee will make thee; the verbe in the future tense evidently implyeth a promise or prophesie, and the sense of the whole may be illustrated by this or the like Paraphrase: O glorious Spouse of Christ, and blessed Mother of us all, who art compassed with a straight chaine about thy necke, that suffe∣reth thee not to breathe freely (being confined to the narrow limits of Judea): in the fulnesse of time the fulnesse of the Gentiles shall come in, and in stead of a straight chaine of gold, or small string of pearle, we will make thee large borders; we will environ thee with Christian auditories and congregations, as it were borders of gold, and these borders of gold shall be set out, and supported with studs of silver, that is, enriched with temporall endowments, and upheld by regall authority:Esay 49.23. King shall bee thy nursing fathers, and Queenes shall be thy nursing mothers. Nay, such shall be thy honour and power, that thou shalt binde Kings withPsal. 149.8. chaines, and Nobles with linkes of iron, who for their ransome shall offer unto thee store of gold to make thee borders, and silver for studs. Which prophesie seemed to have been fulfilled about the dayes of Con∣stantine, or a little after, when such was the sumptuous statelinesse of Chri∣stian Churches, and so rich the furniture thereof, that it dazled the eyes of the Heathen; Foelix the Emperours Treasurer blessing himselfe when hee beheld the Church vessels and vestments, saying: En qualibus vasis mini∣stratur Mariae filio! See what plate the sonne of Mary is served in! Here I might take occasion to congratulate our Churches of great Britaine, which alone among all the Reformed, have preserved from sacriledge (ransacking holy things under pretence of zeale against Idolatry) some remaines of Ec∣clesiasticall preferments and sacred ornaments, as it were borders of gold. But the time and your expectation call mee from the explication of this Scripture, to make some application thereof to this present exercise. Whereto I would presently addresse my selfe, if I were not arrested by a new action repetundarum, commenced justly against those, who before mee have repeated in this place. It is alledged against them, that they have tur∣ned recensere into censere, or censuram ferre, rehearsing into censuring, and contraction of Sermons into detraction from the Preachers. This is utterly
a fault, and I hold it most necessary at this time and in this place to reprove it, that the plaster may be applyed where the wound hath been given. It is no better than in stead of wine to offer to Christ on this Crosse the sharpest vinegar: after which if any thirst here, I thinke fit to send him packing on Martial the Poet his errand; Vaticana bibas si delectaris aceto, non facit ad stomachum nostra lagena tuum. Can a fountaine out of the same place send forth bitterJam. 3.11. waters and sweet? can a man with the same breath blesse God and scandalize his Ministers, glorifie him and disgrace their brethren? If any Rehearser hereafter shall turne Satyrist, and take delight in spilling much wit and reading in this kinde, I desire him seriously to consider, that asAusonius in epig. Autorem feriunt tela re∣torta suum. Achyllas was hurt in the eye by the rebound of that very stone, which hee inhumanely coited at a skull; so that they cannot cast any contumelious aspersion in this kind upon their brethren in the Ministery, but that it will rebound backe upon them∣selves, and wound them in the eye of their discretion, to say no more. For even they who most applaud their pregnancy, or rather luxuriancy of wit, secretly condemne their want of judgement, as Tully did his, who wonder∣fully pleased himselfe in that Paronomasie, Videte patres conscripti, ne cir∣cumscripti videamini, whereby he offended all the Senate; Ego verò non tanti fecissem , I would not have set so much by a figure or caden∣cy of sentence, as for it to fall out with the Councell of State.Lib. 6. instit. Orator. Nimi∣um risus preti∣um est, si pro∣bitatis impen∣dio constat. Quinti∣lian gravely schooles such, telling them, that e buyeth a witty conceit or jest at too deare a rate, who pawneth his honesty for it: Much more he, who paw∣neth Christian charity for it. The Ministers of the Gospel, who are stiledRev. 1.20. angels in holy Scripture, ought to resemble the Cherubims in the Arke, which cast a gracious aspect one upon the other; and Rehearsers should be like the golden snuffers of the Temple, not like extinguishers of baser me∣tall: they ought to take away the superfluity, and cleere the light of their brethrens labours, not put it out as some have done of late, and left a loath∣some savour behind them: or, to make use of the similitude which I find in my Text, they should be like studs of silver in borders of gold, receive, and give a mutuall lustre one to the other. Thus having given a law to my selfe as well as others, I proceed to speak of the worthy Speakers, whose resounding eccho the redoubled command of authority hath made mee at this present, who like the RomaneCic. divinat. in Ver. Quem∣vis ut mallem eorum qui pos∣sunt quàm me, me ut mallem quam nemi∣nem. Ora∣tor (in his divination in Verrem) had rather that any should have undertaken this taske than my selfe, my selfe rather than none. If (as the Proverbe is) tria sunt omnia, so it might be said truly, quatuor sunt omnia, I should not doubt but to fit the foure Speakers, whose re∣membrancer I must be, with a similitude running upon foure feet. But it is far otherwise, there are few quaternians in nature, and these have been laid out for, and anticipated long agoe. Besides, asNat. hist. l. 28. c. 8. Ca∣melion saluta∣ris est parturi∣entibus, si sit domi, si verò inferatur, per∣nitiosissimus. Pliny writeth of the flesh of a Camelion, that it is very wholesome for women in labour, if the Came∣lion were bred in the country, but very unwholsome if it be brought from forraine parts; so it may be truely said of allusions and applications, If they
are home borne as it were, and taken from things neere at hand, they are in request; but if they be farre fetched they lose their grace. Howsoever, they who never meane to touch this heavie burthen so much as with a little fin∣ger, should forbeare to censure those who in these later yeeres are to fur∣nish this exercise, yea, though we send farre for our provision in this kind; sith our just apology may be, that Pliny and Solinus their markets have bin fore-stalled, and there is nothing to be had neere at hand. The foure Postes have long agoe rode their foure stages. The foure parts of the World have been traversed. The foure rivers of Paradise have been drawne dry. The foure winds have breathed out their last gaspe. The foure rich Merchants have sold their commodities. The foure Embassadours have delivered their embassages. What shall I adde more? Heaven it selfe hath been ransacked, and from thence foure Angels have been called down to sound the foure last Trumps: Nay, Hell it selfe hath been raked for similitudes, and from thence Proteus was conjured up, to turne himselfe into foure shapes. This (as I conceive) occasioned my immediate predecessour, with whose praises the Crosse yet rings, to chime the Rehearsers knell with foure Bells in this place, where there was never yet any one hung. Nothing remaineth for mee, who am to fish for allusions after all these, but to make use of the words of my Text according to the seventies Translation, faciamus similitudines, to set forth a new Pliny, and forge new similitudes of things that never were nor will be. But see, as Apelles when hee had often tryed to paint thePlin. nat. hist. l. 32. Apelles cum spumam pingere vellet, & saepiùs fru∣strà expertus esset, iratus arti spongram im∣pegit in viso loco tabulae, & illa reposuit ablatos colores qualiter cura optabat, fecit∣que in picturâ fortuna natu∣ram. foming of a horse, and could never come neere it, at last in a rage flung his spunge care∣lesly upon his worke, and chance expressed that which art could not: so after much labour taken in devising an embleme, and pourtraying a lively draught of these foure Speakers, at last, unsatisfied with any, I threw downe my pensill upon my worke, and behold, quod ars non potuit, casus expressit, I finde here casually in my Text what I so long sought for, similitudines auri, golden resemblances, to wit, borders of gold with studs of silver. For, asSanctius in hunc locum. Aurum, ut ait Aquinas, signi∣ficat sensum spiritualem, argentum elo∣qum nitorem; illud suppedi tat Scriptura, hoc ars concio∣natoris. Aquinas teacheth us, the gold mystically signifieth the Spirits meaning, the studs of silver the Preachers art; gold representeth the precious do∣ctrine they delivered, silver the perspicuity of their speech, and bright lustre of their stile. As for the number, the Text saith borders, in the plurall num∣ber, and if Solomon continue his former comparison of a troupe of horses in Pharaohs charret (in the precedent Verse) which were foure, after the cu∣stome of all Nations when they rode in state, Ergo erit ille dies quo tu pulcherrime rerum quatuor in niveis aureus ibis equis. the borders by consequence must needs be foure. And herein the mysticall ornaments of the Spouse are corresponding to the typicall ornaments of her Husband. As theExod. 28.17. breast of Aaron (a type of Christ) was adorned with foure rowes of precious stones; so the necke and breast of Solomons Queen (the Churches type) is decked here with foure borders of gold. See then here as it were the modell of my intended frame. The friends
of the Spouse who present her with foure borders of gold, with studs of silver, are the foure Preachers, whose Sermons may be compared to the borders in my text in a fourefold respect: 1 Of the number; foure Borders, foure Sermons. 2 Of the order; the Borders were set immediatly one under another, the Sermons preached one after another. 3 Of the matter; the Borders were made of gold, the Sermons con∣sisted of Scripture doctrine, like untoApoc. 3.18. gold tryed in the fire. 4 Of the forme; the Borders were enameled with silver, or set out with spangles of that metall; and in the Sermons Scripture doctrine was beautified with variety of humane learning, and adorned with short sen∣tences of ancient Fathers, like O's, spangles, or studs of silver. Pomiferis ut apes in saltibus omnia libant, Omnia nos itidem depascimur aurea dicta, Aurea perpetuâ semper dignissima vitâ. THE FIRST BORDER: OR, THE PASSION SERMON. The first presented the Spouse with a Border of gold, with Studs of silver, wrought upon the text, Zech. 13.7. Awake, O sword, against my shep∣heard, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hostes: smite the shepheard, and the sheepe shall be scattered. And thus he put it on: ILlius Doctoris libentiùs audio vocem (saith devout Bernard) non qui si∣bi plausum, sed qui mihi planctum movet.The first Ser∣mon preached on good Friday by master War∣berton now Dean of Wels, abridged. Me thinkes whilest you are here assembled to celebrate the memorie of our Lords death, I see a great concourse as it were to a funerall Sermon; I shall therefore intreat you, Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. to prepare rather your hearts to be woun∣ded, than your eares to be tickled; and at this time to lay aside all expectati∣on either of Art or Learning, and yeeld your selves wholly to religious Passion. It is the observation of St. Austine and Gregorie, that the foure beasts mentioned by St. John, mystically represent the foure maine acts of Christ,Apoc. 4.7. or workes of mans redemption. His 1 Incarnation. 2 Passion. 3 Resurrection. 4 Ascension.
For at his Incarnation he tooke our nature upon him, and was found in shape as a Man: In his passion as a Bullocke he was slaine for sacrifice: In his re∣surrection he was a Lion: In his ascension as an Eagle. We here consider him as a Bullock sacrified upon the altar of the Crosse. Which as it is the greatest myste∣ry that ever was revealed to the world: so the Pen-men of the holy Ghost have bin most laboriously employed to publish it in all ages; figuring it in the Law, fore∣telling it in the Prophesies of the Old Testament, and representing it most live∣ly in the history of the Gospell. I have to doe with a Prophesie somewhat darke before the light of the Gospell shone upon it: Awake, O sword, &c. which words in the Prophet are a Prosopopaeia made by God, or an Apostrophe to his sword to whet it selfe, and be stirred up against a man of meane condition in the estimate of the world, A shepheard: yet in some relation to himselfe, my shepheard: of a strange composition and quality, a man that is my fellow: and it extendeth to the smiting of this shepheard, and scattering his whole flocke. The parts are two, 1 The Speaker, the Lord of hostes. 2 The speech. Wherein observe, 1 Direction; O sword. 2 Matter. Wherein, 1 Incitation. Wherein, 1 The act, Awake. 2 The object; described by 1 His office; shepheard. 2 Person; which is my fellow. 2 Commission. Wherein, 1 The act; smite. 2 The effect; the sheep shalbe scattered. First we are to speake of the Speaker, the Lord of hostes. The Lord of hostes is a name of power, and soundeth like a thunder; his Generall is Death, his great Captaines Plague, Famine, and the Sword, his Arsenall the whole world, and all creatures in heaven, earth and hell his Souldiers, ever ready pressed to fight his battailes. Quantus Deus Dominus exercituum (saith St. Bernard) cui inservit universa creatura? Onely rebelli∣ous man standeth out in such defiance to his Maker, that the creatures which were ordained to be under his dominion, are often awaked, and summoned to be armed for his destruction. Awake, O sword. As all the creatures are Gods souldiers, so when hee imployeth them against man they are called his swords. The wicked is said to be hisPsal. 17.13. sword, and the1 Chron. 21.27. pestilence also. When the Lord is pleased to execute his wrath, he never wanteth instruments or meanes: he hath a sword for Saul,
and an oake for Absalom, and a roape for Achitophel, and a gibbet for Ha∣man, and a worme for Herod: and thus for the generall. The particular intent of the Spirit leadeth mee to another consideration, viz. that of this great blow here threatned to the shepheard, God himselfe is the Author: Deus erat qui pastorem percuti jubebat (saith Maldonat) & quod per alium facit ipse facit. Yea, but God never awaketh his sword to smite but for sinne, and in this shepheard there was no sinne of his owne, the sword therefore lies sleeping in the scabbard, and must now bee summoned to awake. Awake, O sword; Chereb gnuri. To the act of mercy wee are all apt to importune God with clamours, Up Lord: but to the act of justice if we should provoke him, who were able to stand before him? To this he is enforced, after a sort; to provoke himselfe. Wherein observe, first his unwillingnesse to strike, till he is provoked his sword sleepeth: secondly his hast and resolution to strike when he is provoked, in that he will awake his sword. He who is here stiled Lord of hostes, is elsewhere named the Father of mer∣cy; and by his attributes set downe in Exod. 34. ver. 6, 7. it appeareth that he is nine to two more inclineable to mercy than to justice. But because from this hope of mercy many are apt to promise themselves impunity, putting ever from them the evill day, I hold it more needfull at this present to shew his haste and readinesse to execute vengeance upon such who presume too farre upon his long suffering and goodnesse. There is a generation of men described by Da∣vid in the 10. Psalme, ver. 11. that say in their heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face, he will never see it. And by Solomon,Eccles. 8.11. Because sentence against their evill workes is not executed speedily, therefore their heart is fully set in them to doe evill. Ut sit magna tamen certè lenta ira deorum est. To these St. Peter hath answered long agoe,2 Pet. 3.9. The Lord is not slacke (as some men count slacknesse) but is long suffering to us-ward, (that is, the Elect) whose conversion he graciously expecteth. When their number is accomplished, and the sinnes of the Reprobate which now looke white shall turne yellow and grow full ripe, he will awake his sword to wound the heads of his enemies, and his stay in the meane time is but to fetch his arme the further backe, that be may give the sorer stroke; and to draw his arrow to the head, that hee may wound the deeper. For this cause the ancient heathen attributed to God leaden feet, but iron hands; quia tarditatem vindictae gravitate compensat.Tacit. annal. l. 1. In Hateri∣um statim in∣vectus est, at Scaurum, cui implacabiltus irascebatur, silentio trans∣misit. Taci∣tus noteth it of Tiberius Caesar, that being displeased with Q. Haterius and Scaurus, but not equally, he fell foule presently upon Haterius, with whom hee was lesse angry, but said not a word to Scaurus for the present, against whom he conceived irreconcileable haired: so God when he is a little offended at some slips of the godly, hee awaketh his sword presently, but layes it downe a∣gaine after hee hath smote gently with it;Bernard. in Cant. Ser. 42. Hic punit ut illic pareat, & su∣pra omnem miserationem est ira ista: but to the wicked hee giveth line e∣nough, that they may play with the hooke, and swallow it deepe downe with the baite; Hic punit ut illic seviat, & supra omnem iram est miseratio ista. But praised be the Lord of hostes, who to ransome us hath found a man to
wreake his wrath, and turne his sword upon, his shepheard. It is noted ofXiphilin. in vit. Trajan. Trajane, that he would cut his richest robes in pieces to make rags for his souldiers wounds: I shall now propose unto you a man, that to bind up your blee∣ding wounds, hath suffered himselfe to be cut in pieces under the furie of this waking sword. Awake, O sword Against my shepheard. O magne Pastor animarum (saith Bonaventure) pasce animam meam, & ut pascatur meliùs fac ut ipse pascam. Christ is a mighty shepheard, but yet of a little flocke, which was first pent within the walls of Eden, and thence turned out, wandred on the earth till the flood, at the deluge tooke ship and landed in Armenia, from thence removed to Canaan, and from Cannaan to Egypt, and from Egypt backe againe towards Canaan, and after foure hundred yeeres stragling in a strange land, wandred fortie yeares in the wildernesse, and at last was folded in Judaea. In all which crossings, and tur∣nings, and wandrings, he never ceased to feed and fodder them: to give us his substitutes, as well an example by his practice, as a rule by his precept, to feed, feed, and feed. Alimento, verbo, exemplo: quid est amas me? Nisi quaeris in Ecclesia non tua sed mea, (saith St. Austine) nisi testimonium perhibeat conscientia quod plus me ames quam tua, quam tuos, quam te, nequicquam suscipias curam hanc. But if thy conscience assure thee that thou lovest Christ in such sort, then feed thou his flocke as well with in∣tegrity of life, as puritie of doctrine; learne as well facere dicenda, as di∣cere facienda; that is, as Saint Jerome aptly expresseth it, verba vertere in opera. Thou must have engraven on thy breast as well Thummim as Urim, and there must hang as well Pomegranates about thy garment as golden bells. The Popish Writers say that a shepheard should have three things, a scrip, a hooke, and a whistle; but for their owne parts they are so greedy on the scrip, and busie with the hooke, that they forget the whistle, give over their studie and preaching: ac si tum victuri essent sine curâ cum pervenirent ad curam; ma∣king account that all their care is past when they are got into a cure. But the shepheard we speake of was the good shepheard who fed his flocke day and night, and layd downe his life for it: he is the universall shepheard; & ita cu∣rat omnes oves ut singulas. He is here called Gods shepheard, because his di∣spensation is from him, or because he is the beloved of God, and that divine shepheard whichCom. in Evan. Ardeus thus excellently describeth, Educens è lacu miseriae, conducens per viam gratiae, perducens ad pascua gloriae: and shall the sword of the Lord be against this shepheard? The case is different betweene him and David; there it was quid meruerunt oves? here it is quid meruit Pa∣stor? For he was candidus and rubicundus, candidus innocentiâ and rubi∣cundus passione; sine maculâ criminis, & sine rugâ erroris. Had the sword beene awaked against the wolfe it had beene mercy, against the sheepe is had beene justice; but to awake against this good shepheard seemeth to bee hard measure. The case is resolved by Daniel: The Messias shall be slaine, but not for himselfe, God hath layd upon him the iniquity of us all. O in∣effabilis mysterii dispositio! peccat impius, & patitur justus: meretur malus, patitur bonus: quod committit homo sustinet Deus. Here then you see the first and maine cause of the shepheards slaughter, your sinnes. It is in vaine to shift it off on Judas or Pilat, and most impious to lay it upon
the Lord of hostes. For solum peccatum homicida est: so that I may bring it home to the bosome of every one of you in the words of Nathan, Tu es ho∣mo, Thou art the man that hast slaine this shepheard. O consider this, yee that forget God; doe not so wickedly as to commit a second murder upon this good shepheard, crucifie not againe the Lord of life: every reviling speech to your neighbour is a whip on his side, every traducing of your superi∣ours a crowne of thornes to his head, every neglect of charity to his members new nailes to wound his hands and feet, every blasphemous word a new spit∣ting on his face, every oath a speare to pierce his heart. But what moved him to become our surety and sacrifice? No reason can be given but his will, Oblatus est quia voluit, He was offered because hee would, hee would because hee loved us: and to the end hee might the better undergoe his office, because it became us to have such an high Priest that had feeling of our wants and infirmities, he became man. The man. The Hebrewes have foure severall words for a man, Adam, Enosh, Ish, Geber; Adam signifying red earth, Enosh, a man of sorrow, Ish, a man of a noble spirit, Geber, a strong man; wee have found a man here in all these senses. Adam, earth as wee; Enosh, a man of sorrowes; Ish, a man of a noble spirit, to encounter all the powers of darkenesse; Geber, a strong man, stronger than hee in theMat. 12.29. Gospell, which first possessed the house. Behold the man, saith Pilat: but a man of sorrow, saith Esay: nay, a worme and no man, saith David: nay lesse resisting than a worme; for a worme if it bee trod upon will turne againe: but this man went like a lambe to the slaughter: or, if hee may rightly be termed a worme, certainely a silke-worme, spinning us a precious web of righteousnesse out of his owne bowels: yet this worme and no man is Ish, one of noble spirit; and Geber, a valiant man: yea, such an one as is Gods fellow. My fellow. For in him the Godhead dwelleth bodily, and in him all the Saints are compleat: he is the brightnesse of his Fathers glory, and the en∣graven forme of his person. —ipse paterni Pectoris effigies, lumen{que} a lumine vero. Semper cum patre, semper de patre, semper in patre, semper apud pa∣trem, semper quod pater, saith Fulgentius: ex ipso, cum ipso, hoc quod ipse, saith Saint Austine: who being in the forme of God thought it notPhil. 2.6. robberie to bee equall with God; and therefore God calleth him here his fellow. Such a one i became him to be, that was to encounter principalities, to come upon the strong man (whereby is meant the Divell) and binde him, and spoile his goods; to grapple with the great King of feare, Death; to say to hell and the grave, Effata; to swallow up the swallower of all things, to destroy destruction, and to lead captivitie captive, and to returne with glo∣ry from thence unde negant quenquam redire. Againe, my fellow, yet a man; creator matris, creatus ex matre, saith Saint Austine: ipsum sanguinem quem pro matre obtulit, ante de san∣guine matris accepit, saith Emissenus. Hee that was the brightnesse of his Father, and such a brightnesse as no man could behold and live, hath
now a traverse drawne over his glorie: the word is made flesh, sepositâ non depositâ majestate, saith Emissenus: naturam suscipiendo nostram, non amittendo suam, saith Saint Austine: ad terrena descendit, & coe∣lestia non deseruit, hic affuit, & inde non defuit: and so be became Em∣manuel, God with us, perfect God, and perfect man: man to receive sup∣plications from man, God to deliver them to God: man to suffer for man, God to satisfie God. Apparuit medius (saith Saint Austine) in∣ter mortales peccatores, & immortalem justum mortalis justus; morta∣lis cum hominibus, justus cum Deo: ne vel in utroque similis longè es∣set à Deo, aut in utroque dissimilis longè esset ab hominibus. To con∣clude this point, Gods fellow to offer an infinite sacrifice for all mankinde, and a man that he might be himselfe the sacrifice killed by the sword which is now awaked to smite him. 1 Smite the Shepheard. Hachharogneh, hacke him, hew him, butcher him. Now are the reines let loose to all the powers of darkenesse, now is the sword flying about the Shepheards eares, now have they power to hurrie him from Annas to Caiaphas, from Caiaphas to Pilat, from Pilat to Herod, from Herod againe to Pilat, and so to Calvarie; and in every passage appears a sword that might cleave asunder a heart of Adamant: yet the Lord of hostes saith still 2 Smite him. Now hath Judas power to betray him, the Priests to con∣vent him, the standers by to buffet him, the officers to whip him, the people to deride him, Pilat to condemne him; and in every act appeares a sword that might cleave in sunder a heart of rocke: yet the Lord of hostes saith still 3 Smite him. Now the thornes have power to goare him, the whip to lash him, the nailes to fasten him, the speare to pierce him, the Crosse to extend him, the grave to swallow him; and in every one appeares a sword that might cleave in sunder a heart of steele: yet the Lord of hostes saith still 4 Smite him. Let no part bee free from torment; not his head from pricking, nor his face from spitting, nor his flesh from whipping, nor his pal∣lat from vinegar, nor his hands and feet from piercing, nor his heart from the speare: yet still the Lord of hostes saith 5 Smite him. The torment of his body was but the body of his torment, the soule of his torment was his soules torment. Now his soule is troubled, saith John; nay, exceeding sorrowfull, saith Marke; nay, heavie unto death, saith Matthew: all the streames of bloud that issued from him on the Crosse were nothing to his drops in the garden: those were forced with out∣ward violence, these were drained out with inward sorrow. Sure (saith one) he was neare some fornace that melted him. Here was a blow that if he had not beene Gods fellow would have strucke him downe to hell: yet the Lord of hostes saith 6 Smite him. The sense of paine is not so grievous as the want of com∣fort. Here all comfort is with-held; the people deride him, and preferre a murderer before him: of his owne people and servants, one betrayeth him, another denies him, all forsake him: all this is nothing in comparison. For friends are but earthly comforts, but that his Father from heaven should
forsake him, here is the sword that cleaveth his heart, and maketh up the full measure of the blow. In the very heat of his passion hee tooke no notice of any other torment but this onely, that his God had forsaken him. It is wonderfull that never any Martyr brake forth into the like speech, notwithstanding all their ex∣quisite torments: but the reason is assigned by St. Austine, Martyres non eripuit, nunquid deseruit? By this time I know you expect the fulnesse of the blow; vox faucibus hae∣ret, it is death, the ignominious death of the Crosse. Vexed he was before his death, tortured in his death, wounded after his death; hic salus pati∣tur, fortitudo infirmatur, vita moritur. Now the Angels stand amazed at the blow, the earth trembles, the stones are cleft, and the vaile of the Tem∣ple rends, and the people smite their breasts: now are blackes hung all a∣bout the galleries of heaven; the Sunne hath put on a darke vaile, inso∣much that a Philosopher, as farre from his hearse as from his faith, takes notice of this great Gods funerall. And to make up the companie of true mourners, the grave sendeth forth her dead, and corpse arise and enter in∣to the holy Citie: now is his hearse set without the gate, that they that are without, even dogs, may see him, and make songs of him; and lest any should be ignorant whose hearse it was, his title is set up in Hebrew, Greeke and Latine. O tell it not in Gath, publish it not in Askelon, lest the uncircumcised rejoyce to see the glory of Israel obscured: nunc, nunc vires exprime dolor, solitum flendi vincito morem. If it be true, that the Hebrewes have no word for eyes but what serves for springs, it seemeth that all the eyes the holy Lan∣guage speaketh of, should be like springs, wherewith they should bewaile him whom they have pierced: yet there is better use of this than to lament. O consider this and rejoyce; weepe for him, but rejoyce for your selves. When the glittering sword in the hand of the Lord was lift up, and his arme stretched out utterly to destroy you, this Shepheard steppeth in, and standeth betweene, and in his owne body receiveth the blow that was aimed at you. O consider you this, for whom the Shepheard hath suffered such things. First, acknowledge with reverence the singular justice of God, that could not be satisfied but with such a ransome. Secondly, acknowledge with de∣testation the hideousnesse of your sinnes, that deserved so great a ransome. Thirdly, acknowledge the uneffable love of this blessed shepheard that payd this great ransome. On the other side, consider this and tremble, yee that forget God; yee have no interest in this Shepheards death: looke to your selves in time, antequam exeat ira apprehendite disciplinam, osculamini filium. The Shep∣heard is smiten, if you looke to it in time it may be for you; if not, a worse disaster remaineth for you than befell these sheepe: you shall be confounded, they were but scattered. The sheepe shall be scattered. This Prophesie hath speciall relation to their temporall flight, but it extendeth also to their amazement and stagge∣ring at the heavinesse of the blow. They trusted that it had beene hee that should have redeemed Israel; but now through his blow they are fallen from their trust. The Sunne labours in the eclipse, no ray appeares, hee cannot bee
discerned to be the Sonne of God, all candles were quite blowne out this night, unlesse it were, as Allensis affirmeth, that of Virgin waxe; and whether it had any light in it I cannot say, certainely the sword went through her heart too. But disperguntur tantum, non destruuntur oves, these sheepe shortly met a∣gaine, and suffered much with great constancie for their shepheard. Peter and Andrew were crucified, James beheaded, the other James brained with a Fullers club, all martyred save John; yet in all these deathes they were more than conquerours: sanguis Martyrum semen Evangelii, the bloud they spilt was as oyle to feed the lampes of the Church, or as dew to fatten her soyle. Let no man therefore be deterred at the mention of the Crosse; it is like the man in armour that appeared to Josuah, who seemed dreadfull at the first, but in the end proved a friend. O bone Jesu, ubicunque fueris, in praesepi, in horto, in cruce, in sepulchro, non curo, modo te inveniam; O sweet Jesu, wheresoever thou art, in the manger, in the garden, in the crosse, in the sepulchre, I care not what befalls me, so I may finde thee. Thus have I presented unto you the gift which the first Speaker tende∣red to the Spouse of Christ, a border of gold, with studs of silver: no∣thing remaines but that I worke an embleme of the giver in his gift. Eve∣ry embleme consisteth of an image and a motto; the Image shall be Sul∣pitius, the motto Tullies testimonie of him in his booke De claris oratori∣bus. Maximè grandis, &, ut it a dicam, tragicus Orator; incitata & volubi∣lis, nec redundans tamen oratio; vox magna & suavis, gestus venustus; he was a loftie, and, if I may so speake, a tragicall Oratour; his speech was full and fluent, yet not redundant; his voyce great and sweet, his gesture comely. THE SECOND BORDER: OR, THE RIGHTEOUS MAMMON. The second border of gold, which the second Speaker offred to the Spouse, was wrought upon that text of Scripture, which we finde, 1 Tim. 6.17. Charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-min∣ded, nor trust in uncertaine riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy. Ver. 18. That they doe good, that they be rich in good workes, ready to distri∣bute,The second Sermon, prea∣ched by Doctor Hall, now Lord Bishop of Ex∣on, abridged. willing to communicate. And thus he put it on. Right Honourable, Right Reverend, &c. THose things which are most necessary in their use, are most dangerous in their miscarriage. And therefore nothing is more necessarie for a
Christian, than to be rectified in the managing of a prosperous estate, and to learne so to manage his happinesse here, that hee may be happier hereafter: which this text undertakes to teach, where Timothie is set as it were upon the Bench to give the charge: Charge. A charge, to whom? To the rich. Of what? 1 What they must avoyd: 1 High-mindednesse; because their wealth is in this world. 2 Trust in wealth; because their riches are uncertaine. 2 What they must endeavour and labour for: 1 Confidence in God; because he is a living and liberall God. 2 Beneficence to men; because by this they lay up to themselves a sure foundation. Here, said the Preacher, is worke enough for my discourse and your pra∣ctice: I feare more than enough for my rehearsing. The God of heaven, who blessed it in his hands, blesse it now in mine, who have it but at the se∣cond hand. Charge. Charge, Janus-like, hath a double aspect; the one that lookes up to Saint Paul, the other that lookes downe to Timothie, and from him to the rich. In the first there is Apostolicall superioritie, in the second Epi∣scopall power, and Evangelicall sufficiencie. For the first, charge thou, re∣ferres to, I charge thee, ver. 13. so Paul chargeth Timothie to charge the rich. The first foundation of the Church was layd in an inequalitie, and hath ever since so continued. There can be no harmonie where all the strings and voyces are of one tenour: hee that giveth the charge, if hee be not the chiefe of the Bench, yet hee is greater than the Jurie: the rich are commonly great: Nobility in the account of God is joyned with wealth. Curse not the King in thy thought, nor the rich in thy bed chamber, saith Solo∣mon. So Dives, at whose gates Lazarus lay, is by some (no meane ones) ghessed to be Herod, or some other King; and so are Jobs friends termed by the Seventie. Yea, the rich is not onely a little King among his neigh∣bours; but dives, quasi divus, as a pettie god to his underlings: yet Timothie hath authoritie to charge and command such rich. That foolish shaveling soared too high a pitch, when in his imperious Bull hee commanded the Angels: but wee may safely say all powers below the Angels are liable to our spirituall charge, and the power of the keyes which Christ hath gi∣ven us. But what now becommeth of them? that I may not say in some of our hands they are suffered to rust for want of use, in others, as the Pontifici∣ans, the wards are altered, so as they can neither open nor shut: Sure I am the power of them is lost in the hearts of many, they have secret picke∣lockes of their owne making, presumption and securitie; whereby they can open heaven gates, though double locked by our censures, and shut the gates of hell at pleasure, which their owne sinnes have opened wide to re∣ceive them. What use then is there of us but in our chaire? and there but
to be heard and seene? Even in this sense spectaculo facti sumus, we are to gaze on, and not to implie. Yet it was well noted by one, that the good father of the Prodigall, though he might himselfe have brought forth the prime robe, or have led his sonne into the wardrobe to take it, yet he com∣mands his servants to bring it forth, because hee would have his sonne to be beholden to his servants for his glorie. He that can save you without us, will not save you but by us. Hitherto the power implyed in the charge: the sufficiencie followes. This E∣vangelicus must be Parangelicus: Like as the forerunner of Christ had a charge for all sorts, so hath Timothie in this epistle a charge for wives, for husbands, for Bishops, for Deacons, for Widowes, for Servants, and here for the rich. And I am perswaded that no Nation under heaven ever had more sufficient Timothies, to instruct all sorts of men in the wayes of salvation, than this our Land: so that what Jerome spake sometime of Britaine, is now most true, com∣paring it with Jerusalem as it had beene; De Hierosolymis & de Britannia e∣qualiter patet aula coelestis. For the Northren parts, since his sacred Majesty in his last journey (as if the Sun did out of compassion goe beyond his tropicke line to give heat to that climate) visited them, are better provided of Preachers, and maintenance for Preachers, and both Pastours and people professe them∣selves mutually blessed in each other, and blesse God and their King for their blessednesse. And as for the Southerne, when I behold them me thinkes I see the Firmament in a cleere night bespangled with goodly Starres of all magni∣tudes, that yeeld a pleasant diversity of light unto the earth; but above all, this Citie is rich in this spirituall provision. Other Cities may exceed you in the glory of outward structure, in the largenesse of extent, in the uniforme pro∣portion of streets, or ornaments of Temples: but your pulpits are past theirs; and if preaching can lift up Citizens to heaven, yee are not upon earth. Heare this, O yee Citizens, and bee not proud, but thankefull unto God. I adde also to your Preachers, no vice more hatefull to God and man than ingratitude, no ingratitude more abominable than to parents, no pa∣rents ought to be dearer unto you than those who have begot you through the Gospell in Christ. Charge them: But whom? The rich. The rich. Who are rich? According to Moralitie and Christianity, they that have enough with content: so saith the Apostle, Godlinesse is great gaine, if a man be content with that which he hath. St. Jerome saith, vi∣ctus & vestitus divitiae Christianorum. According to the vulgar use of the word, they are rich who have more than is necessarie. Now there is a double necessitie, of nature, of estate: that is necessarie to nature, without which wee cannot live; that is necessarie to estate which is superfluous to nature, and that which were superfluous to nature, is not so much as necessary to estate: nature goes single, and beares little breadth; estate goes ever with a traine: the ne∣cessity of nature admits little difference, especially for quantity; the necessity of estate requires as many diversities, as there are several degrees of humane con∣ditions, and severall circumstances in those degrees. Thus understanding what is meant by the word, come we now to the matter. Man that came naked out of the womb of the earth, was even then so rich, that all things were his:
heaven was his roofe, or canopie, the earth his floore, the Sea his pond, the Sunne and Moone his torches, all creatures his vassals: and if he lost the ful∣nesse of this Lordship by being a slave to sinne, yet we have still dominium gratificum, as Gerson termeth it. In this sense every sonne of Abraham is heire of the world: but to make up the true reputation of wealth (for thus we may be, as having all things and possessing nothing) another right is required besides spirituall, which is a civill and humane right: wherein I doubt not but our learned Wickliffe, and Armacanus, and Gerson, have had much wrong, whilest they are accused to teach that men in these earthly things have no tenure but grace, no title but charitie; which questionlesse they intended in foro interiori, in the consistorie of God, not in the com∣mon pleas of men; in the court of conscience, not in the courts of Law. For it is certaine that besides this spirituall right there is a civill right in earth∣ly things: and the Scripture speaking secundum jus gentium, whereon the division of these earthly possessions is grounded, calleth some poore, some rich. The Apostle saith not, charge men that they be not rich, but, charge the rich that they be not high minded. The rich. In this one word, and as it were with one graspe, the Apostle crusheth the heads of two heresies, the ancient Apostolici, who denied the lawfulnesse of earthly proprieties; and our late Popish votaries, who place holinesse in want and povertie. Did these men never heare that the blessing of God maketh rich? that the wise mans wealth is his strong Citie? If Lazarus was poore, yet Abraham was rich: & pi∣um pauperem suscepit sinus divitis, in divitiis cupiditatem reprehendit, non facultatem, saith Austine. Bona est substantia si non sit peccatum in conscientia, substance doth well in the hand, if there be no evill in the heart. Let the rich take heed how he became so:Ecclus. 13.25. that God which can allow you to be rich, will not allow you all wayes to your wealth: hee hath set up a gol∣den goale to which he allowes you all to runne, but you must keepe the beaten rode of honestie, justice, charitie and truth. If you will leave this path, and by crossing over a shorter cut through by-wayes of your owne, you may be rich with a vengeance. The heathen Poet Menander could observe , which Solomon may seeme to translate, saying,Pro. 28.22. Hee that makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent. It were envious and in∣finite to arraigne all sorts of fraud, usurie, and extortion, whereby many become oversoone rich: let me shut up all together in that fearefull sentence of Solomon, The gathering of treasures by a deceitfull tongue is a vanitie,Pro. 21.6. tossed to and fro of them that seeke death; and the robberie of the wic∣ked shall destroy them. Search your chests, search your hearts, all yee that heare mee this day; and if any of you finde any of this adulterine gold among your heapes, away with it, as you love your selves away with it; else know that (as Chrysostome saith wittily) yee have locked up a theefe in your counting house, which will carry away all; and, if you looke not to it the sooner, your soule with it. Have a care of this yee that are rich In the world. As Saint John distinguisheth betweene being in the Church, and of the Church, so St. Paul of rich in the world, and of the world. Those are the rich of the world which are worldlings in heart as well as in estate; those are rich in the world whose estate is below, though their hearts may be a∣bove: the rich of the world are in it, but the rich in the world are not necessarily
of it. If Timothie or St. Paul should have charged the rich of the world, he had charmed a deafe adder; yea perhaps, even with this charge, like a rusty or ill wrought piece, they had recoyled in his face with those Athenians, What will this babler say? To the other sort therefore, whose hearts are not in their bags, Timothies charge and my speech is directed. Let these heare, first, their condition; secondly, their duty: their condition, they are rich; but in this world. This clause serves, 1 For distinction. As St. Austine distinguisheth of pauper in animo, and pauper in sacculo, so may we of spirituall wealth, and secular, and worldly. This latter is valued by pieces of earth, and one mouthfull of earth maketh an end of all: that which the worldly man dotes and dreames of is but even Ne∣buchadnezzars Image, a composition of metall, and the foot of all is clay. Earthly men tread upon their felicitie, and yet have not the wit to contemne it, and to seeke a better, which is the spirituall wealth; the cabbinet whereof is the soule, and the treasure in it God himselfe. O happy resolution of that bles∣sed Father, Omnis mihi copia quae Deus meus non est, egestas est. 2 This serves for limitation.  as it is absolutely taken, quasi , signifieth eternity, but restrained with a  it is scarce a time; yet this is the utmost extent of worldly wealth, the short space of humane life. All our crownes, and soveraines, and pieces, and halfe pieces, and duckats, and double duckats are currant but to the brimme of the grave, there they cease: and wee justly laugh at the folly of those easterne Pagans, who put coyne into a dead mans hand for his provision in another world. What should we doe therefore, if we will be provident Travellers, but make over our mo∣ney here, to receive it by exchange in the world to come? It is our Saviours counsell, Make you friends of unrighteous mammon, &c. And as an an∣cient Father saith sweetly, If you will be wise Merchants, thriftie and happie Usurers, part with that which you cannot keepe, that you may gaine that which you cannot lose. Which that you may doe, hearken to the duties which God layes upon you: the first whereof is the remover of evill; That you be not high minded. It is strange to see how this earthly drosse, which is of it selfe heavie, and therefore naturally sinkes downeward, should raise up the heart of man; yet it commonly carries a man up even to a double pitch of pride, one above others, the other above himselfe: above others in contempt, above himselfe in over-weening. The man with a gold ring (in Saint James) looketh to sit highest. And not to cast backe your eyes, doe we not see it thus in our times? If a man bee but worth a foote∣cloth, how big he looketh on the inferiour passengers? and if hee hath pur∣chased a little more land and title, you shall see it in his garbe: whatso∣ver he doth he is not as he was, nor as the Pharisee sayes, like other men: hee lookes upon vulgar men as if they were made to serve him, and should thinke themselves happie to be commanded by him: and if hee be crossed a little he swels like the Sea in a storme. Neither doth this pride raise a man more above others than above himselfe; and what wonder if hee will not know his poore neighbours, who hath forgot himselfe? As Saul was changed into another man presently upon his annoynting; so is it with them upon their advancement, now it may not be taken as it hath beene. Other
carriage, other fashions are fitter for them, their attire, fare, retinue, houses, furniture displease them, new must be had, together with coaches and lackies, and all the equipage of greatnesse. These things I dislike not simply, they are fit for those that are fit for them: charity is not strait-la∣ced, but yeelds much latitude to the lawfull use of things indifferent: but it is the heart that makes all these things evill, when it is puffed up with these windie vanities, and hath learned to borrow that part of the Divels speech, All these things are mine: and can say with him that was turned into a beast, Is not this great Babel which I have built? If there be here any of these empty bladders that are puffed up with the wind of conceit, give me leave to pricke them a little. And First, let me tell them that they may have much, and be never the better. The chimney overlookes all the rest of the house; is it not for all that the ve∣ry basest piece of the building? The heathen man could observe, that God gives many a man wealth for the greater mischiefe; as the Israelites were rich in Quailes, but their sauce was such, that famine had beene better. Ha∣man was proud that he alone was called to the honour of Queene Hesters feast, this advancement raised him fiftie cubits higher to a stately gibbet. If your wealth be to any of you an occasion of falling, if your gold be turned into fet∣ters, it had beene better for you to have lived beggars. Secondly, let me tell them that they are proud of that which is none of theirs. For Philo's observation is most true, That God onely by a propriety is stiled the possessour of heaven and earth by Melchizedech in his speech to Abraham: we are onely tenants, and that at the will of the Lord. Wee have but jus ad rem, not dominion in rem; a right onely of favour from the proprietarie and Lord in heaven, and that liable to account. Doe we not laugh at the Groome that is proud of his masters horse? Or some vaine Whifler that is proud of a borrowed chaine? So ridiculous are we to be puffed up with that whereof we must needs say with the poore man of the hatchet, Alas ma∣ster it is but borrowed. Therefore if God have laden any of you with these earthly riches, be you like unto the full eare of corne, hang downe your heads in true humilitie towards the earth, from which we came. Hitherto of the high-mindednesse that followes wealth: now where our pride is, there will be our confidence; which is forbidden in the next place. And trust not in uncertain riches. To trust in riches is to set our heart on them, to place our joy and contentment in them; in a word, to make them our best friend, our patron, our idoll, our God. This the true and jealous God will not abide, and yet nothing is more ordinarie. The rich mans wealth is his strong Citie, saith Solomon: and where should a man thinke himselfe safe but in his fort? Silver answereth to all, saith Solomon; that we grant, al∣though we would be loath it should answer to truth, to justice, to judgement: but yet mammon vants to conquer all, according to the old Greeke verse, fight with silverlances, and you cannot faile of victorie: to pacifie all,. (for a gift in the bosome appeases wrath) to procure all secular offices, titles and dignities, I would I might not say claves altaria Christum. And let me tell you indeed what mammon can doe; He can unbarre the gates of hell to the un∣conscionable soule, and helpe his followers to damnation: this he can doe: but for other things, howsoever with us men the foolish silver-smithes may shout
out, Great is mammon of the worldlings; yet if wee weigh his power a∣right, we shall conclude of mammon as Paracelsus doth of the Divell, that he is a base and beggarly Spirit. For what I beseech you can he doe? Can he make a man honest, or wise, or healthy? Can he give a man to live more mer∣rily, feed more heartily, sleepe more quietly? Can he buy off the gout, cares, death, much lesse the paines of another world?Pro. 11.4. Riches availe not in the day of wrath: if we leane upon this reed it shall breake, and runne into our hands. He that trusteth in riches shall fall, Prov. 11.28. Take heed therefore, as you love your soules, how you bestow your trust upon riches: you may use them, and serve your selves of them: yea, yee may enjoy them in a Christian moderation; God will allow it. That praise which the Jesuits Colledge in Gra∣nado gives of their Sanchez, that though he lived where they had a very sweet garden, yet he was never seene to touch a flower; and that he would rather die than eat salt, or pepper, or ought that might give rellish to his meat; like to that of some other Monkes, that they would not see the Sunne, nor shift their clothes, nor cleanse their teeth; carries in it more superstition and slaverie than wit or grace. Wherefore hath God made these creatures but for use? This niggardlinesse is injurious to the bounty of their Maker. We may use them, we may not trust in them: we may serve our selves of them, we may not serve them: we may enjoy them, we may not over joy in them. We must be so affected to our goods as Theodorick the good King of Aquitaine was with his play, in bonis jactibus tacet, in malis ridet, in neutris irascitur, in utrisque philosophatur. But if we will be making our wealth a rivall unto God, the jealousie of God shall burne like fire against us. Now as the disdainefull ri∣vall will be sure to cast reproaches upon his base competitor, so doth God upon riches, hee calleth them uncertaine, yea uncertaintie it selfe. Trust not in Uncertaine riches. Were our wealth tied to our life it were uncertaine e∣nough: for what is that but a flower, a vapour, a tale, a shadow, a dreame of a shadow, a thought, a nothing? Yet our riches are more uncertaine than life it selfe: our life flies hastily away, but many times our riches have longer wings, and out flie it. It was a wittie observation of Basil, in Psal. 61. , &c. that wealth rowles along by a man like as a headie streame glides by the bankes: time will molder away the very banke it washeth, but the current stayes not for that, but speeds from one elbow of earth to another: so doth wealth, even whilest we stay it is gone. Our life is as the tree, our wealth is as the leaves or fruit; the tree stands still when the leaves are fallen. Yea, ma∣ny one is like the Pine tree, which, they say, if his barke be pulled off lasteth long, else it rots. If therefore life and wealth strive together whether is more uncertaine, wealth will sure carry it away. Job was yesterday the richest man in the East, to day he is so needy, that he is gone into a Proverbe, As poore as Job. Belisarius the great and famous Commander, to whom Rome owed her life twice at least, came to date obolum Belisario, give one halfe penny to Beli∣sarius. O miserable uncertainty of this earthly pelfe, that stands upon so ma∣ny hazzards, yea, that falls under them! who would trust it? who can dote upon it? what madnesse is it in those men which (as Menot sayes) like unto hunters, that kill an horse of price in the pursuit of an hare worth nothing, en∣danger, yea cast away their soules upon this worthlesse and fickle trash. Glasses
are pleasing vessels, yet because of their brittlenesse who esteemes them preci∣ous? nor flowers, though beautifull, because they are fading? No wise man bestowes much cost in painting mud walls: what meane we (my beloved) to spend our lives and hearts upon these perishing treasures? It was a wise me∣ditation of Nazianzen to his Asterius, that good is to no purpose, if it con∣tinue not: yea, there is no pleasant thing in the world, saith he, that hath so much joy in the welcome, as it hath sorrow in the farewell. Looke therefore upon these heapes, O yee wise hearted Citizens, with carelesse eyes, as those things whose parting is certaine, whose stay is uncertaine; and say with the worthie Father, By all my wealth, and glory, and greatnesse, this alone have I gained, that I had something to which I might preferre my Saviour; with whose words I conclude this point. Lay not up for your selves treasures on earth, where moth and rust doe corrupt, and theeves breake thorow and steale; but lay up for your selves treasure in heaven. But trust in God. Man cannot be without a stay, and therefore the same breath that withdrawes one refuge from us, substitutes a better: even as a good Carpenter in stead of a rotten groundsill layes a sound. The same trust then must we give to God, which we must not give to riches him must we esteeme a∣bove all things, looke up to him in all things, depend upon him for all things. This is to trust in God, which the Psalmist in his sweet dittie saith is a good thing: good in respect of God; for our trust in him is one of the best pieces of his glorie: (Joseph holds Potiphars trust a great honour.) 2. For us; for what safety, what unspeakable comfort is therein trusting to God? Our Saviour in his farewell Sermon, John 16. perswading to confidence, saith,  a word signifying boldnesse: and what is there in all the world that can worke the heart to so comfortable and unconquerable resolution, as our reposall upon God? The Lord is my trust, whom then can I feare? They that put their trust in the Lord, are as mount Sion that cannot be moved. Oh cast your selves there∣fore into those almighty hands, seeke him in whom you shall finde true rest and happinesse, honour him with your substance that hath honoured you with it: trust not in riches, but trust in God. Riches are but for this world, the true God is Lord of the other; therefore trust in him: riches are uncertaine, the true God is Amen, ever like himselfe; ergo trust in him: riches are meere passive, they cannot bestow so much as themselves, much lesse ought besides themselves; the true God gives you all things to enjoy: riches are but a livelesse and senselesse metall, God is The living God. Life is an ancient and usuall title of God; he for the most part sweares by it. When Moses asked his name, he described himselfe by I am: He is, he liveth; and nothing is, and nothing lives absolutely but he: all other things by participation from him. In all other things their life and they are two, but God is his owne life: and therefore (as Aquinas acutely disputeth against the Gentiles) must needs be eternall, because beeing cannot be severed from it self. Howbeit, not only the life he hath in himselfe, but the life which he giveth to his creatures, challengeth a part in this title. A glympse whereof the heathen had when they called Jupiter , from  Those creatures which have life we esteem beyond those that have it not, how noble soever other waies those things be. Ther∣fore he that hath the perfectest life must needs be the best. God therefore who is life it self, & fountain of all that life which is in the world, is most worthy of all: the
adoration, joy, love and confidence of our hearts, and the best improvement of that life which he hath given us. Trust therefore in the living God, not in riches; that is idolatrie, yea madnesse. What greater madnesse can there be than to bestow that life which we have from God, upon a creature that hath no life in it selfe, nor price but from men? Let me then perswade every soule that heares me this day as Jacob did his houshold; Put away the strange gods that are among you: or as St. Paul did his Lystrians; O turne away from these vanities to the living God, who gives us richly All things to enjoy. Every word would require, not a severall houre, but a life to meditate upon; and the tongues, not of men, but of Angels to expresse it. God not onely hath all in himselfe, but he gives to us; and gives us not somewhat, but all things; and not a little of all, but richly: and all this not to looke on, but to enjoy. (Here the Preacher said it should content him to top the sheaves onely, because he could not stand to thresh them out: it shall content me with the Apostles to rub some few eares, because I cannot stand to top the sheaves) Whither can you turne your eyes to looke besides the bounty of God? If you looke upwards, his mercie reacheth to the heavens; if downewards, the earth is full of his goodnesse; and so is the broad sea: if you looke about you, what is it that he hath not given us? aire to breathe in, fire to warme us, water to coole us, cloathes to cover us, food to nourish us, fruits to refresh us, yea, delicates to please us, beasts to serve us, Angels to attend us, heaven to receive us, and (which is above all) his sonne to redeeme us. Lastly, if we looke into our selves, hath he not given us a soule rarely fur∣nished with the faculties of understanding, will, memorie and judgement? a body wonderfully accommodated to execute the charge of the soule? and an estate that yeelds due conveniencies for both? moreover, seasonable times, peace, competencie, if not plentie of all commodities, good lawes, religious, wise, just Governours, happie and flourishing dayes, and above all the liberty of the Gospell? More particularly, cast up your Bookes, O yee Citizens, and summe up your receits; I am deceived if he that hath least shall not confesse his obligation to be infinite. There are three things especially wherein yee are beyond others, and must acknowledge your selves deeper in the bookes of God than the rest of the world. First, for your deliverance from that wofull judgement ef the Pestilence. O remember those sorrowfull times, when every moneth swept away thousands from among you, when a man could not set forth his foot but into the jawes of death, when piles of carcasses were carried to their pits, as dung to the fields, when it was crueltie in the sicke to admit visitation, and love was little better than murderous. Secondly, for your wonderfull plentie of all provisions spirituall and bodi∣ly. Yee are like the Sea, all the Rivers of the land runne into you; nay, sea and land conspire to enrich you. Thirdly, for the priviledge of your governement: your charters, as they are large and strong, so your forme of administration is excellent, and the ex∣ecution of justice exemplarie. For all these you have reason to aske with Da∣vid, Quid retribuam? and to trust in God who hath beene so gracious unto you. And thus from the duty we owe to God in our confidence, and his benefi∣cence to us, we descend to the beneficence which we owe to men, expressed in the
varietie of foure epithetes to one sense. To doe good, to be rich in good workes, ready to distribute, willing to communicate: all is but beneficence. This heape of words shewes the ve∣hement intention of his desire of good workes, and the important necessitie of the performance; and the manner of this expression enforceth no lesse: Charge the rich, &c. Hearken then, yee rich men of the world, it is not left arbitrarie to you, that you may doe good if you will; but it is layd upon you as your charge and dutie: the same necessity there is of trusting in God, is of doing good to men. Let me fling this stone at the brasen forehead of our Romish Adversaries, whom their shamelesse challenges of our religion, dare tell the world, that wee are all for faith, and that wee hold workes to salvation as a parenthesis to a sentence. Heaven and earth shall witnesse the injustice of this calumnia∣tion, and your consciences shall be our compurgatours this day, which shall te∣stifie to you, both now and on your death-bed, that wee have taught you there is no lesse necessitie of good workes, than if you should bee saved by them: and that though you cannot be saved by them, as the meritorious causes of your glory, yet that you cannot be saved without them, as the ne∣cessary effects of that grace which brings glory. Indeed we doe not hover o∣ver your expiring soules at your death beds, as Ravens over a carkasse; we doe not beg for a covent, nor fright you with Purgatorie, nor chaffer with you for that invisible treasure of the Church, whereof there is but one key keeper at Rome: but we tell you, that the making of friends with this Mammon of unrighteousnesse is the way to eternall habitations. They say of Cyrus, that he was wont to say, He layd up treasure for himselfe when hee made his friends rich: but we say to you, that you lay up treasures for your selves in heaven, whilest you make the poore your friends on earth. Hee shall never be Gods heire in heaven, who lendeth him nothing on earth. As the wittie Poet sayd of extreme tall men, that they were like Cypresse trees, , so may I say of a straithanded rich man: and these Cypresses are not for the Garden of Paradise. None shall be ever planted there but the fruitfull: and if the first Paradise had any trees in it onely for pleasure, I am sure the second, which is in the midst of the new Jerusa∣lem, shall have no tree that beares not twelve fruits; yea, whose very leaves are not beneficiall. Doe good therefore, O yee rich, and shew your wealth to be (not in having, but) in doing good: and so doe it, that wee may thanke you (not your death-bed) for it. Late beneficence is better than none, but so much as early beneficence is better than late. He that gives not till he dies, shewes that he would not give if he could keepe it. That which you give thus, you give it by your testament, I can scarce say you give it by your will. The good mans praise is dispersit, dedit, he disperses his goods, not he left them behinde him: and his distribution is seconded with the retribution of God, His righteousnesse endureth for ever, Psal. 112.9. Our Saviour tells us, that our good workes are our light: Let your light so shine, that men may see your good workes. Which of you lets his light goe behind him, and hath it not rather carried before him, that he may see which way it goes, and which way himselfe goes by it? Doe good therefore in your life, that you may have comfort in your death, and a crowne of life after death.
Here the Preacher filled up his border with the gifts of this Citie, as it were so many precious stones: in stead whereof, because I am not ap∣pointed to rehearse your deeds, but the Preachers Sermon, I will fill it up with the praises of the Speaker. His sentences were verè lineae aureae, (according to Junius his translation of my text) cum punctis argenteis; the latter whereof interlaced his whole discourse. It remaineth that as I have done in the former, so I worke the embleme of the giver in his gift. The Image shall be Marcus Callidius, the Motto or words the words of Tul∣lie, De claris Oratoribus. Orator non unus è multis, sed inter multos sin∣gularis; reconditas exquisitasque sententias mollis & perlucens vestiebat oratio. Nihil tam tenerum quam illius comprehensio verborum, quae ita pura erat, ut nihil liquidius; ita liberè fluebat, ut nusquam adhaeresceret; nullum nisi in loco positum, & tanquam emblemate vermiculato verbum structum videres: accedebat ordo rerum plenus artis, actio liberalis, totum{que} dicendi genus placidum & sanum. THE THIRD BORDER: OR HORTUS DELI∣CIARUM. The third border of gold, with studs of silver, which the third Spea∣ker offered to the Spouse, was wrought upon those texts, Gen. 2.15, 16, 17. And the Lord God tooke the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dresse it, and to keepe it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the Garden thou mayest freely eate. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evill, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. And thus he put it on. THis Scripture containeth in it seven particulars: of which by Gods assistance in order.The third Ser∣mon, preached by Dr. Hacket, sometimes fel∣low of new Col∣ledge in Oxon, abridged. 1 Who tooke: The Lord God. 2 Whom: The man Adam. 3 What he did with him: He placed him in Paradise. 4 To what end: To dresse and keepe it. 5 God his large permission to the man: To eat of all other trees. 6 His restraint from the tree of knowledge. 7 His punishment if he refraine it not: Thou shalt die the death. 1. Who tooke.The Lord God, Jehovah, Elohim. In Jehovah note the Unitie, Elohim the Trinitie of persons. Jehovah signifieth that he is of himselfe, and giveth to all other to be: for he is, as Damascene teacheth, the beeing of them that be, the life of all that live. Elohim signifieth which ruleth and disposeth all.
Of this Almighty Maker and Disposer of all, the more wee speake, the more we have to speake; the more we thinke of him, the more wee finde him greater than our thoughts: and therefore with silence admiring that majesty, which neither tongue of men nor Angels can expresse, I passe to the second particular: The Man. Man consisteth of a body and a soule:2. Whom. his body was made of the earth, his soule was inspired by God, not propagated by generation. The soule doth neither beget, nor is begotten, saith Chrysostome, but is infused by God, who is said by the Preacher to give the soule,Eccl. 12.7. The Spirit shall returne to God that gave it: and in this respect is called by the Author of the Epistle to the Hebrewes, TheHeb. 12 9. Father of Spirits. Upon which words St. Jerome in∣ferreth, Ridendi sunt qui putant animas cum corporibus seri: and St. Austine refelleth that opinion by Adams words concerning Eve, This is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh; (he saith not, soule of my soule.) In this part of man, man is said to be made according to Gods own Image, (for theEpiphan. hae∣res. 70. Audi∣ans heresie, which attributed the corporall lineaments of man to God, is long agoe exploded) and that in a threefold respect: 1. In respect of the faculties of the soule; 1. Understanding. 2. Will. 2. In regard of the qualities of the soule; 1. Lightsome knowledge. 2. Perfect holinesse. 3. In regard of the rule that God gave him over all creatures. So St. Ba∣sil expoundeth those words, Let us make man after our image, adding, impe∣riale animal es O homo, quid servis affectibus? to whom Chrysostome, A∣thanasius, Aquinas, and all the Schoole-men assent. And let this suffice to bee spoken of the man: in the third place followeth Put him into the Garden of Eden.3. What he did with him. Of this Garden two questions are dispu∣ted on by Divines: 1. Whether this Garden were a reall place in the earth. 2. Whether Paradise yet remaine. To the first I answer, that questionlesse Paradise was a true and reall Garden, as S. Jerome and Chrysostome affirme against Origen. Origines sic allego∣rizat ut historiae tollit veritatem; non licet nobis ita nugari, & simpliciorum auribus imponere, dicendo nullum fuisse in terris hor tum, quem vocant Pa∣radisum: and Bellarmine proves it sufficiently against the fancy of Franciscus Georgius. To the second I answer, That the place of the earth remaineth in sub∣stance, though it is not now a Paradise, or hortus deliciarum: for the beauty of it is gone. The curse of the whole earth, to beare thornes and thistles, is come upon it. As for the Paradise mentioned in SaintLuk. 23.43. Luke, and in theApoc. 2.7. A∣pocalypse, it was celestiall: and Saint2 Cor. 12.4. Paul maketh it plaine, where having said hee was rapt up into the third heaven, by and by hee nameth the place, Paradise. Upon which words Saint Ambrose thus commenteth, Pa∣radisum intelligit coelestem, de quo Dominus dixit latroni, hodiè mecum
eris in Paradiso. You have heard where the Lord placed him: it remaineth that we enquire in the fourth place 4. To what end God placed him there.To dresse and keepe the garden. God had not yet cursed the earth, neither were the wholsome hearbes degenerated into weeds. Every plant and hearbe brought forth fruit according to their kind, & God that made them good, could have preserved them in that state of goodnesse: but man had need of some im∣ployment, and therefore God injoyned him to dresse this garden of pleasure in this place, to make use of his gifts, and by his reason and industry to modell it into some delightfull forme: yet was his labour without all pain, nay, it was full of pleasure. But why is it added, to keepe it? Surely (saith St. Austine) no in∣vading neighbour was feared to put him out of possession, nor thiefe to rob him of his choicest plants; but God would have him therefore to keepe it to himselfe, ne inde projiciatur. This is wittily inferred by him: but it seemes the naturall meaning of the place is this, that he should not onely dresse it, as at the first, but with continuall care keepe it. God would not have man idle, no not in Paradise. Thus briefly of his dressing and keeping: now we are to consider in the fift place 5. Gods large permission.That he might eat of every tree in the Garden. Behold Gods bounty: there was not onely the delicacy of all fruits, but variety; and Adam was not limited to some few, he might eat of every tree: neither was he for a short time to have enjoyed this, if he had harkened to the command of his Lord. For in the midst grew the tree of life, of which he might eat at his pleasure: the other trees (saith S.Lib. 13. è Ci∣vit. Dei. Austine) were given to him to satisfie his hunger and thirst, but this to give vigour to him, and keep him from infirmity, age, and death: yet this grant was not so generall, but that it had annexed unto it a restraint, which we are to con∣sider of in the sixt place: 6. His restraint.From the tee of knowledge. It was not so called (asAntiq. uda∣. l. 3. c. 9. Josephus dreamed) because it had a vertue in it to sharpen the understanding, that man might know God the better. (For it was as the other trees of the Garden, without sense or knowledge:) but it was intituled so in a double respect: 1. Because joyned to the commandement, it was an outward sign, shewing what was good, viz. what God commanded; and what was evill, viz. what God forbad. 2. In respect of the event. As the waters of Meribah or strife were so called, because Israel there contended: so was this tree called the tree of knowledge of good and evill, because hereby Adam knew experimentally what good there was in obeying, and what evill in disobeying; what good in innocency, and what evill in iniquity; what good within the bounds of Paradise, and what evill in the accursed world. St.Serm. 14. de ver. Dom. Austine thus openeth the matter, Doe not touch this tree. Why? What is this tree? If it be good, why should I not touch it? If it be evill, what maketh it in Paradise? Doubtlesse it was good; why then may be not touch it? That father answereth sweetly, quia obedientem te volo, non contradi∣centem; serve, prius audi domini jussum, & tunc jubentis disce consilium. God, like a good Physician, shewed Adam what was hurtfull; Adam like an in∣temperate patient, would not refraine it. 7. Hi punish∣ment if he re∣straine it not.In the day that thou eatest thou shalt dye. The same day thou forsakest mee in thy disobedience, I will forsake thee in my justice: thou shalt dye, first, the death of the body, and after, the death of the soule, if thou beleeve not in the promised seed: and not thou onely in thy person, but all thy children
stand and fall in thee: they stand in thy obedience, and in thy disobedience they fall: and in the truth of this let all confesse to the glorie of God, Iniquum est ut bene sit desertori boni, it was sinne in Adam to forsake his Maker, it was justice in God to punish him that in this manner had forsaken him. Thus much for the opening of the Text. Let us now apply it to this honoura∣ble assembly. 1 This Garden of Eden may well be compared to our mother the Church. 2 This man, to our spirituall and temporall Rulers. 3 This placing man in Paradise, to their calling, that is, of God. 4 This dressing and keeping it, to their labours in their charge. 5 The eating of every tree, to their reward. 6 Their restraint from the tree of knowledg, to that which is forbidden them. 7 This threatned death, to the punishment of all transgressours. 1 Touching our Church, and her resemblances to Paradise. 1 As Paradise was separated from other parts of the earth, so this Land: the Poet calleth us, Toto divisos orbe Britannos. 2 As Paradise was beautified with the lights of nature: so our Church with gifts of grace above nature. 3 As Paradise was beset with faire trees, that hare pleasant fruits: so our Church with many Pastours, whose lives are faire to behold, and the fruits of their lips sweet to taste. 4 In the midst of Paradise was the tree of life, in our Church Christ crucified: on whom whosoever feedeth by faith shall live for ever. So that what Jacob spake of the place where he was, may be sayd of our Church; This is no o∣ther than the house of God. For albeit there be many plants in this Gar∣den which the Lord hath not planted; many wild branches that need pru∣ning, many dead, not enlived by Christ, many poysonous weeds, many flowers faire in shew, but of a stinking savour; and no marvell: (for in the Arke there was a Cham, in Abrahams house an Ishmael, in Jacobs family a Reu∣ben, in Davids Court an Absalom, in the number of Christs Disciples a Ju¦das, nay, in heaven a Lucifer.) Yet sith our Church striveth to pluck up these weeds, and unsavourie or unfruitfull plants, and desires to be freed of them, it may truely be called the Garden of God. For as St.Ad Felician. Austine saith, The Goats must feed with the sheepe till the chiefe shepheard come. Ille nobis imperavit congregationem, sibi reservavit separationem: ille da∣bit separare qui nescit errare. 2 Touching our Rulers and Governours resemblance to the man. Adam, whom God appointed Ruler over all the creatures, was furnished with gifts a∣greeable. God made greater lights to rule the day and night: so should they be great in wisdome, and great in goodness that are to enlighten others. I am not to flatter you, nor to reprove you: happy is that Church whose Rulers are so qualified. 3 Touching the comparison of Adams placing in Paradise with our calling. 1 I note, that God was not wooed with friendship, nor won with mony, nor swayed with affection, to place Adam in Paradise; but of his own voluntary motion he placed him there. Let us tread in the steps of our heavenly Father. WhenOmph. in vit. Clem. Cle∣ment the fift Bishop of Rome was importuned by his kindred, and offred mo∣ny to conferre a benefice upon an unworthy man, he answered, Nolo obtem∣perare sanguini, sed Deo: let us take on us the like resolution. For what
an uncomely thing is it to set a leaden head upon a golden body? to make fooles rulers of wise men? 2 I note, that Adam did not ambitiously affect this place, nor by indirect means sought to winde himselfe into it; but God tooke him by the hand, and placed him there: but now I feare St. Jeromes speech is true of divers, Presbyte∣ratus humilitate despectâ festinamus episcopatum auro redimere. 3 I note, Adam was not created in Paradise, but by his maker placed in it. Let mee apply this to you the right worshipfull Governours of this Citie: You were not born, but brought by God to this rule and governement; though as clouds you soare aloft, yet were you but vapours drawne from the earth: it is God that hath lifted up your heads, as he raised David from the sheepefold, and Joseph from the dungeon. Wherefore in acknowledgment of your owne unworthinesse, and Gods goodnesse to you, say you withGen. 32.10. Jacob, With my staffe passed I over this Jordan. Say you with David,1 Sam. 18.11. Quis ego sum? aut quae est cognatio mea? Ascribe the glory of your wealth and honour to God, kisse the blessed hand that hath lifted you up, and consider with me in the next place why God placed you here. 4 Touching Adams dressing and keeping Paradise, and your charge. St. Ambrose well observeth, that though Paradise needed no dressing, yet God would have Adam to dresse it, that his example might be a law to his posteri∣tie to dresse and keepe the place of their charges. It is not enough for you to be good men, ye must be good rulers. He that hath an office must attend upon his office: it is opus oneris, as well as opus honoris. Yee must not be like an∣tickes in great buildings, which seeme to beare much, but indeed sustaine no∣thing: neither must ye lay the whole burden upon other mens shoulders, sith the key of governement is layd on yours. Now in dressing the Garden, three duties are especially to be required: 1 To cast and modell the Garden into a comely forme: Of which I need to speake nothing. Your forme of governement may be a president to other Ci∣ties of this kingdome: strangers have written in praise of it. 2 To root up and cast out stinking weeds. Among which I would commend two to your speciall care; 1 Papisme. 2 Puritanisme. I deny not but that it belongeth to the speciall care of our Bishops to plucke up these weeds: yet as Judas sayd to Simon, Helpe thou me in my lot, and I will helpe thee in thine; so ought both Spirituall and Temporall Gover∣nours joyne hands in rooting out these weeds. 1 Of Papisme. In the dayes of Jehosaphat that good King, it is recor∣ded, that the high places were not taken away, because the people did not set their heart to seeke the God of their Fathers. The Papists seeke to their God of Rome theDistinc. 96. Pope, as the Canonists stile him, not to the God of heaven, nor the God of their Fathers. Did their Fore∣fathers in the Primitive Church equall traditions with Scripture? conse∣crate oratories to Saints? pray in an unknown tongue? mutilate the Sacra∣ment? adore the wafer, and call it their maker? did they sell indulgences to
free men from Purgatorie? Saint Peter taught us to bee subject to1 Pet. 2.13. every humane ordinance: St. Paul commandeth everyRom. 13 1. soule to be subject to the higher powers. The Primitive Christians inTert. ad Sp. Ter∣tullians time, though they were cruelly persecuted by the heathen Em∣perours, and had power and strength enough to revenge themselves; yet they never lifted up their hands against any of those bloudy Tyrants. Heare their profession in Tertullian, Nos nec Nigriani, nec Cassiani sumus, we are no Nigrians, no Cassians, no Rebels, no Traitors; we fill all your Cities, Islands, Townes, yea, your Palace and Senate: What were we not able to doe, if it were not more agreeable to our Religion to be killed, than upon any pretence to kill? On the con∣trarie, the Papists teach that it is not onely lawfull, but a meritorious act, to lay hands upon the Lords annointed, if hee favour not their Idolatries and Superstitions; witnesse Cardinall Como his instructi¦ons to Parry, and Sixtus his oration in defence of the Jacobine that murdered Henrie the third. Had the Apostles preached this faith to the world, should they have converted the world? Was this the pra∣ctice of the Primitive Church? Is this Religion to make murder spi∣rituall resolution, to eate their God upon a bargaine of bloud? Can∣not God propagate his truth but by these wicked and damnable meanes? Origen writeth that some unskilfull Emperickes dealt with their Pati∣ents not to consult with learned Physicians, lest by them their igno∣rance should be descried: even so the leaders of Papists deale with them, they will not suffer them to heare our Sermons, or consult with our Divines, not for love to their followers, lest they should be insnared by us; but lest their falshood should be discovered. 2 Of Puritanisme. By Puritans the Preacher professed that hee un∣derstood not those who are usually branded with that name, but a sect of impure Catharists or Donatists, stiled The Brethren of the Separation, who refuse to partake with us in our Prayers and Sacra∣ments, whose God is their fancie, and Religion the dreame of their owne heart; who seeke to build a Babel of confusion among us: but the God of heaven confound their tongues. Was not the Church of Corinth more corrupted in Doctrine and Manners than they pretend ours to be? yet Saint Paul calleth it a Church. Doth not Christ call it his field where there grew many tares? Did not Christ suffer Judas, whom hee knew to bee a Theefe and a Traitour, to partake of the Sacra∣ment with his Disciples? Yet these pure Sectaries will none of our Communion, for that some uncleane persons presume to come thither. To whom wee answer as SaintLib. 3. c. 50. & ep 48. Austine doth to Cresconius, These evills are displeasing to the good; wee forbid and restraine them what wee can, what wee cannot wee suffer: but wee doe not for the tares sake forsake the field, for the chaffe leave the floore of Christ, for the evill fish breake the net, for the Goats sake re∣fuse the fold of Christ. When Religion was partly corrupted, part∣ly contemned in Israel, and the Prophets cryed, Goe out from them, and touch no uncleane thing, did they then sever them∣selves from them? I finde no such thing (saith SaintIn Evang. Serm. 8. Austine)
yet doubtlesse they did themselves what they willed others to doe. Hoc ergo est exire ore non parcere, hoc immundum non tangere, vo∣luntate non consentire: liber in conspectu Dei est, cui nec Deus sua pec∣cata imputat quae non fecit, neque aliena quae non approbavit, ne{que} negli∣gentiam, quia non tacuit, ne{que} superbiam, quia ab unitate Ecclesiae non recessit. 3 To nourish the tender and feeble plants, that is, to shew mercy on them that are in need. When I call to minde your Almes-houses for the poore, your Hospitalls for the maimed, your houses of correction for idle persons; I can∣not but commend your care in this behalfe: this Citie may be a president for all other places: the Garden of Eden never smelt so sweet in the nostrils of Adam, as the remembrance of these your workes of mercy in the nostrils of Almighty God. Nunquam veterascet haec manus.Eccles. 11.1. Cast thy bread upon the waters, and after many dayes thou shalt finde it; but see thou cast the bread thou hast justly gotten: Quicquid enim (saith St. Gregory) ex scelere in Dei sacrificio affertur, non placat Dei iracundiam, sed irritat. Secondly, Cave ne rem pauperum non pauperibus tribuas, & liberalitas liberalitate pereat. Thirdly, give that thou intendest whilest thou livest. For thou knowest not how thy Will will be performed. Heare what St. Ba∣sil saith: When thou shalt have no name among the living, thou saist, I will be liberall: Is not this to say in effect, I would live alwaies, and en∣joy my substance? but if I die then I give: Wee may thanke thy death for thy bounty,2 Cor. 9.7. not thee. Be not deceived, God would have a living (not a dead) sacrifice. Lastly, you must continue in good order the severall pla∣ces of your charge: the cursed earth will still bring forth weeds, wherewith your garden for want of care will be soone over-growne. Remember Saint Pauls cursum consummavi: non cepisse sed perfecisse virtutis est, nec in∣choantibus sed perseverantibus datur proemium. And so I fall upon my fift point. 5 Touching the reward. Yee shall not dresse Paradise in vaine, God will be unto you as unto Abraham, a buckler and exceeding great reward: he will build up your house, and blesse you in all your wayes; yea, he will give you to feed on the tree of life in the midst of the Paradise of God. 6 Touching the prohibition. Sith God is so bountifull to permit you to eat of all other trees, eate not of the tree of knowledge: you shall not be as Gods, though the Divell tell it you, nor gaine heaven by it, but lose Paradise. Naboth's vineyard, Uriah's wife, Achan's golden wedge, Belshazzar's quaffing bowles, Gehazi's bribes were forbidden fruit, sweet in the taste, but death in the stomacke. 7 Touching the punishment. Although corporall death seizeth not forth∣with upon offenders, yet the sentence is passed against them: the life of grace is departed from them, and except by repentance they seeke to have part in the first resurrection, they shall be cast into the lake of fire without redemption. To conclude all, let us that are desirous to walke with God, as our callings re∣quire, seeke to dresse and keepe the garden, our mother Church and Countrey: let us not make our selves like briars to scratch her, or thornes to pricke her, or weeds to annoy her; but as blessed plants let us beare plentifull fruits to com∣fort and nourish her.
Thus this Speaker, as if he had tasted of the tree of life, which, as Josephus writeth, prohibuit senium & mortem; this aged Paul discoursed unto you of the Garden of Eden in a flourishing stile: he, as the former two, presented the Spouse with a precious border, wherein I am now to work his embleme, consisting, as the former, of an Image and a Motto; the Image is Triarius, the Motto the words of Tullie, de claris Oratoribus. Me delectabat Triarii in illa aetate plena literatae senectutis oratio: quanta severitas in vultu? quan∣tum pondus in verbis? quam nihil non consideratum exibat ex ore? I was much taken with the learned oration of Triarius that ancient Oratour: what gravitie was in his countenance? what weight in his speech? how did he pon∣der every word that proceeded out of his mouth? THE FOURTH BORDER: OR, THE SACRIFICE OF RIGHTEOUSNES. The fourth border of gold, with studs of silver, which the fourth Speaker offred to the Spouse, was wrought upon that text, Psal. 4.5. Offer the sa∣crifice of righteousnesse, and put your trust in the Lord. And thus he put it on. Right Honourable, &c. GOd hath made us a feast of many dayes:The fourth Sermon, prea∣ched by master Francis White, now L. Bishop of Ely, and L. Almoner to his Majestie. that we be not unthankfull un∣to him, let us offer him a sacrifice, especially that which is prescribed in the words of my text. Wherein you have a double precept, 1 Of righteousnesse. Wherein observe 1 The act, Offer. 2 The matter, a sacrifice. 2 Of hope and confidence. Wherein observe 1 The act, Trust. 2 The object, in the Lord. 1 Of the act, Offer. To offer is to exhibit and shew forth such workes be∣fore God, as please him, and testifie his power and goodnesse; and we are sayd herein to offer unto him in regard of our intention herein to performe accepta∣ble service unto him, and our desire to glorifie him: not as if God received any things at our hands: for our goodnessePsal. 16: 2. Hier. ad Ce∣lant. reacheth not to him. If thou be righte∣ous it is nothing to him, what receiveth he at thine hand? Obsequio nostro non indiget Deus, sed nos illius indigemus imperio. And albeit the Scrip∣ture
attribute hands to God, yet it is to give, not to receive any thing from us. (O that our Demi-gods, Judges and Magistrates, had but such hands! O that they were like unto Artaxerxes Longimanus, not to take bribes, nor extort, but to reach justice!) What doth theChrys. 2 Cor. hom. 30. Sun receive from the eye which it enlighteneth? or theAug. de civit. Dei l. 10. fountain from the mouth which it refresheth and cooleth? or the anchor from the ship which it foundeth and establisheth? Notwithstanding, though God receive nothing from us, as any accession to his infinite perfection, and his sim∣plicity excludeth any addition thereunto; yet he requireth our sacrifices as his rent and fee, and we are continually to offer them unto him; and that in a three∣fold respect: 1 Of God.Tert. l. 4. cont. Marcion. Cui omne altum inclinat, cui omnes debent , cui omne debemus quod sumus, quod possumus; from whom weJam. 1.17. receive all things. 2 In respect of our own condition, who are Gods workmanship, and therefore ought to be serviceable to him; his field, and therefore ought to beare fruit unto him, his royall Priests, and therefore ought to offer spirituall sacrifices unto him. 3 In respect of the benefit which redoundeth to us by these spirituall sacrifi∣ces. Cast up any thing towards heaven, it falls downe backe againe: even so if we send up the savour of good workes to heaven, it will distill downe againe like sweet waters upon our heads: as on the contrary, the sins of Sodome sent up a steame to heaven, which congealed in the aire, and turned into a storme of sulphur, and rained downe upon their heads. To offer unto God, what is it else than to scatter seed on earth, that we may receive fruit in heaven? to open our laps and bosome, that Gods treasure may fall into it? to lay the sure foundati∣on of a building not made with hands? to stoope and kneele downe before God, that he may put upon us a Crowne of glorie, as Noblemen when they receive a Coronet from the King? Herein note the difference between those things which are offered to God, and those that are offered to the world: those that are offered to God are preserved, and returned backe upon us; but those things that are of∣fered to the world perish themselves, and destroy us; as a talent of lead sinkes it selfe, and drownes him on whom it is cast. Pereat ergo mundi lucrum, ne fi∣at animae damnum. There was never heard of such a bankrupt as the world, which breaketh every weeke, nay, every day, and undoeth thousands: it useth the worldling asSueton. in Vesp. c. 16. Vespasian did his catchpole officers, who, when they had filled themselves with rapines and spoyles, picked some occasions to squieze them like spunges, and crush out all that they had gathered, and draw them drie. 1 Whence we may learne how wise and happy they were, who have beene be∣nefactors to Hospitalls, Colledges, and the like places; who, whilest they lived, offered sacrifices of righteousnesse to God. For their gifts are doubly restored unto them in a name among men; so long as one stone shall lie upon another in these buildings, their praise shall be read: secondly, in an immarcessible crown in heaven. As on the contrary, you may discover their folly, who offered all their wealth and meanes to the world, to pride, to lust, to riot: whose reward is va∣nity whilest they live, rottennesse when they die, shame and confusion when they arise. 2 This may serve to stirre us up to exhibite willingly our offerings to God. Of∣fer of your selves; God loveth a chearefull giver. How chearfully doth the husbandman goe out to sow his seed? yet after he hath sown it, it is subject to ma∣ny casualties. How easily doe fruitfull trees part with their ripe fruit? A full
and frontie eare sheds of himselfe; but on the contrary, a withered and blasted eare, crush it and beat it never so much, it will yeeld nothing but chaffe and dust: a perfect embleme of a greedy griper, a sordid churle; hammer him how you will, straine him, squieze him, thump him, yet you shall get nothing from him but that which is sordid and illiberall, like himselfe. 3 This may serve to reprove those qui non afferunt, sed auferunt, that are so farre from offering unto God, that they take away from him, either his glorie and worship, as the Papists and all Idolaters doe; or his tithes and oblations, as our sacrilegious harpies; of whom we may truly say, Nihil tam sacrum quod non inveniat sacrilegum. But let these Church-robbers remember that they swallow a golden hooke which shalbe raked out of their bellies, as Job speaketh. Some part offerings between God and Mammon, as S. Austin speaketh of Cain, Sua Deo, sibi seipsum dedit. In sum, there is a threefold abuse in things offered to God: 1 Extreme niggardnesse andMal. 1.14. deceit, which God accurseth. 2 Bribery and corruption in ordering & disposing of things offered unto God, in conferring Benefices upon Church-men, or bestowing places in Hospitals; not upon the fittest for such offices and places, but such as by their purse can make best friends. 3 Diversion of things consecrated unto God, to maintaine lust and pride. A lamentable thing that Hospitals erected for the maintenance of the poore, should not be free from oppression: one Bell-wether carrieth away all the wooll and the fat, and rangeth whither he pleaseth, when the poore Bedesman is kept to his mathematicall line, a small pittance God wot, a penny a weeke, or a morsell of bread a day. Thus much of our first observation. 2 The second observation from the act is, that the word in the originall sig∣nifieth mactando offerre, to offer as it were by slaughter; which intimateth that we must use a kind of violence to our selves in the performances of these duties. For we have many lusts and affections in us, as envie, contention, pride, cove∣tousnesse, which are more clamorous than any beggars, and like horse-leaches sucke out all our estate and meanes: besides, we have many worldly occasions; the belly craves, the backe craves, yea, and braves it too, the wife claimes, yea, and exclaimes, children aske, and friends challenge a great part; that even in an ample state little or nothing remaines for God: so that unlesse a man put a sacrificing knife to the throat of his concupiscence, and cut the wind-pipe of his worldly desires, and bind himselfe as it were with cords to the hornes of the Al∣tar, the flesh and the world will devoure all, and nothing will be left for cha∣rity to bestow, but a few scraps cast into the almes-basket. The sacrifices of righteousnesse. In these words I note foure particulars: 1 Rem, Sacrifice. 2 Numerum, Sacrifices. 3 Qualitatem, of righteousnesse. 4 Effectum, and trust in the Lord. Rem, Sacrific. Sacrificium (asLib. 10. de Ci∣vit. Dei, c. 6. Austine defines it) est omne opus bo∣num quod agitur ut sanctâ societate inhaereamus Deo, relatum ad illum fi∣nem boni quo veraciter beati esse possimus. Sacrifices are either, 1 Legall: and these of three sorts, 1 Burnt-offerings. 2 Sinne-offerings. 3 Peace-offerings.
2 Evangelicall: and these may be divided, as the schooles speake, into 1 Sacrificium redemptionis, seu universalis sanctificationis. 2 Sacrificia specialis sanctificationis. For the Legall, they were umbrae futurorum; viz. 1 Of Christs sacrifice. In which respect Nazianzen calleth them ; St.Lib. 2. cont. Faust. Manich. c. 17. Austine termeth them praedicamenta unius veri sacrificii: and St. Cyril saith, Parturiebant veritatem sacrificii. 2 Of the spirituall sacrifice of Christians, that is, holy offices of Religion and charity. So saith St.Lib. 10. de Ci∣vit. Dei, c. 5. Austine, Quaecun{que} in mysterio tabernaculi & de sacri∣ficiis leguntur, ad Dei & proximi dilectionem referuntur: and Justin Martyr, Figurae eorum quae vel praedestinati ad Christum, vel Christus ipse gesturus erat. Now as the shadow vanisheth in the presence of the body, so these after Christs oblation upon the Crosse, Tunc (asLib. 4. cont. Marcion. c. 1. Tertullian speaketh elegantly) compendi∣atum est Novum Testamentum, & legis laciniosis operibus expeditum: As those that cast metals, saithL. de spiritu sanc. Cyril of Alexandria, first make a mold, after the fashion of the bell, vessell, or image which they cast; but after the metall hath run, and the vessell is cast, or the work finished, they lay aside their mold of earth: so after the worke of our redemption was finished, the types and molds of the law were cast away. This Origen after his maner expresseth by an excellent allegory: Til Isaac was born & weaned, Hagar & Ishmael remained in Abrahams house, but afterwards they were turned out of doors: so til Christ the true Isaac was born and weaned, the bondwoman & her son, the Old Testament and types therof, remai∣ned in the Church: but after his birth and ascension they were for ever cashiered. For Evangelicall sacrifices, they are of two sorts: 1 The prime and soveraigne. 2 Subordinate and secundarie. 1 The prime and soveraign is of Christ himselfe, who offered his body for our redemption, and by his bloud entred into the holy place: of which St. Austine ex∣cellently noteth, Unum manebat cum illo cui offerebat, unum se fecit iis pro quibus offerebat, unus ipse erat qui offerebat & offerebatur. 2 Subordinate sacrifice: to this are referred 1 The sacrifice of commemoration, or the commemoration of Christs bloody sacrifice in the Sacrament of our Lords supper,Tert. de pu∣dicit. c. 9. quo opimitate dominici corpo∣ris vescimur, & anima de Deo saginatur, which in this respectIn Psal. 95. Chrysostome calleth coeleste, simul{que} venerandum sacrificium; and Irenaeus, novi testamen∣ti novam oblationem. 2 The workes of charity, which are called1 Pet. 2.5. Heb. 13.16. De idelis. sacrifices; and we must still offer them, if we beleeve Tertullian; Spiritualibus modo hostiis litandum Deo: andCon. Juli. l 10. Cyril, Crasso ministerio relicto mentalis fragrantiâ oblationis. And these we are to offer the rather, because we are eased of the burden of the other. The diffe∣rence between us and those under the law is not in the duty of offering, but in the kind of sacrifice:Iren. l. 4. c. 34. oblationes hic, oblationes illic. Quippe cum jam nona ser∣vis sed a liberis offerantur,Cap. 21. omnes justi sacerdotalem habent ordinem: not to distribute the mysteries of salvation, but to offer spirituall sacrifices to God. 2 Numerum, Sacrifices in the plurall number: plurall in specie and in indi∣viduo. For we are to offer divers kinds of sacrifices, and we are often to offer them. There are ordinary sacrifices and extraordinary, morning and evening; sacrifices of the soule, and sacrifices of the body; internall and externall; where∣unto
St.Lib. de spirit. sanct. Cyril applyeth that description of Solomons Queene, Psal. 45. All glorious within, in inward devotion, & in a vesture embroidered with gold, in respect of her outward oblations. It is not enough to offer to God inward sacrifices, we must offer also outward. First, because God requireth them. Se∣condly, because we receive from him outward blessings. Thirdly, because we sin in outward things, and therefore ought to seek toQuo sensu opera placant Dei iram. Vid. in fra. pacifie and appease his wrath by our outward sacrifices. Of these there are divers kinds: I will note three. 1. Of almes and charitable deeds, whereunto the1. Tim. 6. Heb. 13. Apostle exhorteth:1. Cor. 13. Of these three the greatest is charity: haec est Regina virtutum, saith S. Chry∣sostome; it is as the purple robe which in ancient time was proper to Princes. If thou seest this purple robe of charity upon any, say certainly he is the child of God, he is an heire of the kingdome of heaven. 2. Of mortification, whereunto theRom. 12.1. Apostle exhorteth. Hereby we expresse the1. Cor. 9.27. 2. Cor. 4.8. dying of the Lord Jesu in our bodies; 1. By temperance in our diet, which is not more salubrious to the body, than healthfull to the soule. 2. By fasting, which without doubt is an act tending to religion, and helping it. For so wee read,Luke 2.37. Anna served God with fasting and prayer: and Christ promiseth aMat. 6.13. reward unto it; and the Fathers generally make fasting and almes-deeds the two wings, carrying our prayers to heaven. 3. By Christian modesty in apparell, habit and deportment: cura corporis, in∣curia animae. The pride and luxury of this age in this kind exhausteth mens estates, and eats up all their holy oblations. What shall I speake of our pla∣stered faced Jezebels, who are worse than those Idols which we have cast out of our Churches? Those are but dead Idols, these are living, and rank them∣selves with our gravest Matrons: all bounds of modesty are broken, and markes of honesty confounded. 3. Of obedience, whereunto theHeb. 13. Apostle exhorteth. If obedience bee better than sacrifice, the sacrifice of obedience must needs be the best sacrifice. Yet so hath the Divell blinded many, that they place the greatest Religion in disobedi∣ence. God accepted not Corah his sacrifice, because he sacrificed in schisme: nor will hee of their outward religious acts, who stand in opposition to the Churches authority. Government is as necessary in the Church as in the Commonwealth. 3. Qualitatem sacrificiorum, sacrifices of righteousnesse, that is, sacrifices rightly offered. Chrysostome sheweth the maner; the sanctified will (saith he) is the altar, charity the fire, the sword of the Spirit the knife, the hand faith. 4. Effectum, the effect of these sacrifices. As good works partake in the name, so have they the effect and vertue of sacrifices. In a good construction they may be said to appease Gods wrath, and to procure unto us spirituall and temporall blessings: they may be said to appease Gods wrath three wayes; 1. By taking away the fuell thereof, viz. sins. For as light expelleth darkness, so the sacrifice of righteousnesse expelleth impiety and iniquity, which provoke Gods wrath. 2. By brightning the Image of God in us, and making it more conspicuous: this  enflame Gods love to us in his beloved Christ Jesus. Certainly as  aments & jewels make a Spouse more amiable in the eies of her hus∣  good works, when their imperfections are covered with the robes of  righteousnes, make the soule more amiable in the sight of God and men.
3. By making us capable of a greater measure of Gods love and favour. For though they are no way meritorious causes of Gods blessings spirituall or tem∣porall, yet are they as precious dispositions and conditions in the subject: and as these appease Gods wrath, so they may bee said to impetrate of God spirituall and temporall blessings. In this argument this grave and learned Divine expatiated, alledging ma∣ny remarkable passages out of the ancient Fathers: namely, out of Saint Chrysostome, in Heb. hom. 33. Talibus sacrificiis placatur Deus: S. Ambrose de penit. l. 2. c. 4. Qui agit poenitentiam non solum diluere lachrymis debet pec∣catum suum, sed etiam emendatioribus factis operire, & tegere delicta superi∣ora, ut non ei imputetur peccatum: Gelas. cont. Pelag. concil. Tom. 2. Tam ju∣gi supplicatione, quam eleemosynis, caeterisque bonis actionibus expiandum est peccatum: August. ep. 54. Misericordiae operibus expiatur peccatum: Ful∣gent. ep. 2. Agnoscamus opera bona locum orationis habere apud Deum: Hilar. in Matth. can. 4. Charitas errorum nostrorum ad Deum ambitiosa est patro∣na: Tertull. de patient. c. 13. Mortificatio aures Christi aperit, severitatem dispergit, clementiam illicit: Greg. moral. 9. c. 14. Verba nostra ad Deum sunt opera quae exhibemus: Et in Psal. 7. poenit. Quid est manibus Deum ex∣quirere, nisi sanctis operibus invocare Salvatorem? Cyp. ep. 8. Admoneo re∣ligiosam solicitudinem vestram ut ad placandum atque exorandum Domi∣num, non voce solâ, sed & jejuniis & lachrymis, & omni genere deprecationis ingemiscamus: Chrysost. 2. Cor. hom. 20. Spiritum vocas non verbis, sed fa∣ctis opus clamat, & fit sacrificium. And now that I have set before you the gift of the fourth Speaker, viz. a border of gold with studs of silver; it remaineth that I work in it, as in the three former, his embleme, consisting of an Image and a Motto: the Image is Cotta, the Motto the words of Cicero, de claris Oratoribus: Inve∣niebat acutè Cotta, dicebat purè, nihil erat in ejus oratione nisi siccum & sanum. Cotta his invention was a∣cute, his elocution was pure, and there was nothing in his Sermon which was not solid and sound.
THE REHEARSERS CONCLUSION, OR THE FASTENING THE BORDERS TO THE SPOUSE HER NECKE AND BREAST. PLinyPlin. l. 2. nat. hist. c. 44. Me∣tellae Crassi uxoris sepul∣chrum ita con∣structum est, ut quinquies can∣dem verborum sententiam re∣gerat. writeth of an Eccho sounding from the Tombe of Metella,Conclusion. which repeated the same sentence five severall times: this five-fold Eccho I am now become in your eares, eandem sententiam quinquies regerens, rehearsing now my Text five times, foure in repetition and appli∣cation to the foure Preachers, and now the fifth time in the conclusion and application to my selfe. Vary the translation as you please, yet the colla∣tion will still hold; if you stand to the last, and reade the words, wee will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver, the collation is already made: for the foure borders are the foure methodicall discourses, beautified with variety of art and learning, which I have imperfectly rendered; and nothing remaineth, but that (as it were) with a silke string or ribbon I gather the rowes of pearle, and all the borders of gold together (which before I tooke off, that we might more particularly view them) and fasten them all to the Spouse her neck & breast by drawing towards an end, and pressing close my exhortation to the heart of this great assembly. If you follow learned Juni∣us his translation, Faciemus tibi aureas lineas cum punctis argenteis, you may be pleased to interpret the foure lines of gold drawne at length, to bee the foure Texts handled and unfolded at large by the Preachers: and the puncta argentea, or the points of silver, speciall notes of observation upon them, placed as points or prickes in a line, some in the beginning, some in the mid∣dle, and some in the end. The points beginning and continuing wee have already passed, and are now come to puncta terminantia, the closing points; or rather period and full poin of all. But if you preferre the Seventies tran∣slation before either, and will have the Text rendred thus, Faciemus tibi similitudines auri cum punctis argenteis, Wee will make thee similitudes or re∣semblances of gold with points of silver; my application shall bee in the words of Origen, Nos tibi aurea ornamenta facere non possumus, non tam divites sumus ut Sponsus, qui aureum tibi monile largietur; nos similitudines auri faciemus. And indeed what are the imperfect notes which I have im∣parted to you, but similitudines, obscure resemblances of those borders of gold I spake but now of? In which respect, as when Marcellus in his Page∣ant brought in golden Statues or Images of the Cities hee had taken, and
afterwards Fabius brought in the same carved in wood; Chrysippus said wit∣tily, Has illarum thecas esse; so it may bee truly said, that the Sermons which I have repeated were but illorum thecae, covers, or at the best tables and indexes of theirs: the blame whereof lyeth not wholly upon the bro∣ken vessell of my memory, or my noters: for though the vessell be sound, and set direct under the spouts mouth, it is not possible▪ but that some drops should fall besides, and others be blowne away with the winde. The heavenly doctrine of the Preachers powred downe in great abundance like great showers of raine from heaven, they themselves were as golden spouts, at whose mouth though I set my pitchers as close and steady as I could, yet many silver drops went besides them; notwithstanding you see they are full and runne over. Take you yet another similitude, that you may have simi∣litudines, according to the letter of my Text, as the Seventy reade it. The foure Sermons were like foure Garlands crowning the Spouse of Christ, out of which I have culled some of the chiefest flowers; and howsoever in the plucking of them and sorting them many leaves are shattered, and some flowers lost, yet there are more left than can bee contained within the hand∣full of the time allotted. Wherefore now I will leave gathering, and fall to making up my Posie, winding up all the flowers orationis meae filo, with the remainder of the thrid of my discourse upon the Text. We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. As out of the bran∣ches of trees there shoot first buds, then blossomes, and last of all fruit; so out of Texts of Scripture, which are  branches of the tree of life, issueth first the literall sense, which because it groweth immediatly out of the barke and stocke of the letter, resembleth the  bud: and then the spirituall, which because it is most pleasant and beautifull to the eye of the soule, may bee likened to the  blossome: and thirdly the morall sense, which because it is most fruitfull, and immediatly profitable for our instruction, may be termed the fruit. To illustrate this by the words of my Text, or rather the words of my Text by it. The literall sense is of Solomon his Queen, richly decked; the spirituall is of Christ his Church, rarely furnished; the morall is of sa∣cred vowes religiously to be performed. You see 1 The bud of the literall, 2 The blossome of the spirituall, 3 The fruit of the morall sense. But herein you are to observe a remarkable difference between the tree of life and other trees: for their buds are but a degree to the blossomes, and the blossomes to their fruit, neither bud nor blossome beare fruit; but in the tree of life both the bud, which I compared to the literall, and the blos∣some, which I called the spirituall, and the fruit, which I termed the morall, beare severall and distinct fruits. For instance, the bud yeelds this fruit, That it is lawfull for noble and honourable women, especially Kings wives & daugh∣ters, to weare rich attire and costly ornaments. The blossome yeelds this fruit, That as Gods goodnesse hath abounded to the Church under the Gospel, so all Christians ought to abound in love and thankfulnesse to him. Lastly, the morall sense, which I termed the fruit, yeeldeth over and above this fruit,
That what the friends of the Spouse here promise, all godly pastors and people ought to performe, that is, these out of the riches of their learning, they out of their worldly wealth ought to adorne and beautifie the Church, and in diffe∣rent kindes make for the Spouse of Christ borders of gold with studs of silver. To gather first the fruit of the bud, or literall sense. If costly apparrell and precious attire were an abomination to the Lord; if cloth of gold and silver, and borders of pearle and precious stones were as great a deformity to the minde as they are an ornament to the body, the Scripture would not set outGen. 24.22. Rebecca in bracelets and abiliments of gold, norEzek. 6.11, 12. Ezekiel in the person of God upbraid the Synagogue as he doth: I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thine hands, and a chaine on thy necke, and I put a jewell on thy fore-head, and eare-rings in thine eares,Ver 13. and a beautifull crowne upon thy head; thus wast thou decked with gold and silver, and thy raiment was of fine linnen and silke: nor Solomon described hisPsal. 45.9. Queene in a vesture of gold of Ophir: neither the ProphetEsay 61.10. Esay have compared the Spouse of Christ clothed with the garments of salvation, and covered with the robes of righteousnesse, to a Bride adorned with jewells. And therefore howsoever Saint1 Tim. 2.9. Paul, and Saint1 Pet. 3.3. Peter forbid women to aray themselves with gold, or pearles, or costly aray: and SaintDe habitu Virg. Cyprian is yet severer against costly apparrell, saying, Nullarum ferè pretiosior cultus est, quàm quarum pudor vilis est: and, Serico & purpurâ indutae Christum induere non possunt, auro & margaritis, & monilibus ornatae ornamenta pectoris perdiderunt (which I spare to English in favour of that sexe): yet, as I conceive, the holy A∣postles & the devout Father in these & the like wholsome and necessary ad∣monitions, condemne not simply Gods servants for the use, but rather pro∣phane persons for the abuse of these beautifull creatures of God; they seek to abase the pride of the heart, not abate the price of these merchandizes. They taxe, and that most justly, three vices too common in these luxuri∣ous times, 1 Vanity in the garish forme of apparrell. 2 Excesse in the costly matter or stuffe. 3 Indecency and immodesty in both, or either. Or they speake comparatively, that women should not so much desire toAntiph. Po∣et. . adorne their out-side with resplendent pearles, as their inward parts with jewells of vertue and grace. We have gathered the fruit of the bud: come we now to the blossome, that is, the beautifull allegory or spirituall sense; which containeth in it a gracious promise made to the Church, either of larger bounds and limits, likened to the borders of gold, or of a greater measure of knowledge in holy Scriptures, quae sensibus aureae sunt eloquii nitore argenteae,Rupertus, Isi∣dorus, and Gre∣gorius. or abundance of the gifts of the spirit, which no otherwise adorne the Church with their variety, than a golden chaine or border wrought about with studs or specks of silver. Now if God hath made good these his promises to us, shall we make frustrate our holy vowes to him? the better he hath been to us, the worse shall we prove to him? hath hee made more of us than any Nation upon the earth, and shall we make lesse of him? No, the more we have re∣ceived at his hands, the more let us lift up our hearts and hands unto him, or
else for our unthankfulnesse hee will take the chaines and borders of gold from our Church, and put them on some other, that will more thankfully accept them. O let us resemble these resemblances in my Text, the bor∣ders of gold with studs of silver, which, as they receive lustre from the Sunne-beames, so they gild them, and reflect them backe with clearer light, and greater heat. Sacriledge hath already picked out, and plucked a∣way many Oe's and Spangles of silver from our Church, Heresie begins to corrupt her gold, God grant for our ungratitude and security in time we lose not both. I will close up your stomacke, and my discourse, with the fruits of the morall sense of this Text. For the tree of life herein resembleth the Per∣sian Pomecitrine, which (as Theophrastus and Pliny write) Simul frondescit, florescit, & fructificat; at the same time hath buds, blossomes, and fruits on it: and which is more strange in this than in that, each of these beare their severall fruits. You have tasted the fruits of the bud or literall sense, and of the blossome and spirituall; let us now plucke the fruits of the mo∣rall. Wee. Who speak here? The three persons, say three of our prime late Di∣vines, Junius, Mercer and Whitaker: nay rather, saith Rosetus out of Ori∣gen and Jerome, the friends of the Bride, or her companions. For this Song is a kind of divine Pastorall, or Marriage play, consisting of divers acts and scenes; or a sacred Dialogue with many interlocutory passages. First, the Bride comes in and saith, Let him kisse mee with the kisses of his lips: then the Bridegroome, I have compared thee, O my love, to a troupe of horses in Pharaoh's chariots; thy cheekes are comely with rowes of stones, and thy necke with chaines. After which words he withdraweth himselfe, and sitteth at his repast, Ver. 12. and leaveth the Bride with her companions, as it were alone on the Stage; who thus speake to her, Wee will make thee, &c. The words in the originall being indifferent to either Interpretation, I will rather be an Electicke, than a Criticke, chuse out of both, than censure ei∣ther. Admitting then the friends of the Bride to parley with her, what say they? We will. Which we? we of the Clergy, or you of the Laity? We of the Clergy, saith Aquinas, Rupertus,Sanct. in bunc loc. Nam in murenulis Scriptura sacra ostenditur, quae auro spiri∣tualium sen∣suum fulget in∣teriùs, & ar∣gento coelestis eloquii nitet exterius. Sanctius, and Isidorus Hispalen∣sis. For by the borders of gold are meant the holy Scriptures, which shine in∣wardly with the gold of spirituall senses, and outwardly with the silver of hea∣venly elocution. Nay, rather yee of the Laity, will others say: for we of the Clergy may say truly with Peter, Aurum & argentum non habemus, wee have no gold to make borders of, nor silver to make studs of. If it be law∣full for mee to interpose my sentence, I would say questionlesse both: for both are retainers to this Queene, both are friends and servants of this Spouse, bothy owe homage unto her, both must offer unto her gold, silver, and precious stones: we out of the treasury of our knowledge, you of your wealth and substance. Our borders of gold are methodicall and elaborate Sermons and Treatises; yours are charitable deeds: wee make the Spouse borders of gold by sacred collections out of Scripture; you by liberall col∣lections, according to Scripture: we by setting forth learned works tending to devotion; you by shewing forth noble works of bounty & magnificency, proceeding from devotion, first of our workes, and then of yours.
1 First, I observe it is said we will make thee borders, in the plurall num∣ber, not a border of gold, with studs of silver, in the singular. It is not sufficient to make the Spouse one border, be it never so rich; we must make her many borders. Christ his threefold pasce injoyneth at least a double diligence in preaching:John 21.15, 16, 17. Syn. sect. c. 19. , &c. pasce after pasce teacheth us that we must draw line upon line, urge precept upon precept, lay linke upon linke, and joyne pearle to pearle, to make the Spouse a border. Peradventure you will say better one excellent Sermon than many meane and ordinary, Nardi parvus onyx eliciet vini cadum: one border of true pearle is more worth than a thousand of glasse or sophisticate stones; one picture drawne with true and rich colours stands in more than many slubbered over with sleight wash colours. I grant it; and it were to be wished that they who preach seldomer did it alwayes more accurately, that the defect in the number might be supplied in the weight of their Sermons: but certainely experience shew∣eth, that the water corrupteth in the conduits, that are so stopt that they either runne not at all, or but sparingly: and that the golden spouts which adorne the Temple, and run more frequently and fully, yeeld the sweetest and most wholesome water: and St.Basil. ep. . Basil observes the like of Wells, that they grow the better the more water is drawne out of them. Howsoever, considering the dulnesse of hearing, and meane capacity of the ordinary hearer, and brittlenesse of memorie in all, I wish those that are of most e∣minent gifts to dispense the mysteries of salvation more frequently than they usually doe, under pretence of more accurate preparation: because it is most true whichEras. Apoph. in Catone. Cato said in his defence for distributing pieces of silver amongst his souldiers, whereas other Captaines bestowed gold on them: Melius est ut plures argentum quam pauci aurum referant, it is better that many should beare away silver than a few onely gold; or to clothe my al∣legorie with the words of my text, that many, if not all, receive from them studs of silver, than a few, or perhaps some one, a border of gold. 2 Secondly, I observe that it is here said borders of gold: the matter of the borders or chaines must be gold, the matter of our Sermons must be the pure word of God, which is compared in Scripture to the purest1 Pet. 4.11. gold. If any man speake (saith St. Peter) let him speake as the Oracles of God: not Popish legends, not scholasticall subtleties, not morall essayes, no nor sen∣tences of holy Fathers, as the ground-worke of their building; but as but∣tresses or ornaments onely. For asIn Mat. hom. 21. Origen rightly inferreth, Sicut om∣ne aurum quod fuit extra templum non est sanctificatum, ita omnis sensus qui reperitur extra divinam Scripturam, etsi admirabilis, non est sanctus; as no gold without the Temple was sanctified, so no sense or sentence is ho∣ly, though it seeme never so admirable, if it bee without the Scripture, that is, neither expressed therein, nor deduced by good consequence from thence. 3 Thirdly, I observe that it is said borders of gold, with studs of silver: this gold must be wrought into borders, our observations and meditations upon Scripture must be digested into order; and they may be illustrated also with varietie of humane learning, and choyce observations and senten∣ces of other eminent writers, as it were studs of silver: such as we finde not onely in St. Jeromes epistles, and St. Austines bookes of the Citie of
God, and Eusebius his tractates De praeparatione, & demonstratione Evange∣lii, and Clemens Alexandrinus his Stromata; but also in the divinely inspi∣red writings of St. Paul. 4 Fourthly, I observe that it is said borders of gold, with studs or spangs of silver, not borders of gold and silver, much lesse borders of silver, with studs of gold: the borders of gold were not made to set out the studs of sil∣ver, but contrariwise, the studs of silver to beautifie and illustrate the bor∣ders of gold. We must not apply divinity to art, but art to divinity, lest we deservedly incurre the censure of St.Basil. ep 62. . Basil upon some preachers in his dayes, They preach art and wit, and not Christ crucified. We must not make our Scripture texts serve to vent our secular learning, but contrari∣wise, modestly, and moderately use secular learning to explicate andSanctius in hunc locum. Concionatores ars talis esse debet, ut auri nitorem non obscuret sed accendat, quod in monili prae∣stant argentei vermiculi. illu∣strate texts of Scripture: sentences of Fathers, and other Authors, may be scattered in Sermons, as spangs of silver about the Spouse her border, the border must not be made of them. A faireQuintil. inst. orat. Ut affert lumen clavus purpurae loco insertus, ita certè neminem deceat intexta pluribus notis vestis. jewell in the hat, or pendants at the eare, or a chaine of gold or strings of pearle about the necke, become the parts well: but to bee all hung about with foure hundred distinct jewels as Lollia Paulina was, and not onely to bore the eares with rings, but also to dig holes in the cheekes, chinne and lips, and there sticke pretious stones after the manner of theBertius Geo∣graph. Peruvians, were vaine folly, if not madnesse. I have done with our taske, I come now to yours. Although it properly appertaines to our skilfull Bezaleels and Aholiabs to make borders and chaines for the Spouse, yet you are to contribute at least to the making of them: it is your duty to bring into her wardrobe jewels of gold, and jewels of silver, and jewels of raiment. It is not enough to love God with your strength, you must honour him also with your sub∣stance. It is not onely required that you communicate with your Pastors in the Word and Sacraments, but also that you communicate to him that tea∣chethGal. 6.6. in all good things: you have not well acquitted you of your devotion when you have given Christ your eares, you must farther give eare-rings to his Spouse: it will not excuse you to write Christ his words in the palmes of your hands, if you make not bracelets for her armes: you have not done all when you have bowed your necke to his yoake, you must far∣ther decke her necke with chaines: there is something more required of you than to put on the Lord Jesus, you must cloathe his Queene in a vesture of gold. Where can you better bestow your wealth than upon the Church which receiveth of you glasse, but returneth you pearle; receiveth from you carnall things, returneth to you spirituall; receiveth from you com∣mon bread, returneth to you sacramentall; receiveth from you covers of shame, returneth to you robes of glorie: in a word, receiveth from you earthly trash, returneth to you heavenly treasure? When God commanded the people to bringExod. 35.5. offerings to the Lord, they brought them in so freely, that there needed a Proclamation to restraine their bounty. And Livie repor∣teth of the Romans, that when the Tribunes complained that they wanted gold in the treasurie to offer to Apollo, the Matrons of Rome plucked off their bracelets, chaines and rings, and gave them unto the Priests to sup∣ply that defect. And who knoweth not that our Forefathers in the dayes of ignorance placed all Religion in a manner in building religious Houses, and
setting them forth most gorgeously? O let not the Jewes exceed us Chri∣stians, let not Heresie, Idolatry and Superstition out-strip true Religion in sacred bounty. If their devotion needed bridles, let not ours need spurres: If they built Temples upon the ruines of private families, let not us build private houses upon the ruine of Temples: If they turned the Instruments of luxury into ornaments of piety, let not us turne ornaments of piety into instruments of luxury. As nothing is better given than to God, so nothing is worse taken than from his Church. Will God, thinke you, enrich them, who spoyle him? will he build their houses, who pull downe his? will he increase their store, who robbe his wardrobe? will hee clothe them with his long white robe, who strip his Spouse of her attire and comely orna∣ments? Nay rather, as Aeneas, though before he had purposed with him∣selfe to spare the life of Turnus, yet when hee espyed Pallas girdle about him, EtVirg. Aenid. notis fulserunt cingula bullis. he changed his minde, and turned the point of his sword to his heart, say∣ing, Tun' hinc spoliis indute meorum eripiêre mihi? so our blessed Redeemer, when hee seeth his Priests garments upon sacrile∣gious persons, and the chaines and borders of his dearest Spouse upon their minions neckes, will say, Tun' hinc spoliis indute meorum eripiêre mihi? shalt thou escape judgement, who hast robb'd mee thy Judge? shall I spare thee, whom I finde with mine owne goods about thee? shalt thou get out of my hands, who quaffest like Belshazzar in the bowles of my Sanctuary, and bravest it in my Spouse attire? Now, as the speciall operations of the soule reflect upon themselves; and, as definition defines, and division divides, and order digesteth, so also repe∣tition may and ought to repeat it selfe. For the close of all then I will reca∣pitulate my recapitulation, and rehearse my selfe, as I have done the foure Preachers. Of this parcell of Scripture, Faciemus, &c. I have made a threefold ex∣plication, and likewise a threefold application; the first explication was of the rich attire of Solomons Queene; the second of the glorious types of the Jewish Church under the Law; the third of the rich endowments, large borders, and flourishing estate of the Church under the Gospel. My appli∣cation was first to the Clergy; secondly, to the Laity; thirdly, to this present exercise. The friends that here promise to adorne the Spouse with rich bor∣ders, I compared to the foure Preachers, their Sermons to the foure bor∣ders, both in respect of the matter and the forme: their matter was Scrip∣ture doctrine, like pure gold; their forme exquisite art beautifying their Scripture doctrine with variety of humane learning, and sentences of the ancient Fathers, like spangles or studs of silver. In the borders of Solomons
Queene, there was the representation of a Dove, whence they are called Torim, whichBrightman in Cant. some translate Turtures aureas; and their preaching was not in the inticing words of mans wisedome, but in the evidence of the spirit, which descended in the likenesse of a Dove. The borders were joyned to∣gether, and in their Sermons there was good coherence: for whereas there are two parts of Divinity, 1. The first de Dei beneficiis erga homines. 2. The second de officiis hominis erga Deum. The former were handled in the two former Sermons, and the later in the two later. The benefits of God are either 1. Spirituall, as Redemption, of which the first dis∣coursed. 2. Or Temporall, as the wealth of the world, of which the second. The duties of man to God are either 1. Proper to certaine men in regard of their speciall place or calling, as Magistrates or Ministers, of which the third. 2. Common to all Christians, as to offer sacrifices of righteousnesse to God, of which the fourth. The first, as a Herald, proclaimed hostility, Awake, O sword, &c. The second, as a Steward of a Court, gave the charge, Charge the rich, &c. The third, as a Judge, pronounced a dreadfull sentence, In the day thou eatest thou shalt dye the death. The fourth, as a Prophet, gave holy counsell and heavenly advice, Of∣fer, &c. That we may be free from, and out of the danger of the blow of the first, and the charge of the second, and sentence of the third, wee must follow the advice of the fourth. All foure may bee likened to foure buil∣ders, The first fitted and laid the corner stone. The second built a house, whose foundation was laid in humility, Charge the rich that they be not high minded: The walls raised up in hope, to lay hold on eternall life: The roofe was covered with charity, that they bee rich in good workes. The third beautified it with a garden of pleasure, and hee fenced it with the Discipline of the Church, as it were with a strong wall. The fourth built an Altar to offer sacrifice. The first made according to the last Translation borders of gold: his spe∣ciall grace was in the order and composition. The second, according to Junius his version, Lineas aureas, golden lines: his grace was in frequent sentences and golden lines. The third, according to the Seventies interpretation, made Similitudines aureas, golden similitudes, comparing our Church to Paradise.
The fourth (as Brightman rendreth the words) made turtures aureas, gol¦den turtles, gilding over, if I may so speak, our spirituall offrings with a ric discourse of his owne. PlinyLib. 37. nat. hist c. 2 In O∣pale est Car∣bunculi tenui∣r ignis Ame∣hysti fulgens purpura & Smaragdi vi∣rens mre, &c. writeth of the Opall stone, that it represen¦ted the colours of divers precious stones; by name the Ruby or Carbun∣cle, the Amethyst, the Emrald, and the Margarite or Pearle. In like manner I have represented unto you in this Rehearsall the beautifull colours of di∣vers precious stones: in the first the colour of the Ruby; for he discoursed of the bloudy passion of Christ. In the second the purple colour of the Ame∣thyst; for hee treated of riches and purple robes, and the equipage of ho∣nour. In the third the green colour of the Emrald; for hee described the green and flourishing garden of Eden. In the fourth, the cleare or white co∣lour of the Chrystall or Pearle; for hee illustrated unto us the sacrifices of righteousnesse, which are called white, in opposition to the red and bloudy sacrifices of the Law. The Opall representeth the colours of the above∣named precious stones, incredibili mysturâ lucentes, shining by an incredible misture: a glimpse whereof you may have in this briefe concatenation of them all. God hath given us his Sonne the man, that is, his fellow, to be sacrificed for us, as the first taught; and with him hath given us all things richly to enjoy, as the second shwed: not only all things for necessity and profit, but even for lawfull delight and contentment, placing us as it were in Paradise, as the third declared. Let us therefore offer unto him the sa∣crifice of righteousnesse, as the fourth exhorted. Yee whom God hath enriched with store of learning, open your treasures, and say to the Spouse of Christ, out of these we will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. Yee of Gods people, whom hee hath blessed with worldly wealth, open your treasures, and say to the Spouse of Christ, out of these wee will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver: and then bee yee assured, God will open the treasures of his bounty, and the three persons in Trinity will say, We will make you borders of gold with studs of silver; and not onely borders for your breasts, and chaines for your neckes, but also eare-rings for your eares, and bracelets for your hands, and frontlets for your faces, and a crown for your heads: wee will enrich you with invaluable jewels of grace here, and an incorruptible crowne of glory hereafter. So be it heavenly Father, for the merits of thy Sonne, by the powerfull operation of the Holy Spirit. To whom, &c.
THE ANGEL OF THYATIRA ENDITED. A Sermon preached at the Crosse, Anno 1614. THE XXXIII. SERMON. REVEL. 2.18, 19, 20. And to the Angel of the Church in Thyatira, write, These things, saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brasse: 19. I know thy workes, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy workes, and the last to be more than the first. 20. Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth her selfe a Prophetesse, to teach and se∣duce my servants to commit fornication, and to eate things sacrificed unto Idols. Right Honourable, &c. Apoc. 1.12.IF the seven golden Candlestickes which Saint John saw, were illustrious types and glorious emblemes of all succeeding Christian Churches, as many learned Commentatours upon this mysterious prophesie con∣ceive, and the seven Letters written to the seven Chur∣ches of Asia immediatly represented by them, as well appertaine to us in the autumne, for whom, as to those prime-roses that appeared in the spring of Christian piety and religion, to whom they were directed: wee may without scruple seize on this indorsed to the Angel of the Church of Thyatira, breake open the seales, and peruse the contents thereof, which seem better to sort with the present state of our Church, than of any that at this day beares the name of Christian.
Wherefore I make bold to unfold it, and altering a word only in the super∣scription, thus I reade and expound it in your eares, and pray God to seale it up in your hearts. To the Angel that is Guardian, Centinell, or chiefe Watchman of the Church of England, thus writeth the Sonne of God by eternall generation, who hath eyes like a flame of fire to enlighten the darkest corners of the heart, and discover the most hidden thoughts: and his feet like fine brasse, most pure, that can tread upon none but holy ground. I know thy workes to be many, and thy love to be entire, and thy service to be faithfull, and thy faith to be sound, and thy patience to bee invinci∣ble, and thy workes, and the last to be more than the first. The faire and mag∣nificent Colledges lately founded, and Churches sumptuously repaired, and Libraries rarely furnished, and Schooles richly endowed, and Stu∣dents in the Universities liberally maintained, and the poore in Hospitals charitably relieved, are standing testimonies and living evidences thereof: Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, that thou sufferest the woman that sitteth upon seven hils, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth, Jezabel of Rome, which calleth her selfe a Prophetesse, and Mi∣stresse of all Prophets and Prophetesses, by Priests and Jesuites to teach and deceive my servants, to make them commit spirituall fornication, and freely communicate with Idolaters; and I gave her space to repent, sixty yeers at least, that she might not complain that I began with violent & ex∣treme courses, and launced her wounds whilest they were greene; but all this while she hath not repented of her Superstitions and abominable Idola∣tries: therefore I will lay it heavie upon her, I will send plague after plague, and heape sorrow upon sorrow, and adde affliction to affliction; and if all will not serve, I will poure out the dregges of my red wine on her, and quench the fire of my wrath with her stained bloud. I will kill her children with death, and all the Churches shall know that I am hee that searcheth deep into the wounds of the heart and reines, and discover filthi∣nesse & corruption in the inward parts; and I will give unto every one accor∣ding to his workes; but unto you I say, and to the rest in great Britaine, as many as have not this doctrine of the Romish Jezabel, and which have not knowne the depths of Sathan her mysteries of iniquity, I will put upon you no other burden of Lawes or Canons but that which you have already: Hold fast till I come to judgement. In this Letter observe we 1. The superscription mysterious, Ver. 18. 2. The contents various, presenting to our religious thoughts 1. A sweet insinuation, Ver. 19. 2. A sharpe reprehension, Ver. 20, 21. 3. A fearfull commination, Ver. 22, 23. 4. A comfortable conclusion, Ver. 24.
In the superscription wee have an admirable description of the glorified body of our Redeemer, which shineth more brightly than a flame of fire, or the finest metall glowing in the furnace: Secondly, an eminent title attri∣buted to the Bishop or Super-intendent of the Church in Thyatira: The Angel. To the Angel in Thyatira, saith the Sonne of God, who hath eyes like a flame of fire, toBullengerus in hunc locum. Illuminat ali∣os, alios igne sempiterno concremat. inlighten the godly, and burne up the ungodly: and feet like brasse, to support his Church, and bruise the enemies thereof, I know thy workes, proceeding from thy love, and thy love testified by thy service, and thy service approved by thy faith, and thy faith tryed by thy patience; and that the silver springs of thy bounty have more overflowed at the last, than at the first. Thus farre the sweet insinuation, which afterwards falls into a sharpe reprehension, like as the sweet riverSolinus c. 20. Hypanis Scy∣thicorum am∣nium princeps haustu saluber∣rimus, dum in Exampeum fontem infe∣ratur, qui am∣nem suo vitio vertit. Hypanis into the bitter fountaine Exampeus. Notwithstanding I have an action against thee, that thou sufferest the filthy Strumpet Jezebel to corrupt the bodies and soules of my servants, by permitting corporall fornication to them, and committing spirituall with them, whose judgement sleepeth not, no not in her bed, but even there shall surprise her. For behold, I will cast her into a bed: where she hath cast her selfe in wantonnesse, I will cast her in great weaknesse, and will make her bed of pleasure a racke to torment her: Ubi peccavit punietur, where she swilled in her stolne waters that rellished so sweet in her mouth, shee shall take downe her bitter potion; Ubi oblectamentum ibi tormentum. Of which plagues of Jezebel, when God shall open the vials mouth: at this time I purpose to gather some few observations from the two former bran∣ches of this Scripture; but to insist wholly upon the third: in the explica∣tion whereof, when I have proved by invincible arguments that Jezebel is not to be tolerated; in the application I will demonstrate that the Pseudo-catholike Romane Church, otherwise called the Whore of Babylon, is Jeze∣bel, or worse, if worse may bee: as God shall assist mee with his Spirit, and endue mee with power from above, for which I beseech you all to joyn with mee in prayer. O most gracious God, &c. And to the Angel of the Church in Thyatira, write, &c. The Naturalists observe, that the thickest and best hony is that which is squeezed last out of the combe: and usually the daintiest dish is served in at the last course; and Musicians reserve the sweetest straine for their close: and Rhetoricians take speciall care of their peroration. The last speech of a dying friend leaves a deep impression in our hearts; and art, imitating nature, holdeth out the last note of the dying sound in the organ or voice: which considera∣tion should stirre up our religious thoughts and affections to entertain with greatest alacrity and singular respect the admonitions and prophecies deli∣vered in this booke, as being the last words of our Lords last will and testa∣ment,Sen. ep. 12. Gratissima sunt poma cùm fugiunt, deditos vino potatio extre∣ma delectu, &c. and the last breath as it were of the Spirit of God. If that of the Poet be true, that the beames of theEsse Phoebi dulcius solet lumen jamjam cadentis. Sunne shine most pleasantly at his setting, how pleasant and deare ought the light of this Propheticall booke be unto us, which is the last irradiation and glissoning of the Sunne of righteousnesse? In it discerne we may
1. Counsels, chapt. 2.3. 2. Predictions of the state of the Church. 1. Militant, from the 4th to the 21. 2. Triumphant, from the 21. to the end. The manner of delivery of both to Saint John, was by speciall revelati∣on; which you will better conceive, if you be pleased to take notice of the meanes, whereby all knowledge divine and humane is conveighed into the soule. As all water ariseth either from Springs below, or falleth from the Clouds above; so all knowledge is either gathered from the creatures by naturall reason, grounded upon experience, or immediately descendeth from the Father of lights, and is attained unto by supernaturall illumination. Supernaturall illumination is either 1. By ordinary inspiration, common to all the Pen-men of the ho∣ly Ghost, who wrote the dictates of the Spirit, and were so as∣sisted by him, that they could not set downe any thing amisse. 2. By extraordinary revelation; which may be either 1. Of things past, whereof there remaine no records, mo∣numents, or memorialls to furnish the writer of them: such was the story of Genesis before the Floud, where∣of Moses could bee no otherwise infallibly enformed, than by Gods revealing them unto him. 2. Of things to come, which is properly termed prophe∣cy; and this may be either 1. By instinct, when men or women fore-tell things to come, not knowing the certainty, or being ful∣ly perswaded of the things themselves. 2. Per raptum, or ravishing of Spirit, when they fore-tell such things, whereof they are infallibly assured, either 1. By voice, as Moses was. 2. By dreame, as Daniel. 3. By vision, as Esay, Ezekiel, Zechary, and o∣ther Prophets. By instinct I am easily induced to beleeve, that many, especially before their death, may fore-tell many things that come to passe shortly after; and I deny not but some also may per raptum, as I am perswaded John Hus did before his martyrdome in those words, which are stampt in the coyne of those dayes yet to be seen: Centum revolutis annis respondebitis Deo & mihi, after a hundred yeeres you shall bee called to an accompt for these things: about which time they were openly challenged for them by Martin
Luther, and other zealous Reformers. Yet are wee not to build our Chri∣stian faith upon any prophesies, save those only which holy men have set downe in Scripture, as they were guided by the holy Ghost. Among which this is to bee ranked, which Saint John received not from man or Angel, but fromCap. 1. V. 9, 10. Jesus Christ; not per instinctum, but per raptum, as himselfe testifi∣eth: I John, which also am your brother and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdome and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the Isle of Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. I was in the spirit on the Lords day, and heard behind mee a great voice as of a Trumpet. Note wee herein, that Saint John received this revelation in his exile or banishment, to teach us, that Gods servants may be banished out of their native soyle, and the Court of Princes, but not out of the Catholicke Church, or the presence of God. Secondly, Saint John received this prophesie as he was in the spirit, to intimate unto us, that this booke is of a spirituall interpre∣tation. Thirdly, he received it on the Lords day, to lesson us, that God most blesseth our meditations on this day; and that they must bee at peace with him, and free from worldly cares and businesse, who expect revelati∣ons from him. For the title of the booke of Apocalypse, or Revelation, it is taken either from the manner whereby it came to Saint John before mentioned, or from the matter herein contained, which is mysticall, hidden, and for the most part of things future, very obscure before the event and issue manifest them, not from Saint Johns manner of expressing them: for that for the most part is very intricate. For, as Plato sometimes spake of an obscure example, Exemplum, O hospes, eget exemplo, You had need to illustrate your example by another example; so of all the bookes in Scripture the booke of Revelation most needs a revelation and cleare exposition: in which, as Saint Jerome hath observed, Quot verba, tot Sacramenta, there are neere as many mysteries and figures, and aenigmaticall expressions, as words: for this is the booke spoken of in this booke,Apoc. 5.1. sealed with seven seales, answerable to the seven letters enclosed in it, directed to the seven Churches of Asia, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Sardis, Pergamus, Philadelphia, Laodicea, and Thya∣tira, which names are as it were a small table and short draught of the linea∣ments of these Churches. As Irenaeus his peaceable temper, and Lactan∣tius his milkie veine, and Eusebius his piety, and Chrysostomes golden mouth; and contrariwise Jacobs subtilty, and Edoms cruelty, and Nabals folly, and Seneca his end,Se necans. and Protesilaus his destiny were written in their names: Ovid. ep.Protesilae tibi nomen sic fata dedêre, victima quod Troiae prima futurus eras. so the speciall and most noted vertues and vices in these Churches may bee read by the learned in the Greeke tongue in their names. I dare not affirme, that the holy Ghost either imposed or made choice of these names, to inti∣mate any such thing; especially, because these names were given to these Cities, before they gave their names to Christ. Neither doe we reade, that these names at the first were put upon these Townes by men endued with a Propheticall spirit; but by their Heathen Founders or Governours: yet is
the correspondency between these names, and the condition of these Churches at the time when Saint John, as Christ his amanuensis, wrote these letters to them, very remarkable: and they may serve the learned as places in artificiall memory, to fixe the character of these Churches in them. 1. By the name Ephesus, so termed, quasi , or , signifying remis∣sion or slacking, they may bee put in minde of slacking or back-sliding, wherewith the Spirit upbraideth this Church,Cap. 2. Ver. 4. Thou hast left thy first love: remember whence thou art fallen, and repent. 2. By the name Smyrna, signifying lacrymam myrrhae, the dropping or teares of myrrhe, they may be put in mind of theVer. 10. cup of teares, which this Angel was to drinke: Yee shall have great tribulation for ten dayes. 3. By the name Pergamus, quasi , or , signifying be∣yond, or out of the bounds of marriage, they may be put in mind of the Ni∣colaitans abounding in this Church, who were great abusers ofVer. 15. marriage: Thou hast them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. 4. By the name Sardis, quasi , signifying fleshly, they may be put in minde of many in this Church that wereCap. 3. Ver. 4. fleshly given: for, as we reade, This Angel had but a few names which had not defiled their garments. 5. By the name Philadelphia, signifying brotherly love, they may bee put in minde of this vertue, whose proper worke it is, to cover multitude of sinnes; which because it was eminent in many of this Church, the Spirit covereth all her infirmities, and rebuketh her openly for nothing; but con∣trariwise commendeth her, and promiseth, because sheCa. 3. Ver. 10. had kept the word of his patience, to keep her from the houre of temptation. 6. By the name Laodicea, quasi , signifying the righteousnesse or customes of the people, they may bee put in minde of the condition of the common sort in this Church and else-where, who are well conceited of themselves, though (God knowes) for little cause: they imagine that they are very forward in the way that leades to eternall life, that they are rich and encreased with goods, and have need of nothing, when indeed (in their spi∣rituall estate) they are wretched, and miserable, and blind, and naked: Where∣fore the SpiritVer. 17. counselleth them to buy of him gold tryed in the fire, that they may be rich; and white raiment, that they may be clothed, and that the shame of their nakednesse doe not appeare: And, to annoint their eyes withVer. 18. eye-salve, that they may see. 7. Lastly, by the name Thyatira, so called, , signify∣ing to runne mad after, and spend ones selfe, they may bee put in minde of those in Thyatira, who ranne awhoring after Jezebel, and spent their e∣states upon her, and committed filthinesse with her:Cap. 2. Ver. 20. which because the An∣gel winked at, the Spirit sharply reproveth him. And to the Angel of the Church in Thyatira, write, I know thy workes, &c. Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, &c. These Verses resem∣ble the branches of theApoc. 22.2. tree of life, which bare twelve maner of fruits. 1. The first I gather from them is the dignity of the Ministers of the Gospel, to whom the Son of God writeth, stiling them Angels. To the An∣gel of Ephesus, of Smyrna, &c. 2. The second, the difference of degrees in the Ministry: for the Son of
God endorseth his letter not to the inferiour Ministers, which were many in each of these Churches, but to the Angel, in the singular number, the Bishop or Super-intendent of the place, to whom the government of the Church, and ordering Ecclesiasticall affaires chiefly, if not onely, apper∣tained. 3. The third is the glorious majesty and divinity of our Saviour, who was before stiled the Sonne of man, but is here called the Sonne of God, and described with eyes like a flame of fire, piercing through the thickest dark∣nesse; and with feet like fine brasse, walking through the midst of all the Churches, and yet no way defiled, according to the words of the Prophet, theHos. 14.9. waies of the Lord are undefiled. 4. The fourth is mildnesse in just reproofe: the physician of our soules, who hath cured all our wounds with the smart of his, prescribeth the weak Angel of Thyatira but one pill, and that a gentle one; yet see how he rowles it in sugar; I know thy workes, and thy love, &c. Of many faults he mentio∣neth but a few, and of those few insisteth but upon one. 5. The fifth is the condition of good workes, to which foure things are required; faith, love, service, and patience: they must be done in faith, pro∣ceed from the love of God, with a desire to doe him service thereby; and lastly, the performers of them must be constant in them, and resolve pati∣ently to endure all crosses and oppositions from men or Satan, who seek to stay them in their godly proceedings. 6. The sixth is growth in grace, or proficiency in godlinesse: those who were ever good are best at the last; I know thy workes, that they are more as the last than at the first. 7. The seventh is the state and condition of the Church Militant, which at the best is like the Moone at the full, in which wee may discerne some blacke spots. The sweetestEras. Adag. Omnibus ma∣lis punicis pu∣tridum gra∣num inest. Pomegranet hath some rotten graine, the fai∣rest beauty hath a freckle or wrinckle, the most orient Ruby a cloud, and the most reformed Church in the Christian world hath some deformity in her: InJames 3.1. many things we offend all, and many in all: they are but a few against whom the Sonne of God hath but a few things. Notwithstanding I have a few things. 8. The eighth is the duty of a Magistrate, who like a good Gardener is to plucke up noysome weeds by the rootes. It is not sufficient for him to doe no evill; he must not suffer it: the Angel is not here blamed for any sin of commission or omission in himselfe, but for the bare permission of evill in others: I have somewhat against thee, because thou sufferest. 9. The ninth is a caution to looke to the weaker sexe: for often the Di∣vell maketh of them strong instruments, to dispread the poyson of heresie.Hieron. ad Ctes. Simon Magus heresin condidit Hele∣nae meretricis adjutus auxi∣lio; Nicolaus Antiochenus omnium im∣munditiarum repertor, choros duxit foemineos, Marcion Romam praemisit mulierem, quae decipiendos sibi animos praepararet. Simon Magus had his Helena, Marcion his femall fore-runner, Apelles his Philumena, Montanus his Maximilla, Donatus his Lucillia, Elpidius his A∣gape, Priscillian his Galla, Arius the Prince his sister, Nicolaus Antioche∣nus his feminine troupes and quires, and all Arch-heretickes some strumpets or other, to serve them for midwives when they were in travell with mon∣strous and mishapen heresies: Thou sufferest the woman Jezebel. Yet to doe
the sexe right, I willingly acknowledge with Flacius Illyricus, that as the Divell hath used bad women in all times, as Brokers to utter his deceitfull and dangerous wares; so God hath made choice of many good women, to be conduits of saving grace, and great instruments of his glory. Not to goe out of this City of Thyatira for instance, we can produce a Lydia for a Je∣zebel; where the Divell now vented poyson by the impure mouth of Je∣zebel, God poured out before the sweet oyntment of the Gospel by the mouth of Lydia, whoseActs 16.14. heart he opened, that shee attended to those things which were spoken of Paul. 10. The tenth is an observation concerning the nature of Heresie, which fretteth like a canker; and if it be not looked to, corrupteth the sound mem∣bers of Christ: Thou sufferest the woman Jezebel to seduce my servants. 11. The eleventh is a consideration of the odious filthinesse of Idolatry, which the Scripture termeth the soules naughtinesse, and spirituall fornica∣tion: To commit fornication. 12. The last is a wholsome doctrine concerning the contagion of Ido∣latry, which not only infecteth our bodies and soules, but our meates and drinkes also, and turneth the food of the body into the poyson of the soule to such as familiarly converse and table with Idolaters, and feed upon the reliques of Idols sacrifices: And to eate things offered unto Idols. And to the Angel of the Church in Thyatira. Glorious things are spoken of you, O yee Ministers of the Word and Sacraments: Yee are stiled Em∣bassadours of the King of Heaven, Stewards of the houshold of faith, Inter∣preters of the Oracles of God, Dispensers of the mysteries of salvation, Kee∣pers of the Seales of grace: Yee are the Salt of the earth, the Light of the world, the Starres of the skie, nay, the Angels of Heaven: To the Angel. The Ministers of the Gospel resemble Angels in many things: 1. Angels areHeb. 1.14. ministring spirits, and the Preachers of the Gospel are spi∣rituall Ministers. 2. Angels, according to the derivation of their name in Greeke, areMatth. 11.10. Malac. 3.1. messengers of God, and the Ministers of the Gospel are1 John 1.5. messengers of Christ. 3. The dwelling of Angels is in Heaven, and there is or ought to be thePhil. 3.20. Our conversation is in heaven. conversation of the Ministers of the Gospel. 4. The life of Angels is a continuallMatth. 18.10 beholding the face of God; and what is the life of a good Minister, but a continuall contemplation of the di∣vine nature, attributes and workes? 5. The Angels gatherMat. 24.31. the Elect from the foure windes, and the Ministers of the Gospel gather the Church from all corners of the earth. 6. The AngelsApoc. 16.1. poure out the vialls of the wrath of God upon the earth, and the Ministers are appointed to denounce Gods judgements and plagues to the wicked world. 7. The Angels1 Cor. 15 52. sound Trumpets at the last resurrection, and the Ministers of the Gospel at the first. 8. When Christ was in an agony,Luke 22.43. there appeared an Angel strengthe∣ning him; and when Gods children are in greatest extremity, God sendeth the Ministers of the Gospel toJob 33.23. If there bee a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew to man his uprightnesse, &c. comfort them.
9. The Angels carry the soules of them that dye in the Lord into Abra∣hams bosome (Luke 16.22.) and the Ministers of the Gospel give them their passe, and furnish them with their last viaticum. Now, if it bee demanded why God so highly advanceth the dignity of the Ministry; I answer, to advance his glory: He lifteth up the silver Trum∣pets of Sion on high, that the sound of his praise may be heard the further. As the visible Sunne casteth a more radiant and bright beame upon Pearle and Glasse, which reflecteth them againe, than upon grosse and obscure bo∣dies that dead the rayes thereof; even so the Sunne of righteousnesse casteth the fairest lustre upon that calling, which most of all illustrateth his glory. To other vocations God calleth us, but this calleth us unto God: all other lawfull callings are of God, but of this God himselfe was: and if it bee a great honour to the noblest orders of Knighthood on earth, to have Kings and Princes installed into them; how can wee thinke too worthily of that sacred order, into which the Sonne of God was solemnly invested by hisPsal. 110.4. Father? I speake nothing to impeach the dignity of any lawfull professi∣on; make much of the Physicians of your body, yet not more than of the Physicians of your soule: yeeld honour and due respect to those that are skilfull in the civill and municipall Lawes; yet under-value them not, who expound unto you the Lawes of God. At least take not pride in disgracing them, who are Gods instruments to conveigh grace into your soules: grieve not them with your accursed speeches, who daily blesse you: load them not with slaunders and calumnies, who by their absolution and ghostly com∣fort ease you of the heavie burden of your sinnes: goe not about to thrust them out of their temporall estate, who labour by their Ministery to pro∣cure you an eternall. It is not desire of popular applause, or a sinister respect to our owne profit, but the zeale of Gods glory, which extorteth from us these and the like complaints against you. For if Religion might bee ad∣vanced by our fall, and the Gospel gaine by our losses, and God get glory by our dis-esteeme, we should desire nothing rather than to be accounted the off-scouring of all things on the earth, that so wee might shine hereafter like precious stones in the foundation of the celestiall Jerusalem. But if the Preachers and the Gospel, the Word and Sacraments, and the Ministers thereof: Religion and Priests, the Church and Church-men are so neere allies, that the dis-reputation of the one, is a great prejudice to the other, and the disgrace of the one, the despising of the other; if the truth wee pro∣fesse, if our Religion, if the Gospel, if Christ, if God suffer in the disgraces that are put upon our calling, and the manifold wrongs that are done to it, we must adjure you for your owne good, and deeply charge you in Gods cause, that as you looke to receive any good from him, so you take nothing sacrilegiously from the Church; as you hope to be saved by the Ministery, preserve the dignity and estimation thereof; be not cursed Chams in disco∣vering the nakednesse of your ghostly fathers. Alexander thought that he could not lay too much cost upon the deske, in which Homers Poems lay; and we daily see how those who take delight in musicke, beautifie and adorn the instrument they play upon with varnish, purfle, gilt painting, and rich lace: in like maner, if you were so affected as you should be at the hearing of the Word, if you were ravished with the sweet straines of the songs of
Sion, ye would make better reckoning of the Instruments and Organs of the holy Spirit, by which God maketh melodie in your hearts: yee would not staine with impure breath the silver trumpets of Sion, blowne not with winde, but with the breath of God himselfe: yee would not trample un∣der foot those Canes that yeeld you such store of Sugar, or rather of Manna. Yee will be apt enough, upon these and the like texts, to teach us our dutie, that we ought, as Messengers of God, to deliver his message faith∣fully, and as neere as we can in his owne words; as Angels to give our selves to divine contemplation, and endevour to frame our lives to a heavenly con∣versation. Let it not then be offensive to you to heare your dutie, which is as plaine to be read as ours, in the stile here attributed to the Pastour of La∣odicea, the Angell. It is that you entertaine your diligent and faithfull Pa∣stours, as theGal. 4.14. Ye received me as an Angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. Galathians did St. Paul, and as Monica did St. Ambrose, tan∣quam Angelos Dei, as the Angels of God; receive them as Abraham and Lot did the Angels sent from God unto them, defend them according to your power from wrong, and make them partakers of the best things where∣with God hath blessed you. Angelo, to the Angel, in the singular number, chiefe Pastour or Bishop of the Church. All Ministers, as I shewed you before, may challenge the title of Angels; but especially Bishops, who watch over other Ministers, as Angels over men; who are to order the affaires of the Church, and go∣verne the Clergie, as the Peripatetickes teach, that Angels direct and go∣verne the motions of the celestiall spheres: therefore Epiphanius, and St. Austine, and most of the later Interpreters also, paraphrase Angelo by E∣piscopo illic constituto: and verily the manner of the superscription, and the contents of the letter, and the forme of governement settled in all Churches at this time, make for this interpretation. For supposing more Ministers in London of equall ranke and dignitie as there are, who would indorse a letter on this manner, To the Pastour of London, unlesse he meant the Bishop or chiefe Pastour? Now it is evident out of the twentieth chapter of the Acts, ver. 17. and all ancient stories, that there were divers Ministers or Presbyters in each of these seven Churches: He therefore, to whom the let∣ter was addressed in particular, to the Angel, could be no other than the Bishop or Superintendent of the place; who is here blamed for suffering Jezebel to teach: which sheweth that he had Episcopall power and autho∣ritie to silence and suspend her, or any other erroneous Teacher within his Diocesse. What should I adde out ofLib. 3. c. 3. Irenaeus; Polycarpus ab Apostolis in ea quae est Smyrnae Ecclesiâ constitutus est Episcopus, quem nos vidimus in primâ aetate nostrâ; that the Angell of Smyrna was Bishop Polycarpus, or∣dained by the Apostles themselves, whom he himselfe saw in his younger years: Or out ofIn ep. ad Tit. l. 1. Toto orbe decretum est, ut unus Presby∣terelectus super∣poneretur cae∣teris, ad quem omnis Ecclesiae cura pertineret. Jerome, that to prevent schismes among Presbyters and Priests, Episcopall governement was established through the whole world? And let this suffice to be spoken of the office of this Angell: we will now consider of his charge, or that wherewith the Holy Ghost here bur∣deneth him, the toleration of heresie and idolatrie. I have a few things a∣gainst thee, That thou sufferest.Variam & miscellaneam Religionem in∣duxerunt scep∣tro tuendo, ne unquam conspi∣rare interse om∣nes possint. Diodorus Siculus reporteth that the ancient Kings
of Egypt made a kinde of medley of religion to serve their turne, that the people might thereby be distracted, and so disabled from attempting any thing against the State. And we reade likewise inEcclesiast. hist. l. 4. c. 27. Socrates, of Themistius, that he laboured to perswade Valens the Emperour, that God was well plea∣sed with varietie of sects, dum it a pluribus modis colitur, because by this tolera∣tion of divers religions God is worshipped after divers manners. And Father Parsons, with whomLib. 3. de rep. c. 7. Bodine the great Statesman of France, and CardinallIn Apolog. Allen, and WilliamIn his answer to the refor∣med Catholike. Bishop, Seminarie Priest, joyne hearts and pens, spen∣ding the strength of their wit, and flower of their learning in this argument of toleration; taking upon them to prove, first, in Thesi, that Religions, differing in substantiall points, and fundamentall grounds, are comportable in the same Kingdome: and in Hypothesi, that it is not only lawfull and expe∣dient, but also honourable for the King of Great Britaine to permit the pub∣licke profession and practice of the Romish Religion within his King∣domes. For the proofe of their Thesis they alledge but one text of Scrip∣ture, and that miserably wrested:Mat. 13.30. Sinite utraque crescere in messem, let both grow untill the harvest. The great want of Scriptures they strive in some sort to supply by conje∣ctures of reason, and examples of forreine States: but the fairest glosse they set upon their foule assertion, is from such plausible sentences of the ancient Fathers as these:Lactan l. 5. divin. institut. c. 14. & 20. Quis tam in∣solens, tam ela∣tus est, qui me vetet oculos in coelum tollere? quis imponat mihi necessita∣tem vel colendi quod nolim, vel non colendi quod velim? Nihil est tam voluntarium quam Religio, in quâ si ani∣mus sacrifican∣tis est aversus, jam sublata est, jam nulla est. Who is so proud as to forbid me to lift up my eyes to heaven? Who will impose a necessity upon me, either to worship that which I will not, or not to worship what I will? Nothing so much dependeth on the will as Religion, which is not Religion but Hypocrisie if the minde be averse from it.Tertul. ad Scapulam c. 2. Nec religionis est religionem cogere. It is a∣gainst Religion to enforce Religion, and constraine men to dissemble with God. Verily the chiefest point of Religion consisteth in the inward sacrifice of the heart, and devotion of the will: and how is it possible to devote ourBernard. in Cant. Fides sua∣denda, non im∣ponend. will against our will? This reason against forcing Religion seemed so forcible to Theodoricus, that he forbad all Inquisitions and Tortures in case of Re∣ligion. For other things (saith he) we may, Religion we cannot command. Neither was he singular in this his opinion: for upon the like grounds to his, Theodosius and Leo, Catholike Emperours, permitted Churches to the Arrian Heretikes; as likewise Constantius and Valentinian, Arrian Here∣tikes, granted Oratories to Catholike Bishops. The Emperours of Ger∣manie tolerate Lutherans and Zuinglians, the French King Hugonots, the Grand-Seignior Christians, the Pope Jewes in Rome; whereunto Bodin ad∣deth the example of the ancientAug. l. 18. de Civit. Dei. Ro∣ma, cum om∣nibus penè gen∣tibus domina∣retur, omnium penè gentium survivit errori∣bus. Romans, who permitted the free use of their Religion to all the Nations they conquered: and of the Emperour A∣lexander Severus, who kept in his closet the pictures of Abraham, Orpheus, Hercules and Christ, and privily worshipped them all. These are the fairest pretences, and plausiblest arguments for toleration. How few in number? how light in weight? how easie and short in the an∣swer? First, for their text of Scripture (let both grow to the harvest) which Doctor Bishop setteth in the fore-front of his discourse. Can any man of learning and judgement once dreame, that our Lords meaning was thereby to inhibite all proceedings against Heretikes and wicked livers? to enjoyne all Magistrates to suffer vertue and vice, truth and heresie to grow together
in the Church till the harvest, that is, the end of the world? Could Doctor Bishop or any other Papist perswade himselfe that our Saviour commandeth that to be done, for which he here blameth the Angell ofMat. 13.30. Thyatira, and before the Angell ofVer. 14. Pergamus? Doe not all Papists defend the Inquisiti∣on in Spaine and Italie, and the Pope their Master his proceedings against Protestants, under the name of Heretikes? Certainely if Christ in this pa∣rable absolutely commands a toleration of Heretickes and Schismatikes, under the name of tares, the Popish Inquisition is a transgression of Christs command, by their owne inference from it: which if any Papist maintaine, he will not be long out of the Inquisition: if he trust not to his heeles he shall feele the gag soone in his mouth, and assay theSee the book of the Spanish Inquisition, and in it the forme of this bridle. man-bridle. As for the meaning of the place of Scripture, it is cleere in it selfe, and hath been long agoe by the Ancients declared to be this, that God suffereth hypocrites and dissemblers to mingle themselves with godly Professours in the visible Church, whom because we cannot sufficiently discerne and di∣stinguish, who know not the hearts of men, he forbiddeth us to attempt an universall and utter extirpation of them, in this respect only, ne simul eradice∣mus triticum, lest together with cockle and darnell, or in stead thereof, we pluck up good wheat. What maketh this for the toleration of open Idolatours, and known Heretikes, or scandalous livers, who if they be not weeded out by ex∣ecution of penall Statutes or Ecclesiasticall censures, will hinder the growth of all vertue and Religion? Wherefore the case being so cleere, that this text of Scripture is shamefully wrested by the Adversarie, I leave the Patrons of toleration to be disciplined by the JesuitMald. in hunc loc. Abu∣tuntur hoc loco ut probent aut non puniendos aut non occi∣dendos haereti∣cos. Maldonat, who in his Comment upon this text, strikes them smartly with his feruler that abuse this place (as he saith) to prove that Heretikes are not at all to be punished, or not to be pu∣nished with death. I come to the ancient Fathers, who indeed justly taxe the heathen for fol∣lie and crueltie, in forcing their idolatrous worship upon Christians by the sword, which they were never able, nor so much as once offered to main∣taine by argument. Against all such, who terrifie and teach not, as St. Au∣stine speaketh, or begin with fire and faggot, or have no sharper weapons to defend the truth of their Religion than the edge of the axe, or point of the sword, Lactantius and Tertullians exceptions are just, and their admoniti∣ons seasonable.Lact. divin. instit. l. 5. c. 20. Verbis potiùs quàm verberi∣bus res agenda est ut sit volun∣tas: distringant aciem ingenio∣rum suorum; si ratio eorum ve∣ra est, afferatur, parati sumus au dire; doceant, tacentibus certè nihil credimus, sicut nec sae vi∣entibus quidem cedimus. Let the heathen draw the sword of their wits, and trie it at the point of argument. They dislike not, after gentle remedies have proved uneffectuall, to use severitie against obstinate Heretikes. For though Saint Bernard saith truely, Fides suadenda, non imponenda; faith is to be perswa∣ded, not to be imposed upon a man: yet Tertullian affirmeth as truely in ano∣ther case, Contumacie is to be dealt roughly withall, durities vincenda est, non suadenda, obstinacie is to be compelled, not perswaded. Yea, but faith is the gift of God, and cannot be forced upon a man a∣gainst his will. Neither can any morall vertue: and yet Drunkards, and In∣continent persons, and Theeves, and Murderers, are justly punished. And why not as well Miscreants, Idolatours, and Heretikes? Faith indeed is the gift of God, yet he neither giveth it, nor preserveth it in us without meanes, whereof one of the chiefe is the strict execution of Ecclesiasticall discipline, and Imperiall lawes, whereby all the Diocesse ofAug. ep. 48. Hippo cum tota esset in parte Donati, ad unitatem ca∣tholicam timo∣re legum im∣perialium con∣versa est. Hippo was reclaimed
from the heresie of the Donatists: ReligionLactan. loc. sup cit. Non est opus vi & injuria, quia Religio cogi non potest. cannot be enforced. It is a true proposition, if it be rightly understood, but no way maketh for toleration of errour, or against wholsome lawes, for the preservation of the purity of Religion. For the acts of Religion are of two sorts: 1 Inward, as beliefe and affiance in God, hope and charity. 2 Outward, as to goe to Church to heare Sermons, to be present at the administring of the Sacraments, to make open profession of our faith by word of mouth, or writing: to these men may bee compelled by penall Statutes. Health cannot be forced upon a sicke man, yet his mouth may be violently opened with a spoone, and that cordiall water powred downe his throat, which may bee a good meanes under God to recover his health. To this purpose Saint Austine speakethEpist. 48. Utrisque mo∣lestus est, u∣trosque tamen amat. appositely: Hee that by a smart blow rowseth a man in a Lethargie, or by maine force bindes a mad man, is troublesome to both, yet doth a good office to both. Yea, but is it not cruelty to trouble men or women for their conscience? to compell people by violent meanes, to communicate with that service which in their heart they abhorre? supposing it to bee the true worship of God to which the State compelleth (though they that are forced to it deem otherwise) to enforce them in this case to it, is no persecution at all, but execution rather of Gods Law: or, if they will needs have it termed a per∣secution, I distinguish with SaintAug ep. 50. Est persecutio justa quam fa∣cit impiis Ec∣clesia, & est persecutio in∣justa quam fa∣ciunt impii Ec∣clsiae: & ep. 48. lanè semper & mali persecuti sunt bonos, & boni malos; illi no∣cendo per in∣justitiam, hi consulendo per disciplinam, illi immaniter, isti temperan∣ter, illi perse∣quuntur sani∣tatem, hi pu∣tredinem. Austine of a double persecution. 1. A just, which the Church of God raiseth against the wicked for their impieties. 2. Unjust, which the wicked, when they are in place, raise against the godly for the truths sake. The former proceeds from love and zeale, and intends instruction; the later from malice and cruelty, and intends destruction: the one wounds by injustice, the other heales by discipline; that lets out the corrupt, this spills the life bloud. Now for the examples of toleration of divers Religions, they are either in such places where there are divers Regiments and Sove∣raignties; as in Germany, where each Prince maintains that Religion which he is perswaded in his conscience to bee the right: or of Princes which could doe no other, as things then stood with them; as Theodosius, who for a while bare with the Arrians, but as soone as hee had strength enough a∣gainst them, prohibited them all meetings, deprived them of the benefit of making Wills, and forbad all disputing about the equality of the persons in the Trinity, as we may reade in Sozomen and Theodoret: or they are of He∣retickes, Turkes and Infidels, and so no good presidents for Orthodoxe Christians. In briefe, they are all either impertinent or inconsequent, and are over-borne with stronger reasons, and more uncontrollable authorities on the contrary; which before I martiall in their order, I will set downe certaine distinctions and cautions for the clearer manifestation of the truth. 1. First, by divers Religions, we understand Religions differing in main grounds and substantiall points of faith, not in the outward forme of disci∣pline, much lesse in the habit or furniture of Rites and Ceremonies onely. Diversities of Rites and Ceremonies have been alwayes in the Catholike Church without breach of unity. The Spouse of Christ weareth a gar∣ment
wrought about with divers colours: And the Musicians will tell us, that some discords in a lesson, binding wise (as they speake) and falling into a con∣cord, much grace the musicke. 2. Secondly, wee wish that all Magistrates Ecclesiasticall and Civill, would first make proofe of gentler remedies, and seeke rather to winne men by perswasions, than draw them to Church by compulsion; Monendo po∣tiùs quàm minando, & verbis magis quàm verberibus, to use rather commo∣nitions than comminations, words than blowes, discourses than legall cour∣ses, arguments than torments. 3. Thirdly, in making and executing penall Statutes against Heretickes and Idolaters, all Christian Princes and States must wash their hands from bloud, and free themselves from all aspersion of cruelty. For no fish will come into the net which they see all bloudy: and they who are too quick in plucking at those that differ from them in Religion, root up those oft-times for tares, which if they had been permitted longer to grow, might have proved good corne. 4. Fourthly, they must put a great difference between those that are in∣fected with Hereticall opinions, whereof some are ring-leaders, some are followers, some are obstinate, others flexible, some are turbulent, others peaceable; on some they ought to haveJude 22, 23. compassion, making a difference; and others save with feare, pulling them out of the fire. 5. Lastly, nothing must be done herein by the intemperate zeale of the heady multitude, or any private motion; but after mature advice and deli∣beration be appointed by lawfull authority. To the particular instances brought from our neighbour Nations that are repugnant to this rule, wee answer with SaintSerm. 66. in Cant. Appro∣bamus zelum, factum non laudamus. Bernard: Wee approve their zeale, yet wee allow not of their proceedings. These cautions observed, that religions differing in fundamentall grounds are not to be tolerated in the same Kingdome, we prove 1. First, by the Law ofDeut. 22.10, 11. Moses, which forbiddeth plowing with an Oxe and an Asse together: or, to weare a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and linnen together. The morall of which Law, according to the interpreta∣tion of the best Expositors, hath a reference to diversities in Religions, and making a kinde of medley of divers worships of God. 2. Secondly, by the grievous punishment of Idolaters appointed by God himself:Deut. 13.6, 8, 9. If thy brother, or son of thy mother, or thine own son, or thy daughter, or the wife that lieth in thy bosome, or thy friend, which is as thine own soule, en∣tice thee secretly, saying, Let us goe and serve other gods, thine eye shall not pity him, neither shalt thou keep him secret, but thine hand shall be upon him, and then the hand of all the people to stone him to death: Solùm pietatis genus est hic esse crudelem, It is piety in this kinde to shew no pity. It is not in the power of Kings and Princes to reverse the decrees of Almighty God, or falsifie his Oracles, who saith, NoMatth. 6.24. man can serve two masters. For what fellow∣ship hath righteousnesse with unrighteousnesse? and what2 Cor. 6.14, 15, 16. communion hath light with darknesse? or what concord hath Christ with Belial? and what agree∣ment hath the Temple of God with Idols? 3. Thirdly, if these testimonies of everlasting truth perswade us not, that God, who is truth, must be worshipped in truth, and not with lyes, and
in a false manner; yet Christ his inditing the Angel of Thyatira for suffe∣ring Jezebel, and the Angel of Pergamus for not silencing false Teachers: I have a few things against thee (saith the Spirit) that thou hast there them that maintaine the doctrine of Baalam. The Spirit chargeth not the Angel with allowing or countenancing, but tolerating only false doctrine: There∣fore the toleration of Heresie and Idolatry is a sinne which God will not tolerate in a Magistrate; which I further thus demonstrate: 4. Fourthly, God will not hold any Prince or State guiltlesse, which permitteth a pollution of his name; but the worship of a false god, or the false worship of the true God, is a pollution of his name, as himselfe decla∣reth:Ezek. 20.39. Pollute my name no more with your gifts and your Idols. God is a jealous God, and will endure no corrivall; if wee divide our heart between him and any other, hee will cut us off from the land of the living, as hee threatneth: IZeph. 1.5. will cut off the remnant of Baal, and them that worship the host of Heaven upon the house tops, and them that worship and sweare by the Lord, and by Malcham. 5. Fifthly, what shall I adde hereunto save this, that the bare permis∣sion of Idolatry was such a blurre to Solomon, and most of the succeeding Kings of Juda, that it obscured the lustre, and marred the glosse of all their other Princely endowments? For after the description of their vertues, this blot is cast upon their reputation; But the high1 Kin. 15.14. places were not taken away. But thrice happy2 Kin. 18.4. Hezekiah, who by demolishing the brasen Serpent which Moses had made (because the children of Israel burned incense to it) erected to himselfe an everlasting monument of praise. And yet more happy2 Kin. 23.25. Jo∣siah, after whom the Holy Ghost sendeth this testimony: Like unto him there was no King before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soule, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses, neither after him arose there any like unto him. Why? what eminent vertues had Josiah above others? what noble acts did he, which the Spirit values at so high a rate? no other than those which we find recounted in the books of Kings and Chronicles: Hee brake downe the Altars of Baalim, and cut downe the Images that were on high upon them, hee brake also the groves and the carved Images, and the molten2 Chron. 34.4, 5. Images, and stamped them to powder, and strewed it upon the graves of them that sacrificed to them; and hee burned the bones of the Priests upon the Altar. He defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make2 Kin. 23.10, 11, 12, 13. his sonne or his daughter passe through the fire to Moloch: and he took away the horses that the Kings of Judah had given to the Sun, and the Altars that were on the top of the upper chambers of Ahaz, & the Altars which Manasseh had made in the two Courts of the house of the Lord, and the high places that were before Jerusalem, which Solomon had builded, and so he tooke away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and2 Chro. 34.33. compelled all that were found in Israel to serve the Lord their God. 6. Sixthly, farther to teach Magistrates, that they ought sometimes to use violent and compulsive meanes, to bring men to the true service of God; our Saviour delivereth a Parable of a certaineLuke 14.16. man that made a great Supper, and when the guests that were bid came not in, the Master said to his servants,Ver. 23. Goe to the high wayes and hedges, to compell them to come in, that my
house may be filled. On which ground St.In hunc. loc. Non quia co∣gantur repre∣hendant, sed quò cogantur attendant. Austine thus descanteth, What are the hedges here meant, but schismes and heresies, that make partitions and se∣parations in the house of God? from which when the sheepe of Christ are pulled, let them not find fault because they are haled, but looke whither they are haled, into Christs sheepfold. A prudent advice, and seriously to be thought upon by all that murmure and repine at the Church and States proceedings a∣gainst obstinate Recusants, be they Papists or Brownists: they could not mislike that they are compelled, if they entered into a serious consideration whither they are compelled to goe, to wit, to a marriage Supper, to partake of the Manna of the Word and Sacraments. O happy violence, that puls men out of hell fire, happie bonds that tye us to Christs body, happy fetters that hold our feet in the way of peace, happy scourges and whips that drive us into heaven, happy outward compulsion that workes inward compunction! 7 Seventhly, to these constraining arguments for compulsories against refractarie persons, we may adde infinite examples of zealous Princes, to counterpoize all the presidents brought before for connivencie at schisme or heresie. I spake but even now of Josiah and Hezekiah, after whom may be ranked2 Chr. 15.16. And all the peo∣ple sware unto the Lord with a loud voyce, with shouting, trum∣pets, and cor∣nets, that who∣soever would not seeke the Lord God of Israel should be slaine. Asa, who deposed Maacath his mother from her Regencie, because she had made an Idol in a grove, which he brake downe, and stamped to pow∣der. And Nebuchadnezzar made a Decree, That every people, nation and language, which spake any blasphemie against the God of Shadrach, Misach, and Abednego, should be drawne in pieces, and their houses made a jakes, Dan. 3.29. And that I may joyne Ecclesiasticall stories with the inspired, I will relate some constitutions of the best Emperours which swayed the Roman Scepter.Euseb. in vit. Constant. Constantine the Great appointed that all the Temples of Heretickes should be pulled downe, and that it should not be lawfull for them to assemble together in publike or private. And that Theodosius and later Em∣perours were as quicke against them, it appeares by the Code of Justinian;Lib. 1. tit. 5. Omnes vetitae legibus divinis, & imperialibus constitutionib{us} haereses perpe∣tuò conticescant Let all heresies, forbidden by the law of God and Imperiall sanctions, keepe silence for ever. And againe,Tit. cunc. Cuncti haeretici procul dubiò noverint om∣nia sibi loca a∣dimenda esse. Let all Heretickes understand, that all places of meeting, as well Churches as private houses, are to be taken away from them: let them be debarred from all service day and night, the Lord Deputie to be fined a hundreth pound if he permit any such thing. Will you heare yet sharper lawes? Peruse the chapter of Manicheos.Manicheos meritissimâ severitate per∣sequimur, ac primum volu∣mus publicum esse crimen, quia quod in re∣ligionem divi∣nam committi∣tur, in omnium fertur injuriam: & in eos severi∣tatis nostrae acu∣lei erigantur, qui eos domi∣bus suis dam∣nandá provisi∣one defendunt. We prosecute the Ma∣nichees with most deserved severitie; and first we determine that this heresie shall be held a publike crime: because that which derogateth from the true worship of God, cannot but be many wayes prejudiciall to the State. These Ma∣nichees therefore we punish with confiscation of goods, we debarre them from buying or selling, bequeathing goods or lands by will or otherwise, from recove∣ring any legacies, or enjoying their fathers inheritance: and let them all be li∣able to the same penalties who keepe and foster such persons in their houses. 8 Eighthly, for the mitigation of which lawes, when the Hereticks ex∣pected that S. Austine should mediate with the Emperor, he falls thus foule upon them: Yes forsooth, what else? I shall gainesay the constitution of the Emperour, and intercde that you lose not the things which you call yours, and you without feare spoyle Christ of that which is his? A reasonable demand, is it not? that the Roman lawes should permit you to make your last will and testa∣ment,
whilest you with cavelling and sophistry goe about to frustrate Gods last will and Testament? that in buying and selling your contracts may be good, and you the whilest share among you that which Christ bought when he was sold? that you be not banished from the place of your abode, when you, as much as in you lieth, drive Christ from the Kingdome purchased with his blood? Ter∣tullian is as peremptory in this point:Scorpiacum c. 2. Ad offici∣um haereticos compelli, non illici dignum; dutia vincen∣da est non sua∣denda: & uti∣que satis opti∣mum praeudi∣catur quod pro∣babitur a Deo constitutum. We must deale roundly with Here∣tickes, and overcome their obstinacie by more powerfull Rhetorike than per∣swasive speeches. For that course must be thought the best which God himselfe hath taken. St.Cypr. ep. 6. Cyprian pointeth to those texts of Scripture, wherein God alloweth of, yea, and expressely commandeth severe proceedings against Heretickes and Idolatours: with whom St.Greg. com. in Cant. Gregorie accords in his note upon those words, Catch the foxes that spoyle the vines. Of the same minde areHier. in Crs. Leo. ep. 93. Hierome, Leo, and the Synod of Burdigala, who all approve of Maxi∣mus his proceedings against the Hereticke Priscillian; and Epiphanius and Cyrill, who, to strike a terrour in the hearts of Heretickes, relate the fleaing of Manes, the father of the Manichees, by the King of Persia. To fill up the ranke:Lib. 3. cont. Parm. Optatus likeneth Macarius to Phineas and Elias, for making a quicke dispatch with the Heretickes of his time. Dioscorus Alexandrinus cries out in the Synod of Chalcedon, that Heresie is to be purged with fire, Haereticos flammâ dignos. Clemens Alexandrinus wisheth all happinesse to the Scythian King, who hung a Citizen, and after commanded him to be shot through with arrowes, for sacrificing to the mother of the gods, after the man∣ner of the Grecians.Ep. ad Ser. Procul dubio melius esset ut gladio coerce∣rentur illius, qui sine causà gladium non gestat. Lastly, St. Bernard, after he had made mention of some private persons, who ranne upon blasphemous Heretickes, and tare them in pieces for rending the Church, interposeth his owne judgement in this maner; They should have done better, to have delivered up those blasphemous Heretickes into the hands of the Magistrate, who beareth not the sword of justice in vaine. 9 Ninthly, if these pious resolutions of the ancient Fathers, and noble acts of religious Princes, serve not as matches to kindle the zeale of godly Magistrates against the enemies of our Religion, the heathen shall one day rise up against them; the ancient Romans, who had this law written among the rest,Leg. 12. tab. Deos privatos nemo habeat. Let no man have a private Religion to himselfe: the Athenians, who banished Protagoras for that atheisticall speech of his, de diis, Sintne, an non sint, nil habeo dicere; I can say nothing concerning the gods, whether there are any, or not; and put Socrates to deathPlato in a∣polog. Socr. . because he made question of the truth of that Religion which the State professed. In a word, all nations of the world shall condemn them, of whomSeneca sent. Violatarum re∣ligionum apud diversas gentes diversa statui∣tur poena, apud omnes aliquo. Seneca writeth truly, that for the profaning, violating, or corrupting the worship of God there are divers punishments appoin∣ted in divers places, but in all Countries some or other. And not without cause: for if it be a scandall to a State to suffer theeves & murtherers to go unpuni∣shed, are Hereticks to be set free, who rob men of that pearle of truth which the rich merchant man sold all that he had to buy? who are guilty of spiritu∣all homicide? wherewith St.Tract. 11. in Johan. Videtis qualia faciant, & qulia pati∣untur; occi∣dunt animas, affliguntur in corpore, sem∣piternas mortes faciunt, & tem∣porales se per∣peti conque∣runtur. Austine directly chargeth them; You see what these miscreants doe, and what they suffer; and have they, thinke you, any just cause to complaine of the punishments that are inflicted on them? They kill the soules of men, and smart for it in their bodies: by their damnable doctrine they bring men to eternall death, and yet grudge that they suffer a temporall. Doe
not all wise men account Religion to bee the foundation which beareth up the whole frame and fabricke of State? And is it possible a building should stand upon two foundations? Religion is the soule which animateth the great body of the Common-wealth, and will it not prove a monster if it be informed with divers soules? The Church and Common-wealth have but one centre; any new motion therefore in the one must needs make a com∣motion in the other. In which regard Mecoenas advised Augustus to punish severely all Innovators in matter of Religion,Non solum deorum causâ, sed quia nova quaedam numi∣na hi tales in∣ducentes, mul∣tos impellunt ad rerum mu∣tationem. not only out of a regard of pie∣tie, but also for reason of State. What mutinies, what heart-burnings, what jealousies, what bloudy frayes and massacres may there be feared, where Religion setteth an edge upon discontent? And all that dye in these quar∣rels pretend to the Crowne of Martyrdome. I forbeare multiplicity of examples in this kind, our neighbour Countries have bin for many yeeres the stages whereon these tragedies for Religion have been acted, and God alone knowes what the catastrophe will be. There was never so great mis∣chiefe done at Rome by fire, as when it took the Temple of Vesta, and min∣gled it selfe with the sacred flame. Ovi. fast. l. 6. Ardebant sancti sceleratis ignibus ignes, Et mista est flammae flamma prophana piae. Even so if the wild-fire of contention mixe it selfe with the sacred fire of zeale, and both burne within the bowels of the same Church, it is not a ri∣ver of bloud that is like to quench the direfull flame. ThereforeEp. 166. Julia∣nus reddidit Basilicas haere∣ticis quando templa Demo∣nus, eo modo putans Chri∣stianum no∣men posse pe∣tire de tes, si unitati Eccle∣siae, de qua lap∣sus fuerat, invi∣deret, & sacri∣legs dinsio∣nes liberas esse prmitteret. Julian the Apostata, as S. Austine reports, having a desire to set all Christendome in a combustion, cast a fire-ball of contention among them, by proclaiming liberty to all Heretickes and Schismatickes to set abroach their damnable doctrines, hoping thereby utterly to extinguish the name of Christians. But to come neere to our Adversaries, and turne their owne ordnance upon them: Did Queene Mary in her short reigne exempt the servants of God of any age or sexe from the mercilesse flames of the fire? Doe not Bellarmine, Allan, Parsons, Pammelius, Maldonat, and generally all Jesuits, set their wits upon the rack, and stretch and torture them, to maintaine the rackes and tortures of Popish Inquisition? Of what hard metall then are their foreheads made, who dare supplicate for a toleration in a Prote∣stant state, able to suppresse them? Why should they not be contented with their owne measure, though all the world knoweth the sweet benignity and clemency of our gracious Soveraign abates them more than the halfe? Here me thinkes I heare the soules of the slaine under the Altar cry. How long Lord, holy & just, dost not thou revenge the bloud of thy servants spilt as water upon the ground by the Whore of Babylon, which to this day out-bra∣veth thy Spouse, having dyed her garments scarlet red in the goare of thy Saints, and Martyrs of thy Son Jesus Christ? Righteous Lord, wee have been made a spectacle of misery to Angels and men, wee have been killed all the day long, and accounted as sheep for the slaughter; wee have been spoiled of all our goods, banished our native soile; we have been hewen asunder, wee have been slaine with a sword, we have been whipt, scour∣ged, cast into dungeons with serpents, burnt at a stake to ashes, some of us
digg'd out of our graves, and martyred after our death: and she that hath thus cruelly butchered thy servants sits as Queene, arrayed in purple, and scarlet, and fine linnen, and carouseth healths to the Kings and Princes of the earth in a cup of gold; and after shee hath made them drunke with the wine of her abominations, she committeth spirituall filthinesse with them in the face of the Sun. Cupio me patres conscripti clementem, non dissolutum videri (saith the wise Oratour) I wish that mercy, to which all vertues (as Seneca obser∣veth) willingly give the place and yeeld the garland, may be still the prime gemme in our Soveraignes Crowne. I plead for mercy, which must be our best plea at Christs Tribunall: but I desire it to bee well thought upon, whether it be mercy or not rather cruelty to spare those who spare not your sonnes and daughters, but daily entice them, and by their agents conveigh them over beyond the Sea, to sacrifice, not their bo∣dies, but their soules, their faith, their religion to the Moloch of Rome.Plin. nat. hist. l. 8 c. 22. Arca∣des scribunt ex gente Antei cuiusdam in stagnum quod∣dam regionis ejus duci, vesti∣tu{que} in qurcu suspenso na∣re & abire in desertum, trans∣figuratique in lupos. Pliny writeth of certaine people of the family of Anteus in Arcadia, who having put off their clothes, and swom over a deep standing poole, wander in the wildernesse, runne among Wolves, and are transformed into their shape, and after returne backe and doe great mischiefe in their owne countrey. I beleeve not that there is any such family in Ar∣cadia; but I am sure wee have a sort of men in England, who, put∣ting off the habit of English men and Scholars, crosse the narrow Seas, converse with Romish Wolves, and degenerate into their nature, and after they returne backe into their owne countrey, make havocke of Christs flocke. Here I cannot but cry aloud with zealous Bullenger,In Apoc. c. 2. Quae quaeso clementia est crudelissimis lupis blandiri, ut oves inno∣centes Christi sanguine re∣demptas impu∣nè dilnient? quae haec pati∣entia sinere vi∣neam Domini ab immanissi∣mis monstris devastati? What clemency call you this, to suffer the Lords Vineyard to bee spoiled and laid waste by cruell Monsters? What mercy to spare the Wolves, which spare not Christs sheep redeemed with his precious bloud? who plot trea∣son against their naturall Prince, scandalize the State, and staine with impure breath the gold and silver vessels of the Sanctuary, who turne religion into Statisme, or rather into Atheisme. Let it bee accoun∣ted mercy not to execute the rigour of penall Statutes upon silly sedu∣ced sheep; certainly it is cruelty to spare the Wolves which worry them. If any, pricked at the heart at the consideration of these things, say with the Jewes in the Acts,Acts 2.37. Quid faciemus? What shall wee doe? Wee have used all diligence to find out these Romish Wolves, and those that come within our reach wee smite, at the rest we set our strongest Mastives, and fray them out of our coasts: I answer, If this were sincerely done of all hands, if some shepheards were not seen by the Wolves before they spie them, and thereby lost their voi∣ces, according to the Proverb, Lupi videre priores: I say if the shepheards and the dogges bestirred themselves as they should, yet the wise man in Livie will tell them, All will be to no great purpose till the woods and thickets be cut down, to which they flie, & there hide themselves:
Nunquam defuturi sunt lupi donec sylvae exscindantur: you shall never be rid of these Romish wolves so long as in all quarters of this Kingdome they have so many places of shelter to lurke in, I had almost sayd Sanctuaries of defence. I am now come home to the point, I first thought upon when I was som∣moned to speake to this honourable assembly,This Sermon was preached during the Par∣liament, where∣of many were present. consisting of so many noble and worthy members of the high Court of Parliament; and therefore here I will land my discourse, after I have given you but one memento out of the Psalmist, Remember the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem, how they sayd, Downe with it, downe with it, even to the ground; or rather, Up with it, up with it to the trembling ayre. Blow up King, Queene, Prince, Parliament, Clergie, Laitie, Nobilitie, Gentrie, Commons, Lawes, Sta∣tutes, Charters, Records, all in a cloud of fire, that there remaine not so much as any cinders of them upon the earth, lest perhaps the Phoenix might revive out of her owne ashes. But praysed be the God of heaven, who discovered and defeated that plot of hell, our soule is escaped as a bird out of the snare, the snare is broken, and we are delivered. I will close up all with those sweet straines of the hundred forty ninth Psalme. O sing unto the Lord a new song, let his praise be heard in the great congregation: let Israel rejoyce in him that made him, and let the children of Sion be joy∣full in their King: for the Lord hath pleasure in his people, and will make the meeke glorious by deliverance: let the Saints be joyfull with glory, let them rejoyce in their beds: let the high Acts of the Lord be in their mouthes, and a two-edged sword in their hands, to execute vengeance up∣on the Romish Jezebel, and rebuke her proselites; to bind her Priests in chaines, and her Chemarims with linkes of iron, that they may be avenged of them: as it is written, Such honour have all his Saints. To whom, &c.
JEZEBEL SET OUT IN HER COLOURS. A Sermon preached in Saint Pauls Church, Novemb. 20. Anno 1614. THE XXXIV. SERMON. REVEL. 2.20. Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth her selfe a Prophetesse, to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eate things sacrificed unto Idols. Right Honourable, Right Worshipfull, &c. IN this letter, indited by the Spirit, and penned by St. John, I observed heretofore, 1 Superscription: and therein 1 The party from whom, with his eminent quality, the Sonne of God, &c. 2 The partie to whom it was sent, with the title of his dignity, the Angel of Thyatira. 2 The contents: which are so manifold, and of such im∣portance, that if I had the tongue of an Angel I could hardly deliver them all in particular. I have heretofore presented you with twelve sorts of fruits an∣swerable to the fruits of the tree of lifeApoc. 22. described, all growing upon the two former branches of this Scripture, and this of my text; and yet I have not ga∣thered the halfe. It resembleth that wonderfull tree which Pliny saw atLib. 17. c. 16. nat. hist. Arbo∣rem vidimus uxta Tiburtes Tulias omni genere pomorum onustam, alio ramo nucibus, alio baccis, aliunde vite, ficis, pyris, punicis, malorum{que} generibus. Ti∣burts, which bare all kind of delicious and wholesome fruits. Seneca his obser∣vation
is true, thatSen ep. 23. ad Lucil. Levium metallorum fructus in sum∣mo est, illa opu∣lentissima sunt quorum in alo latet vena assi∣doè plenius re∣sponsura fodi∣enti. baser metals are found neere the top, but the richer lie deep in the earth, affording great store of precious oare. Such is the Mine I have discovered in this passage of Scripture: into which that you may search deeper, with more profit and lesse danger, I will beare before you a cleere light, made of all the expositions of the best learned Scribes in the house of God, who, to enrich our faith, bring forth out of their treasuries new things and old. And to the Angel, that is, the Bishop or chiefe Pastour, as heretofore I proved at large unto you. In the Old Testament we reade of the ministery of Angels; but here we finde Angels of the ministery, to whom the Sonne of God himselfe kindly and familiarly writeth. Our usuall forme of som∣moning your attention is, Hearken unto the word of God, as it is written; which here I must change, and say, Hearken unto the word of God, as it wri∣teth. For to the Angel of Thyatira the second Person, which is the Word of God, thus writeth. Write. It is a great honour to receive a letter from a noble Personage: how much more from the Sonne of God? St.E. 40. Quid est aliud Scrip∣ture sacra n i quaedam episto∣la Omnipoten∣tis Dei ad crea∣turam suam. Gregorie excellently am∣plifieth upon this point in his epistle to Theodorus the Physician: If your excellencie (saith he) were from the Court, and should receive a letter from the Emperour, you would never be quiet till you had opened it, you would never suffer your eyes to sleepe, nor your eye lids to slumber, nor the temples of your head to take any rest, till you had read it over againe and againe. Behold, the Emperour of heaven, the Lord of men and Angels, hath sent you a letter for the good of your soule, and will you neglect to peruse it? Peruse it, my son studie it, I pray thee, meditate upon it day and night. Where letters passe one from another, there is a kinde of correspondencie and societie; and such honour have all Gods Saints: they have fellowship with the Father and the Sonne. O let us not sleighten such a societie, whereby we hold intelligence with heaven: let us with all reverence receive, and with all diligence peruse, and with all carefulnesse answer letters and messages sent from the Sonne of God, by returning sighes and prayers backe to heaven, and making our selves, in the Apostles phrase, commendatorie letters, written, not with inke, but with the Spirit. Thus saith the Son of God. Not by spirituall regeneration, as all the chil∣dren of promise are the sonnes of God, but by eternall generation: not by grace of adoption, but by nature. Who hath eyes like a flame of fire, and feet like fine brasse. Eyes like a flame of fire, piercing through the thickest darknesse; feete like brasse, to support his Chuch, and stamp to pouder whatsoever riseth up against it; like fine brasse, pure and no way defiled by walking through the midst of the golden candlestickes. Wheresoever he walkes he maketh it holy ground. Quicquid calcaverit hic rosa fiet. There are three sorts of members in holy Scripture attributed to our head Christ Jesus: 1 Naturall. 2 Mysticall. 3 Metaphoricall.
Naturall hee hath, as perfect man. Mysticall, as head of the Church. Metaphoricall, as God. By these members wee may divide all the learned Commentatours ex∣positions. They who follow the naturall or literall construction of the words, apply this description to the members of Christs glorified body in Heaven, which shine like flaming fire, or metall glowing in a furnace. But Lyra and Carthusian have an eye to Christ his mysticall eyes, viz. Bishops and Pastours, who are the over-seers of Christ his flocke, resembling fire in the heat of their zeale and light of their knowledge, whereby they di∣rect the feet of Christ, that is, in their understanding; his inferiour members on earth likened to fine brasse, to set forth the purity of their conversation; and described burning in a furnace, to expresse their fiery tryall by martyr∣dome. Alcasar by the feet of fine brasse understandeth the Preachers of the Word, whom Christ sendeth into all parts to carry the Gospel. Those feet whichEsay 52.7. & Rom. 10.15. How beautifull are the feet of them that preach the Go∣spel of peace? Esay calleth beautifull, Saint John here compareth to the finest brasse; whichBeda in A∣poc. Pedes sunt Christiani in fine seculi, qui similes erunt orichalcho, quod est aes per ignem & plura medica∣mina perdu∣ctum ad auri colorem, sic illi per acerbis∣simas persecu∣tiones exerce∣buntur, & per∣ducentur ad plenam chari∣tatis fulgorem. Beda and Haimo will have to bee copper, rendring the Greeke  not the most resplendent brasse, such as was digged out of Mount Libanus, but Orichalchum, that is, copper: and thus they worke it to their purpose. As brasse the matter of copper, by the force of fire and strong waters and powders receiveth the tincture of gold; so (say they) the Christians that shall stand last upon the earth, termed in that respect Christs feet, shall by many exercises of their patience and fiery tryalls of their faith, be purified and refined, and changed into precious metall, and become golden members of a golden head. I doe not utterly reject this interpretation of the mysticall eyes and feet of Christ, nor the former of the naturall members of his glorified body, be∣cause they carry a faire shew and goodly lustre with them: yet I more en∣cline to the third opinion, which referreth them to the attributes of God. For (me thinkes) I see in the fiery eyes the perfection of Christ his know∣ledge, to which nothing can bee darke or obscure; as also his vigilant zeale over his Church, and the fiercenesse of his wrath against the enemies there∣of. Bullenger conceiveth our Saviour to be pourtrayed by the Spirit with eyes like a flame of fire, because hee enlighteneth the eyes of the godly: but Meyerus, because he suddenly consumeth the wicked; both the knowne pro∣perties of fire: for in flaming fire there is both cleare light and intensive heat. The light is an embleme of his piercing sight, the heat of his bur∣ning wrath. Where the eye is lightsome, and the object exposed to it, the eye must needs apprehend it: but the Sonne of Gods eyes are most light∣some, nay rather light it selfe, in which there is no darknesse, andHeb. 4 13. all things lye open and naked before him: yea, theApoc. 2.23. heart and the reines which he search∣eth. In Courts of humane justice, thoughts and intentions and first moti∣ons to evill beare no actions, because they come not within the walke of mans justice; but it will not be so at Christs Tribunall, where the secrets of all hearts shall be opened. Let no man then hope by power, or fraud, or bribes to smother the truth, or bleare the eyes of the Judge of all flesh. For his eyes, like flames of fire, dispell all darknesse, and carry a bright light before them. Let not the adulterer watch for the twi-light, and when hee
hath met with his wanton Dalila, carry her into the inmost roomes, and locke doore upon doore, and then take his fill of love, saying, The shadow of the night, and the privacy of the roome shall conceale mee. For though none else be by, and all the lights be put out, yet he is seen, and the Sonne of God is by him with eyes like a flaming fire. Let not the Projector pre∣tend the publike good, when he intends nothing but to robbe the rich, and cheate the poore. Let not the cunning Papist under colour of decent orna∣ments of the Church, bring in Images and Idols; under colour of comme∣moration of the deceased, bring in invocation of Saints departed; under co∣lour of extolling charity, bring in the merit of workes; under colour of an Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy, endeavour by degrees to bring in Papall tyran∣ny: for the Sonne of God with his eies like flaming fire seeth the thin wire, and fine threed, by which he would draw in Popery. Now, as the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour shines, so his wrath sparkles in these eyes. When the heart is enflamed with rage, the eies are red andHom. Il. . Virg Georg. 3. Flammantia lumina tor∣quens. & Aen. l. 7. De alecto flammea tor∣quet lumina. fiery, whereofAristot. prob. sect. 31. Aristotle in his Problemes yeelds this reason, Quia ad partem violatam ascendit calor, because the eyes are most offended at the presence of the object, which is hatefull unto us; and therefore nature sends the beate thither, to arme that part with revenge. If Christs eies be like flaming fire, let the heart of all presumptuous sinners melt like waxe before him. Let none gather too farre upon his titles of the Lambe of God, and Prince of peace, and Saviour of the world. For as he is the Lambe of God, so he is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah: as he is the Prince of peace, so hee is the Lord of Hosts: as he is the Saviour of all, especially the Elect, so he is the Judge of quicke and dead: and here he is brought in by Saint John with fire in his eyes to consume, and a sword in his mouth to smite, and brasse in his feet to stamp his enemies to powder. And his feet like fine brasse. Some of the Interpreters demand, why brasse is here preferred to gold? and they yeeld this reason, because brasse is a stronger and harder metall, and the purpose of the Holy Ghost was to represent not only the glory of Christ in the splendour of this metall, but also his power in the strength and solidity thereof. Now gold is a soft and bowing metall, not so apt to represent Christ his invincible power; and therefore here it is said, that his feet were like fine brasse, not burnished gold. The Heathen attributed to their gods feet of a heavier and baser me∣tall, to wit, of lead; whence grew that Proverb among them, That God had leaden feet, butEras. Adag. iron hands: in which their meaning was, that God procee∣deth slowly to the punishment of wicked men, but when hee overtakes them, payes them home; tarditatem supplicii gravitate compensans: but our Saviour, you see in my Text, hath feet of a quicker, stronger, and more pre∣cious metall, of finest brasse, to support his Church, and to knocke and tread downe whatsoever exalteth it selfe against his truth and kingdome. Now I marvell not that SaintMat. 3.11. John thought not himselfe worthy to unloose Christ his shooe latchet, who hath such precious and beautifull feet, resem∣bling fine brasse glowing in a furnace, on whichIn Apoc. c. 1. Dominus pur∣gatissimos ha∣bet pedes, om∣nem calcat im∣pietatem, om∣nem absumit haereticam pra∣vitatem, & vi∣tam impuram. Bullenger engraveth this posie, Our Lord hath most cleane and pure feet, wherewith he tramples on Sa∣tan, he treads downe all impiety, and burneth up all heresie and impurity as hee walketh in the midst of the seven golden Candlestickes. But I may insist no
longer upon these brasen feet of our Saviour, I must haste to that which followeth. I know, that is, I approve. Gods knowledge of any thing in the Scrip∣ture phrase often implyeth his approbation, as Psal. 1. v. ult. As on the con∣trary, those whom hee condemnes hee is said not to know:Mat. 7.23. Depart from mee, I know you not, ye that worke iniquity. I know you not, that is, I acknow∣ledge you not, or take no speciall notice of you. God doth not willingly know any thing but that which is good; whereas on the contrary, most men by their good will will know no good by any, but all the evill they can: like flies they light no where but upon the scarres and sores of their brethren, and after the manner of horse-leaches they greedily sucke out their corrupt bloud. Whereas they might gather many sweet flowers in the Spouse her garden, they cull out nothing but weeds; much like the co∣vetous Vintner, who sold abroad all his best wine, and kept the worst for his house; and being asked of one who saw him walking in his cellar what he was then adoing, answered,Sphinx Phi∣losophica. c. In bonorum copia malum quaero. In abundance and store of good I seeke for bad. I would wee had not just cause to renew the complaint of Gregorie Nazianzen; The onely godlinesse we glory in, is to find out somewhat where∣by we may judge others to be ungodly: the onely vertue is to finde vice in o∣thers, as if to soile others were the readiest meanes to cleare our selves. To convict us of this malevolent disposition I need no other proofe than the use of the verbe animadverto in Latine, and marke in English: for animad∣vertere in aliquem signifieth to censure, or punish; and to shew that wee marke nothing so much as mens vices and deformities, the very word mark in English, without any epithet added unto it, signifieth a deformity: as when wee say, Such an one is a markt man; and, Take heed of those whom God hath marked. As venemous Serpents are nourished with poysonous roots and herbs, so men of corrupt minds greedily feed upon other mens corruptions, and desire to know nothing more than the wants and infirmi∣ties of their brethren; herein direct contrary to the goodnesse of God, who is here said to know that onely which he knoweth to be good and ap∣proveth; as the opposition betweene this sentence and that which follow∣eth (Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee) maketh it manifest. I know then, that is, I like, or I approve of Thy workes, and charity, and service, and faith, and patience. And thy workes, that is, thy workes begun, and thy workes ended; the workes of thy faith, and the workes of thy calling; thy workes at the first, and thy workes at the last. I commend thee for thy love of mee, and thy service to me, and thy faith in me, and thy patience for me, and thy proficiency in all these, which most evidently appeares by this, That thy last workes are more than the first. Take we here by the way an infallible note of a true Christian, which is growth in grace and godlinesse: he is like Vespasian in the Poet, melior pejore aevo, better in his worser age. He never standeth at a stay, butPsal. 84.7. goeth on from strength to strength: like the trees planted in the house of the Lord, theyPsal. 92.14. still bring forth more fruit in their age. As theJohn 2.10. water-pots of stone, which our Saviour filled with wine by miracle, yeelded the best wine at the last; Thou hast kept the good wine even till now: and as thePro. 14.18. But the path of the just is a the shining light that shineth more and more untill the per∣ect day. light of the Sun shineth more and more till it
be perfect day: as the branches of the true vine, bearing fruit in Christ, are purged and pruned by the Father, that they may bring forth more fruit.John 15.2. Here∣in the supernaturall motions of the Spirit resemble all naturall motions, which, as the Philosopher teacheth us, are velociores in fine quam in princi∣pio, swifter in the end than in the beginning. Of all the proper markes of the elect children of God this is the most certaine, and therefore St.Phil. 3.13, 14. Paul instanceth in it onely: This one thing I doe, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before. I presse towards the mark for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. And St.2 Pet. 3.18. Peter clo∣seth with it, as the upshot of all: Ye therefore, beloved, beware lest ye fall from your own stedfastnesse: but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. It is not so in the spiritual as in the corporall augmenta∣tion: for the body groweth, according to all dimensions, but to a certain age; but the soule may & must grow in spiritual graces till the houre of death: and the reason of the difference is, because the aetas consistentiae of our body is in this life, but of our soul in the life to come. Here the body arriveth to the  highest pitch of perfection, but the soule arriveth not to hers til we come to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to theHeb. 12.23. Church of the first borne, and to the spirits of just men made perfect. O that our blessed Redeemer had here made an end of his letter, and sealed up all the Angels praises with this sweet close! what an admirable president should we have had of a perfect Pastour? what joy should have beene in the presence of the Angels for the unspotted integrity and absolute perfection of this Angell? But because (as St.Ep. ad ust. Apud Deum nihil tantum suave placet ni∣si quod habet in se aliquid mor∣dacis veritatis. Jerome acutely observeth) that there was no use of hony in the sacrifices of the old law, be∣cause nothing pleaseth God which is onely sweet, and hath not in it somewhat of biting truth; therefore after the sweet insinuation, I know, &c. there fol∣loweth a sharpe reprehension, there is a Notwithstanding that standeth in this Angels light, and obscureth the lustre of all his former vertues. Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee. Origen handling those word,Cant. 1.5. Nigra sum, sed formosa, I am blacke, but comely, draweth the face and lineaments of Christs Spouse, if I may so speake, with a blacke coale:Orig. in Cant. hom. 1. Quaeri∣mus quomodo nigra & sine candore sit pul∣chra? poeniten∣tiam egit a pec∣catis, speciem ei largita est con∣versio, nigra est propter antiqua peccata, sed propter poeni∣tentiam habet aliquid quasi Aethiopici de∣coris. How (saith he) can she be faire that is all blacke? I answer, she hath repented her of her sinnes, and her repentance hath given her beautie, but such as may be in a Negro or Blackmoore. Philosophie teacheth that there is no pure metall to be found in the Mines of the earth, nor unmixed element in the world. What speak I of the earth? the starres of the skie are not cleane, nor the Angels of heaven pure in Gods eyes: (Job 25.5. Behold even to the moone, and it shineth not, yea the starres are not pure in his sight.) how much lesse sinfull man, whose conception is lust, and birth shame, and life frailty, and death corruption? After St. Austine had blazoned his mothers vertues, as Christ doth here the Angels, he presently dasheth them all through with a blacke line,Aug. confes. l. 9. c. 13. Attamen vae laudibili vitae hominum, si remotâ miserecordiâ discutias eum, Woe be to the most righteous upon earth, if God deale with them in strict justice.Aug. l. 10. c. 28. Conten∣dunt laetitiae meae flendae cum laetandis moeroribus, & ex qua parte stet victoria nescio. hei mihi, Domine miserere mei. Contendunt moerores mei mali cum gaudiis bonis, & ex qua parte stet victoria nescio: hei mihi, Domine miserere mei. Ecce, vulnera mea non obscondo, medicus es, aeger sum; misericors es, miser sum. As for me (saith that humble Saint) I confesse my sinnes to thy glory, but my owne shame: my sinfull delights contend with my godly sor∣rowes, and on whether side standeth the victorie I know not: woe is me, Lord
have mercy upon me. Againe, my ungodly sorrowes contend with my holy joyes, and on which side standeth the victorie I know not: woe is me, Lord have mer∣cy on me. Behold, I hide not my wounds: thou art a Physician, I am sicke; thou art a Surgeon, I am thy Patient; thou art pitifull, I am in miserie. If the light be darknesse, how great is the darknesse? If our righteousnesse be as menstruous clouts (Esay 64.6.) what are our monstrous sinnes? Yet the Pro∣phet saith not that the covers of our sinnes, but the robes of our righte∣ousnesse are as filthy rags. WhereuponOrigen. in ep. ad Rom. c. 3. Quis vel super justitia uá glo∣riabitur, cum audiat Deum per Prophetam dicentem, quia omnis iustitia vestra sicut pan∣nus menstruatae Origen groundeth that question, which may gravell all those that build upon the sinking sands of their owne merits: Who dare brag of his righteousnesse, when he heareth God saying by his Prophet, All our righteousnesse is as filthy rags? Surely Pope Gregorie was no Papist, at least in this point: for he prizeth the best endeavours of grace in us at a lower rate than Luther or Calvin; they say our purest coyne is allayed with some quantity of baser metall, he, that it is no better than drosse:Greg. mor. l. 9. c. 11. Omnis humana iustitia injustitia esse convincitu, si district judice∣tur. All humane justice (saith he) examined according to Gods strict justice, is inju∣stice. Therefore if we say or thinke God hath nothing against us, he hath much against us for so saying or thinking. ForPsal. 19.12. who knoweth how oft he of∣fendeth? O cleanse thou us all from our secret faults. Had we arrived to the perfection of this Angel in my text, and could exhibite letters testimoniall signed by our Saviour, such as this Angel of Thyatira might; yet were it not safe to capitulate with God: notwithstanding all our vertues and graces he hath somewhat against us, either for sinnes of omission, or sinnes of commission, or at least sinnes of permission. I have somewhat against thee, that thou sufferest The woman, .Com. in Apoc. Ambrosius Ansbertus, Richell, Dionysius, Carthusi∣anus, and Hugo Cardinalis, translate the word in the Originall, uxorem, thy wife: which is the rather worth the noting in these Popish Interpreters, who yet condemne Priests marriage. Doubtlesse this Angel was a good Bishop, for he is highly commended by our Saviour; yet had he his wife by their confession. Why therefore may not sacred persons enter into the sacred bands of matrimony? Is it because, as Pope Sirycius, and after him Cardinall Bellarmine, bear us in hand, conjugall acts and matrimoniall duties stand not with the sanctity of the Priests function? Now verily this is a strange thing, that marriage, according to the doctrine of their Church, is a Sacrament conferring grace, and yet a disparagement to the most sacred function: marriage is a holy Sacrament, and yet Priests are bound by a Sa∣crament (that is, an oath) never to receive it: marriage was instituted in Pa∣radise, in the state of mans innocencie, when the image of God, which the Apostle interpreteth to be holinesse and righteousnesse, shined most bright∣ly in him, and yet it is a cloud, nay, a blurre to the most holy calling: marri∣age was appointed by God as a speciall remedie against fornication and all uncleannesse, and yet is an impeachment to holinesse. The Aaronical Priest∣hood by Gods owne order was to be continued in the line of Aaron by ge∣neration, not election; and yet marriage cannot stand with the holinesse of Priesthood. Who of the Patriarkes before the Flood was holier than Enoch, who walked with God, and was translated, that he should not see death? of the Prophets under the Law, than Ezekiel? of the Apostles, than St. Peter and Philip? and yet of Enoch we read, thatGen. 5.22. he begat sonnes
and daughters: and SaintChrysost. in Gen. homil. 21. , &c. Chrysostome bids us take speciall notice of it, that the Holy Ghost saith in the same Verse, he walked with God, and beg at sonnes and daughters, to teach us that the bonds of matrimony are no such fet∣ters, that they hinder us from walking with God. EzekielsEzek 24.16. wife is mentio∣ned in his prophecy, and PetersMat. 12.14. wives mother in the Gospel, and PhilipsActs 21 9. daughters that prophesied in the Acts: with whose examplesClem. strom. l. 3. p. 327. 'H . Clemens Alexandrinus mightily confoundeth, and convinceth those ancient Here∣tickes, the fore-runners of our Papists, who disparaged this holy ordinance of God: What, saith hee, will they blame the Apostles themselves? For Peter and Philip begat children; Philip also gave his daughters in marriage. Nei∣ther can our adversaries evade these instances, by saying that the Apostles indeed had wives before they were ordained Priests, but after they entred into that holy calling, forsooke them, and had no more commerce with them. ForClem. strom. l. 7 p. 529. Arunt B. Pe∣trum cum vi∣disset uxorem suam duci ad mortem, no∣mine quoque compellâsse, ac dixisse, Heus tu, memento Domini. Clemens informeth us, that Saint Peters wife kept with him till her death, and that when he saw her led to martyrdome, he called to her by name, and encouraged her, saying, Remember the Lord. Howbeit the major part of the Expositors take not Jezebel here for the Bishops wife, but a disciple of the Nicolaitans, who is here named Je∣zebel, because shee resembled Jezebel especially in three particulars. 1. As Jezebel brought amongst the Israelites the false worship of the Idoll Baal; so this woman laboured to bring into this Church of Thyatira, Idolatry and other pernitious errours in doctrine and practice. 2.2 Kin. 9 22. Jezebel was given to fornication, for which vice the Holy Ghost brandeth this woman also. 3. Jezebel was a woman of authority, and by her place and dignity did countenance and maintaine▪ Idolatry; and so it is likely that this was a wo∣man of some place and ranke, which she abused to countenance wicked opi∣nions, and seduce Gods servants.Hieron. de nom. Heb. Jezebel in the Hebrew signifieth fluxum sanguinis, or stirquilinium, an issue of bloud or doung; both which were ve∣rified in the wife of Ahab, whose abominable life and fearfull death yee may see set forth in lively colours in the booke of2 Kin. 9.33. ad finem. They threw her downe, and some of her bloud was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses, and he trod her under foot. & Ver. 37. The carkeis of Je∣zebel was as doung upon the face of the field. Kings, to breed in all men and women a detestation of the one, by the shame and horrour of the other. A lamentable spectacle (deare Christians) to see the daughter and wife of a King trampled under foot in the dirt, and the dogges tearing her flesh, and licking up her bloud. Shee who spent so much time in dressing and tricking up her selfe at the window, is throwne downe headlong out of that window: shee that looked so high, falls full low, and is trod under foot by her servant: shee who spilt Naboths innocent bloud in Jezreel, expiateth the place with her owne bloud: that face, on which shee a little before had laid costly colours and oyntments, is now besmeared with dirt, and stained with her owne bloud: that flesh of hers which she pampered with all kindes of delicious meates, is now cast to dogges. Let them heare this and feare who weare Jezebels colours, and tread in her steps; who defile themselves with corporall or spirituall fornication; who either idolatrize or idolize, worship painted images, or make them∣selves such. Jezebel was the first we reade of, that tooke the pensill out of the hand of her Maker, endeavouring to mend his workmanship; and what became of her you heard but now. And howsoever some of late, as they
have sowed pillowes under mens elbowes, so have tempered colours also for women, and made apologies for painting, yet all the ancient Fathers con∣demne it as a foule sinne. SaintCyp. de hab. virg. Nonne metuis oro quae talis es, ne cum resurrecti∣onis dies vene∣rit, artifx tu∣us te non re∣cognoscat? ad sua praemia & promissa veni∣entem exclu∣dat, & remo∣veat, increpans vigore censoris & judicis: opus hoc meum non est, nec haec imago nostra est, cutem fal∣so medicami∣ne polluisti, crinem adul∣tero colore mutásti, Deum videre non po∣teris, cùm ocu∣li tibi non sint quos Deus fe∣cit, sed quos Diabolus infe∣cit. Cyprian thus schooles a young Jezebel in his dayes: Art not thou afraid, saith hee, that plaisterest thy face, and pain∣test thy body, lest at the day of judgement thy Maker will not know thee? but when thou pressest among the rest to receive the promised rewards to his ser∣vants, will put thee backe, saying: Who art thou? what face doe I see? this is none of my workmanship, I never drew this feature. SaintJerom. ep. ad Furiam. Quid facit in facie Christianae purpurissa & cerussa? fo∣menta libidi∣num, impudi∣cae mentis in∣ditia? quo∣modo flere po¦test pro pecca∣tis suis, quae lachrymis cu∣tem nudat, & sulcos ducit in facie? quâ fi∣duciâ erigat ad Deum vultus, quos conditor non agnoscat? Jerome takes the like up in his time as sharply: What makes paint and complexion on the face of a Christian? it is no other than the fire of youth, the fuell of lust, the evi∣dence of an unchaste minde: How can shee weep for her sinnes, for feare of wa∣shing away her paint, and making furrowes in her face? How dare shee looke her Maker in the face, who hath defaced his image in her selfe? But because I see it will be to no purpose, to draw this their sinne of painting in its pro∣per colours before them (for they cannot blush) I therefore leave them, and come to her in my Text Which calleth her selfe a Prophetesse. As Novatus the Schismaticke or∣dained himselfe a Bishop, so Jezebel the Nicolait annointed (or rather painted her selfe) a Prophetesse, that by this meanes shee might teach more freely, and perswade more powerfully. The true Prophets of God recei∣ved their name and calling from God, and wonderfully confirmed the sin∣cerity of their doctrine by the truth of their miracles, and the truth of their miracles by the holinesse of their doctrine. So many tongues as they spake with, with so many testimonies; so many miracles as they wrought, with so many hands they signed and sealed their calling: but deceivers and impostors grace themselves with high and strange titles, and glorious names, to bleare the eyes of the simple. So Psaphon called himselfe, and taught the birds to call him, magnus deusRun. Com∣ment. in Aristot. Rhet. MS. Psaphon, great god Psaphon. Theudas said he was some great one. Simon Magus stiled himselfe the great power of God, and gave it out among his scholars, That hee delivered the Law to Moses in Mount Sinai in the person of God the Father, and in the reigne of Tiberius appeared in the likenesse of the sonne of man, and on the day of Pentecost came downe upon the Apostles in the similitude of cloven tongues. Montanus arrogated to himself the title of Paracletus, the comforter, and to his three minions, Priscilla, Maximilla, and Quintilla, the name of Pro∣phetesses.Manes . Manes bare himselfe as if hee were an Apostle immediately sent from Christ; and his followers would be thought to be termed Ma∣nichei, not from their mad master, but , but because they poured manna out of their mouthes. The great Seducer of the Jewes, who in Theodosius time drew thousands after him into the sea and there drow∣ned them, perswaded his followers that he was Moses: and the abomina∣tion of the Turkes Mahomet calleth himselfe Gods great Prophet.Plin. nat. hist. lib. 1. Inscrip∣tionis apud Graecos mira foelicitas favus, Cornucopia, ut vel lactis gallinacei sperare possis haustu, Musae, Pandectae, in∣scriptiones propter quas vadimonium deseri possit, at cum intraveris dii deaeque quam nihil in medio in∣venies. Pliny derideth the vanity of the Greekes in this kinde, who usually set golden titles on leaden Treatises. And Heretickes alwayes, like Mountebankes, set out their drugs with magnificent words. Nestorius, though he were a condem∣ned
Hereticke, yet covered himselfe with the vaile of a true Professour, . Ebion, though he held with the Samaritans, yet would be held a Christian. The Turkes at this day, though it appeares out of all stories that they descended from Hagar, yet assume to themselves the name of Saracens. The Donatist Schismatickes impropriate to their conventi∣cles the name of the true Church. And no marvell that the Salmonian off∣spring of Ignatius Loyola christen themselves Jesuits, sith the Prince of darknesse not only usurpeth the name, but also taketh upon him the forme of an2 Cor. 11.14. Angel of light. It is a silly shift of a bankrupt disputant in the schooles to argue a vocibus ad res, from the bare name of things to their nature: and yet Bristow in his motives, and Cardinall Bellarmine in his booke of the notes of the Church, and other of the Pope his stoutest Champions, fight against us with this festraw, We are (say they) sirnamed Catholikes, there∣fore we are so. By this kind of argument Pope Alexander the sixt his ince∣stuous daughter might prove her selfe to be a chaste matron, because she was called Lucrece. —Lucrecia nomine, sed re Thais; Alexandri filia, sponsa, nurus. And Philemon his theevish servant might prove himselfe to be honest, be∣cause his name was Onesimus: and the three Ptolomies,, pro∣fitabl. whereof the first killed his Father, and the second his Mother, and the third his Brother, might prove themselves to be full of naturall affection, because the one was sirnamedA lover of his Father. Philopater, the otherA lover of his Mother. Philometor, the thirdA lover of his Brother. Philodelphus. Were mens names alwayes correspondent to their nature,Eras. apoph. in Philip. Philip of Macedon had lost a witty jest, which he brake upon two brothers, Hecaterus, and Am∣photerus, thus inverting their names, , He whose name is either of the two deserveth to be called both, because hee is worth both; and he whose name is both shall be called neither, because he is of no worth at all. But to throw away foyles, and come to the sharpe: Will they thus argue in good earnest, Protestants are called Sectaries or Schismatickes, and Pa∣pists Catholikes, therefore they are so? Will they condemne the Primi∣tive Christians for Atheists, because the heathen usually so termed them, in regard they had no faith in their gods? Will they brand St. Paul for an Heretick, or the Truth himself for a Seducer, because ignorance and malice fastened these calumnies and blasphemies upon them? Protestants are ter∣med Heretickes by Papists, and are not Papists also by Protestants? what gaine then the Papists hereby? Papists are termed Catholikes; I would know by whom? If by any Protestant, they know well it is but by a Sar∣casme, or Ironie; as Alexander was called a god by the Lacedaemonians, Quoniam Alexander vult esse deus, sit deus. Yea, but they are so stiled by all that adhere to the Church of Rome: and were not the Arrians called Catholikes by Arrians? the Nestorians Or∣thodoxe by Nestorians? the Novatians the best Christians by Novati∣ans? the Donatists sole members of the Church by Donatists? the most impure Sect of Anabaptists the Family of love by those of their owne cut?
If this argument may passe for currant; Papists terme themselves Catho∣likes, therefore they are so: what exception can be taken against these and the like? The Turkes call themselves Saracens, therefore they are the off∣spring of Sarah: they of Satans Synagogue call themselvesApoc. 3.9. Jewes, there∣fore they are Jewes indeed: the Angel of Sardis had a name that heApoc. 3.1. lived, therefore he was not dead: the Angel ofApoc. 3.17. Laodicea said he was rich, and nee∣ded nothing, therfore he was not wretched, & miserable, and poor, & blind, and naked: Jezebel called her selfe a Prophetesse, therefore she was so indeed. Without question Jezebel set some fairer colour upon the matter than this, else she could never have dazled the eyes of Gods servants: well she might offer to teach in the Church under this pretence, which yet S. Paul expresse∣ly forbids a1 Cor. 14.34. woman to doe; but certainely she could never have foyled any servant of God with so weake an argument, grounded upon a bare title assumed by her selfe: yet the Spirit saith, that she not onely taught, but pre∣vailed also with some, and seduced them. To teach and seduce my servants. I doubt not but at the reading of these words your thoughts trouble you, and you begin to question whether this doctrine is not a seduction, to teach that any of Gods servants can be seduced. Can any elect child of God fall from grace? Is it possible to plucke any of Christs members from his body? Can the Sun-beames by any winde or tempest be stirred out of their place?1 John 2.19. Doth not St. John dispute strong∣ly? They went away from us, because they were not of us: for if they had beene of us, they would not have departed from us. Is not St.Cypr. de sim∣plic. Praelat. Triticum non rapit ventu, nec arborem solidâ radice fundatam pro∣cella subvertit, inanes paleae tempestate ja∣ctantur, invali∣dae arbores tur∣binis incursione evertuntur. Cyprians ob∣servation as true as it is elegant? The winde bloweth not away the corne, nei∣ther is a tree that hath taken a deepe root in the earth overthrowne in a tem∣pest: it is but chaffe which the winde scattereth abroad, and they are hol∣low and rotten trees, that are blowne downe in a tempest. To dispell all mists of ambiguity, and cleare the truth in this point, I must acquaint you with two sorts of Christs servants, or retainers at least; some weare his cloth and cognizance, but doe him little or no service, others per∣form faithful service unto him: some give him their names only, others their hearts also: some professe outwardly that they are Christians, but have un∣beleeving hearts: others are within that they professe without: some are called onely to the knowledge of the truth, others are chosen also to be heires of salvation. Of these latter our Saviour speakes in St. John;Joh. 10.27, 28 My sheepe heare my voyce, and I know them, and they follow me, and I will give unto them eternall life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man plucke them out of my hands. But of the former the words of my text seeme to bee meant. Howbeit, because the Discerner of all hearts calleth them his servants, saying, to seduce my servants; and it is not likely that he would grace hy∣pocrites with so honourable an appellation: wee may yeeld somewhat more in this point, and without prejudice to the truth acknowledge, that the true servants of God, and ministers also of Christ Jesus, may be sometimes seduced out of the right way, but not farre, I am sure not irrevocably. The difference betweene them and others in this respect, is like that which theCic. tusc. 1. Boni in erto∣rem sicut aes Corinthium in aeruginem, & incidunt rariùs & facilius re∣vocantur. Oratour observeth betweene the Corinthian and common brasse: as the brasse of Corinth is longer ere it rust, and when it is rustie is sooner scowred,
and more easily recovers the former brightnesse than other brasse; so good men are hardlier withdrawne from the true faith, and more ea∣sily reclaimed from their errours, than those who beare no sincere love to the truth, but are wedded to their owne opinions whatsoever they are, and oftentimes blinded by obstinately setting their eyes against the bright beames of the Word. Out of the Arke of Noah, which was a type of the Church, there flew twoGen. 8.7. birds, a Raven and a Dove; the Raven after hee had taken his flight returned not againe, but the Dove came backe with an Olive branch in her bill. The Dove (saith SaintCypr. adver. Nvit. Prosp l. de prom. c. 7. Cyprian) represented the seduced Catholike, who after hee is gone out of the Church, never findeth rest till hee returne backe with an O∣live branch of peace in his mouth, and bee reconciled to the Church: But the Raven is the obstinate Hereticke, who leaveth the Church with a purpose never to returne to her againe. And many such Ravens have beene of late let flye out of the Arke, which never returne againe; or if they returne, it is to prey upon the sicke and weake members of our Church, and to picke out the eyes of her dearest children: and I pray God wee may never have cause to renew the Poets com∣plaint, Dat veniam corvis, vexat censura columbas. To commit fornication. Fornication, asLyra in Apoc. c. 2. Fornicatio est quadruplex, in nimo, simu∣lierem concu∣piscs, in actu, in cultu Idolo∣rum, in amore terrenorum. Lyranus harpeth upon the word, is committed foure manner of wayes. 1. By the impure lust of the heart. 2. By the uncleane act of the body. 3. By the religious worship of Images or Idols. 4. By the immoderate love of earthly vanities. For when the soule turneth away from God, and setteth her love wholly upon vile and base creatures, so farre below her, that God hath placed them under her feet; what doth shee but like a Lady of noble descent, married to a Prince, which disloyally leaveth his bed, and ma∣keth love to the groome of her chamber? Certainely this is sordidum adulterium, not onely filthy, but base adultery. Howbeit, I take it, this was not the staine of the Church of Thy∣atira; but either fornication properly so called, which is corporall I∣dolatry; or idolatry, which is spirituall fornication. For idolatry de∣fileth the Spirit, as adultery polluteth the flsh: idolatry provoketh God, as adultery doth man to jealousie: as adultery is a just cause of separation betweene man and his wife, so idolatry maketh a breach be∣twixt God and the soule, and causeth in the end a divorce: by rea∣son of which separation for disloyalty and unfaithfulnesse, SaintCypr. de hab. virg. Prius vi∣dus quam nuptas, non mariti, sed Christi adulte∣ras. Cy∣prian wittily tearmeth certaine virgins widowes before they were mar∣ried wives, yea and adulteresses too; not to their husbands, (which they had not) but to Christ, to whom they had plighted their troth. And looke how a jealous husband would bee transported with passi∣on, if hee should finde his wife embracing a stranger in bed; so doth
the wrath of God burne like fire, and his jealousie breake out like a bright flame against such as Pigmalion-like entertaine an Idoll for him in the bed of their soule, and commit fornication with it. To commit fornication, and to eat meat sacrificed unto Idols. There is so neare affinity betwixt carnall and spirituall fornication, that few defile their soules with the one, but are defiled in body with the o∣ther; as Jezebels scholars here, who by eating meat sacrificed unto Idols, were provoked to corporall uncleannesse. One sinne, as it breedeth, so it feedeth another: and as blindnesse of eyes was inflicted upon Elymas for his blindnesse of heart, so God in his secret and just judgement here pu∣nished the Nicolaits spirituall with corporall fornication; that as they pro∣voked him to jealousie by familiarly and freely conversing with Idolaters, so they were provoked to jealousie by their wives keeping company with adulterers. Touching eating meats sacrificed unto Idols, which the Spirit in this place, and Saint1 Cor. 10.20. Paul, and all theActs 15.20. Apostles in their decretall Epistle so strictly forbid, you are to understand that the Christians in the Primi∣tive Church, in respect of their acquaintance and alliance with the hea∣then that dwelt among them, did not sticke, when they were invited by them, to goe to their banquets and feasts, which they kept in the Temples of their Idols, when they sacrificed unto them, and there they spent the remainder of such cates and wines as had beene offered to their Paynim gods. The pretence which the Christians had for their resorting to these feasts was this, that they knew the Idoll was nothing, and therefore, giving thankes to God for his creatures, they did eat of all things without any scruple of conscience, howsoever they had beene used, and to whomsoever they had beene offered. This our Saviour here reproveth the Thyatirians for, and St. Paul the Corinthians in the place above alled∣ged; shewing, that though the Idoll was nothing in it selfe, yet sith the Gentiles did offer such things as were served-in at their Idols feast, not to God but to Divels, the Christians could not sit at the same tables with them, rejoycing and feasting in the names of them, but they must be parta∣kers of their idolatry. The maine argument he useth may bee thus reduced to forme. They that eat of things offered unto Idols are partakers of the Divels table, and are as it were in messe with him: But none of Gods family may table with the Divell; therefore all Christians ought to make conscience of accepting the heathens invitation to such feasts, wherein they were to feed upon the Devils reliques. Now that the servants of God may not meddle or make with the Divell or any of his instruments, needs no proofe at all.2 Cor. 6.14. For what Communion hath light with darkenesse? or what fellowship hath Christ with Belial? And that they that keepe gaudy dayes for the Divell, and make merry with his reliques, have fellowship with him, the Apostle sheweth by the like examples. They that eat of the sacramentall bread have their communion with Christ, they that eat of the legall sacrifices are partakers of the Altar; even so they that eat things offered unto Idols divide commons as it were with the Dvell. Thus have I glanced at all the parts of this Scripture; but my principall
aime was from the beginning at Jezebel, set as a faire or rather foule marke in the midst of this verse (I have somewhat against thee, that thou sufferest Jezebel.) It is not onely evill to doe, but also to suffer evill, when it is in in our power to hinder it; as I proved heretofore at large by arguments drawne 1. From the Law, forbidding to plow with an Oxe and an Asse, and pu∣nishing Idolaters with death. 2. From the Gospell, denying the service of two Masters, and interdi∣cting all fellowship and communion of light with darknesse, or Christ with Belial. 3. From the Spirits bill of enditement, framed against the Angels of Pergamus and Thyatira, for tolerating the Nicolaitans. 4 From Gods threatning to cut off all such as sweare by him, and by Mal∣chim. 5 From the Kings command in the parable, to compell all the guests that were bid to come to his marriage feast. 6. From the imputation which is laid by the Spirit upon many Kings of Israel and Judah, for not taking away the high places. 7. From the examples of Asa, Josiah, Ezechiah, Nebuchadnezzar, Con∣stantine, Jovian, Theodosius, and other religious Princes, who by se∣vere lawes restrained heresie and idolatry, and constrained the true worship of God. 8. From the verdict and depositions of the ancient Fathers, Tertullian, Cyprian, Jerome, Austine, Leo, Gregory, Clemens Alexandrinus, Epiphanius, and Bernard, who all strengthen the armes of the Magistrate, and sharpen his sword against heretickes. 9 From the lawes of the ancient Grecians, Romanes, and almost all the heathen, who censured some way or other all innovation in religion, and profanation of divine worship. Lastly, from the great danger of heresie, which like a canker soone spreads over the whole body of the Church, and, if it bee not looked into, killeth, and that eternally, thousands of soules, breaketh the bands of nature, and cutteth asunder all sinewes of humane society; putteth enmity, vari∣ance, and implacable discords in families, soweth seeds of sedition in the State, reacheth dagges and daggers to subjects to assacinate the sacred per∣sons of the Lords annointed, layeth traynes in the deepe vaults of dislyall hearts, to blow up Parliaments, and offer whole Kingdomes for an Holo∣caust. It now remaineth that I appeach the Whore of Babylon of Jezeba∣lisme, and discover her filthy abominations, and abominable filthinesse in the face of the sunne. The Spirit here describeth Jezebel by three markes: 1. Imposture, She calleth her selfe a Prophetesse. 2. Impurity, She teacheth to commit fornication. 3. Idolatry, She alloweth eating meat sacrificed unto idols. With these three crimes I dare more confidently charge the Romane
Synagogue, because with a whorish forehead shee seemeth rather to stand upon the justification of them, than the deniall. For among her religious practises shee reckoneth pious frauds, as if shee verily beleeved that which heathen Varro writeth,Expedit fal∣lin religione civitates. That it is expedient for men to be cheated in matter of religion. And hereupon Vincentius Bellovacensis in the life of Saint Do∣minicke, intitles one chapter, De sanctâ ejus hypocrisi, Of his holy hypocrisie: And for impurity, Casa the Archbishop of Beneventum layeth colours of eloquence upon that foule sinne, which God punished in Sodome with fire and brimstone. And for idolatry, Gregory de Valentiâ, the prime of the Schoole-men, professedly pleads for it, and endevours to prove it to bee lawfull out of the words of Saint Peter;1 Pet. 4.3. Greg. de Val. de cult. mag. Quid attinebat ita detrminatè cultus simula∣crorum illici∣tos notar, si omnino nullos simulahrorum cultus licitos esse censuisset? When ye walked in lasciviousnesse, lusts, revellings, banquettings, and unlawfull and abominable idolatries. What need (saith hee) Saint Peter deterre us from unlawfull idolatries, if some kind of idolatry were not lawfull? Good God! Idolatry lawfull, holy hy∣pocrisie, pious frauds, honest sodomy! Did ever Nicolaus of Antiochia, or Je∣zebel of Thyatira set abroach such impure and unsavoury doctrine? did e∣ver the Carpocratians, who let the reines loose to all kinds of lewdnesse and villany, maintaine more damnable positions? But to keepe close to the patterne in my text, and to draw a perfect pi∣cture of the Church of Rome by notes taken from Jezebel. Imposture.First, Jezebel called her selfe a Prophetesse: and doth not the Church of Rome usurpe the same title, and boast of her Propheticke Spirit? If any be ignorant hereof, let him cast but a looke intoL. 4. c. 15. Dodecima nota est lumen propheticum. Bellarmine his booke of the notes of the Church, there shall he see Lumen propheticum, the light of prophesie, drawne out in a faire and goodly character, for the twelfth note of the Romane Church. You see the first marke of Jezebel visible in the Church of Rome: As Jezebel calleth her selfe a Prophetesse, so the Church of Rome arrogateth to her selfe that supernaturall gift. Impurity.The second marke is as foule as the other is faire in shew: She teacheth to commit fornication. I would be loth to cast so foule an aspersion upon the Roman Church, if the ancient Rubrick in the Canon law blushed any thing at these words,Distinct. 34. Qui non habet uxorem loco illius concubi∣nam debet ha∣bere. He that hath not a wife, ought to have a concubine in stead of her: or the Pope his holinesse were ashamed to draw a revenue of many thousand Duckets by the yeere out of somewhat worse than Vespasian his tribute ex lotio. But sith the Marozia of Sergius, the Matildis of Gregory the s venth, the Lucretia of Alexander the sixt, the Magdalena of Leo the tenth, the Constantia of Paul the third, were as infamous as Ovids Corinna; sith ancient Popes have erected stewes, and later take toll of them at this day in Rome,Vid. Wessl Gronig. de in∣dulgent. Avennion, and elsewhere; sith ancienter Popes have dispen∣sed with unnaturall lusts, and the later with incestuous marriages; sith the Riarius of Sixtus the fourth, the Germanus of Julius the second, the Hippo∣lytus of Leo the tenth, and Innocentius de monte of Julius the third, gave but too much cause to Mantuan, and other later Poets to proclaime to the world, Sanctus ager scurris, venerabilis ara cinoedis Servit, honorandae divûm Ganymedibus aedes.

VerilyEspenc. com. in Tit. c. 1. Espenceus had good cause to affirme, That more naugh∣tinesse and filthinesse might bee learned out of Taxa camerae Apostolicae, (whereunto I adde Zanche's de Matrimonio, and other Casuists) than out of all the obscene satyres, and epigrammes of profane Poets. What Christian eares can endure that preface of Pope Gregory,Greg. extrav. de jud. c. 4. De adulterio, & aliis minoribus cri∣minibus, potest Episcopus cum Clericis post poenitentiam dispensare. For adultery and other lesser sinnes the Bishop may dispence with a Priest after penance. But I list not to bring to light other of their works of darknesse; let the night cover her owne shame. I proceed from Jezebels corporall to her spirituall whoredome, wherein the Church of Rome exceedeth her. For Jezebel taught onely that it was lawfull to keepe company, and make merry with Idolaters, and partake of their offerings: but the Church of Rome partaketh with them in their Idoll-worship. For albeit shee pre∣tendeth that shee tendereth no religious service to the Idols of the Hea∣then, the enemies of God, but to the images of Saints, and shrines of Martyrs; this no way cleareth her from spirituall uncleannesse. For it will not be allowed for a good plea in a disloyall wife, to say that she gave no entertainement to any of her husbands enemies, but onely made much of his dearest friends, and admitted them into bed for his sake. The adul∣terie in it selfe is foule, with whomsoever it be committed; and Idol-ser∣vice in it selfe is abominable, to whomsoever it be performed. To pay the debt of conjugall love to any save her husband in a wife is adulterie; and to tender divine honour to any save God is idolatrie. Therefore if wee can bring any good proofe hereof, that the Church of Rome doth this, and a∣voweth the doing of it, we doe her no wrong to call her the great Whore, of whose cup of abominations whosoever drinke become so giddie, that they fall before stockes and stones; like men whose braines are intoxicated, take images and pictures for men and women, bring presents to them, put costly apparell on them, speake to them, embrace and kisse them.Lactan. divin. instit. l. 2. Ado∣rant insensibi∣lia, quisentiunt; irrationabilia, qui sapiunt; ex∣anima qui vi∣vunt; terrena, qui oriuntur è coelo. O sottish folly! the living image of God falleth downe before dumb and dead pictures and statues; men to whom God hath given sense and reason, adore unreasonable and senselesse creatures; they who are capable of wisedome aske counsell of stockes and stones; they who receive their soules from heaven, doe homage, and per∣forme religious service to the vilest and basest creatures on the earth.
O curvae in terra animae, & coelestium inanes. But to draw a formall bill of enditement against the Church of Rome. Whatsoever Church attributeth divine honour to a creature, is guil∣tie of abominable Idolatrie: But the Church of Rome attributeth divine honour to divers crea∣tures; Ergo she is guilty of abominable Idolatry. The proposition of this syllogisme is impregnable; and if it be assaul∣ted, we have anReynold. l. 2. de Idol. Rom. eccl. c. 3. & 9. probat. ex Rom. 1.13. & 2.12.

Whosoever allow the same honour to the Image, and to him whom it representeth, that is to say, to the Image of God and God himselfe, to the Image of Christ and Christ himselfe, they by a necessarie consequent yeeld divine honour to Images, which are creatures: butAlens. 3. p. q. 39. art. ult.

Capreolus,Henric. quod∣lib. 10. q. 6. Idem honor debetur Imagini & ex∣emplari. Henricus, and many other joyntly teach, that the same honour is due to the Image, and to the person represented by it: and particularlySuarez. in p. 3. Thom. Tom. 1. disput. 54. sec. 4, 5. Suarez contendeth, that divine honour is to be gi∣ven to the Images of the Trinitie, by the decrees of the Councell of Trent: therefore the Church of Rome by her chiefest pillars supporteth and main∣taineth idolatrie in the highest degree. Which will yet appeare more evi∣dently by these few instances: 1 Doe they not devote themselves, dedicate Temples, consecrate Altars, appoint offices, make daily prayers, vow pil∣grimages, and present offerings to the blessed Virgin, and doe all such out∣ward acts as properly appertaine toAug. l. 3. c. 32. de Civit. Dei. Templa sacra, Sacerdotes & quicquid ad latriam pertinet. Latria? Is not this to equalize her with her Son? SurelyVega in Apc. 12. sec. 2. Constituta est super omnem creaturam, & quaecun{que} Jesu curvat genu, matri quoque pro∣nus supplicat; & filii gloriam cum matre non tam communem judico quam eandem. Vega and Biels words import no lesse: She is pla∣ced (saith Vega) above all creatures, and whosoever boweth the knee to Jesus, falls downe flat before his mother; the glory of the mother and the sons I ac∣count to be the same. Almighty God (saithExposit. super Can. Mis. Biel) hath divided his kingdome betweene himselfe and her, in such sort that all matter of justice he reserveth to himselfe, but matter of mercie he referreth to her. In which consideration, or some such like, it is, that in countries subject to the See of Rome, all men and women, wheresoever they are, in the Citie or the field, thrice a day, when the Ave marie bell rings, send up their united devotions to her; and where one professeth himselfe a devoto to our Saviour, whose Townes devote themselves to her: where oneEdw. Sanas his relation of Religion. prayeth at a crucifix, ten pray at her Image: where one fasteth on Friday, which they account our Lords day, ma∣ny fast on Saturday, which they count our Ladies day. To conclude: they conclude all their prayers with an Ave Maria, as we doe with our Lords prayer, and most of their treatises with Laus deiparae Virgini, praise be to the Virgin mother of God: and in the Psalter called Bonaventures, they have
entituled all the hundred and fifty Psalmes of David to her; and where hee saith Lord, they put Lady. 2. Secondly, doe they not make an Idoll of the Crosse of Christ, when they professe that they worship it cultu latriae? To omit Aquinas and An∣dradius alledged by meConc. 12. else-where,Cap. 49. As∣serimus cum sententià com∣muniore & in scholis magis tritâ, Crucem colendam esse latria, id est, cultu divino. Gretzer the Jesuit in his book of the Crosse saith, Wee affirme, according to the more common and received opi∣nion in the Schooles, that the Crosse of Christ is to be worshipped with latry, that is, divine worship. 3. Thirdly, doe they not make an Idoll of the Sacramentall bread, or the Host, as they call it; to which they pray and confesse, before which they fall downe, when it is carried in solemne procession on corpus Christi day? Lastly, doe they not make Idols of their Images, and Reliques of Sanits, before which they burne incense, and bow downe when they pray, dire∣cting their prayers toward them, and fastening their eyes on them? Here to stop the mouthes of our clamorous adversaries, who traduce us for nothing more than partiality in handling controversies; I will acquaint you with the answer they give to the former Bill of enditements. 1. Some of them say, that they worship not the Image, but God by the Image. 2. Others confesse, that they worship Images, but deny them to be Idols: to worship an Idoll is idolatry, not to worship an Image, say they. 3. Others salve all with a distinction of dulia and latria; they give dulia to Saints and their Images, and hyperdulia to the blessed Virgin, but latria only to God. But they shall not so evade: for to their first evasion wee oppose these barres: First, that it is idolatry to worship God in, or by an Image. Secondly, that their learned Clerkes of later time maintaine, that the image it selfe is to be worshipped. That it is unlawfull and offensive to the Highest, to worship him by a proxie, or set up an image to conveigh honour unto him by it; I evict out of the fortieth of Esay, Ver. 18.21. To whom will ye liken God? or what likeness will you compare him unto? And out of the fourth of Deuteronomy, Ver. 15. Take good heed therefore unto your selves: for yee saw no manner of similitude in the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb, beware lest you corrupt your selves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure. Certainly, if God cannot, if he will not be likened by any thing, he will not like of that worship which commeth to him by or through an image; if it be unlawfull to make an image of God, what suppose you is it to make a god of an Image, by adoring it in Gods stead? Was not Phoedra an adulteresse, when shee lay with Hipolytus, because shee protested that shee embraced Theseus in him, whom he so neere resembled? Were the Jewes that worshipped the Calfe, or they that worshipped the brasen Serpent, or the image of Baal, free from idolatry? They dare not say it, because the Spirit of God con∣demneth them for Idolaters; yet they might plead for themselves, as Pa∣pists doe, that they worshipped God in the Calfe, and Christ to come in the Serpent, and him that dwelleth in a light that cunnot bee approached
unto in the image of Baal or the Sunne. For they were not such Calves as to fixe their devotion on a Calfe of their owne making; they were not so deceived by the old Serpent, as to attribute divine power to a Serpent of brasse; their eyes were not so dazled with the beames of the Sunne, that they mistooke the Sunne for God: No, the words ofExod. 32.5. Aaron, To morrow is a feast Jehovae, to the Lord: and those of God himselfe, ThouHos. 2.16. shalt call me no more Baal: for I will take away the names of Baalim out of their mouth; make it a cleare case, that they made but a stale of the Image who bowed downe before it, intending the honour to God himselfe, asJoseph. antiq. Jud. Jeroboam instituit ut in vitulis Deus coleretur. Josephus testi∣fieth of Jeroboam: Jeroboam, saith hee, appointed that God should bee wor∣shipped in those Calves which he set up in Dan and Bethel. And what shall we say, if Papists are indebted to the Heathen for this answer? who set this varnish upon their idolatrous practice, as you may see inLact. divin. institut. l. 2. c. 2. Non simula∣cra colimus, sed eos ad quo∣rum imaginem sunt facta. Lactantius,Tyr. ser. 38. Dicunt se maximum De∣um in simula∣cris colere. Ty∣rius, andClem. constit. Apostol. lib. 1. cap. 6, 7. Aiunt, nos ad hono∣rem invisibilis Dei, visibils Imagines ado∣ramus. Clemens Romanus. Saint Paul also testifieth as much of the Hea∣then in generall (Rom. 1.23.) They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and to foure footed beasts, and to creeping things. And of the Athenians in particular (Acts 17.23.) Whom therefore yee ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. The greatest God, as Tyrius speaketh, the invisible God, as Clemens, the incorruptible God, as the Apostle, the God whom Paul preached, the Lord Jehovah is the true God that made heaven and earth: yet the Jewes and Gentiles, who worshipped him by an image, or according to their own imaginations, in Scripture stand charged with Idolatry, and for ought ap∣peares to the contrary as deeply, as if their devotion had pitched and set∣tled upon the image of the Calfe, the Serpent, the Sunne, the starre Rem∣pham, the similitudes of men, birds, or creeping things, and not glaunced by them to their Maker. Yee heare that the Papists plea, take it at the best, is no better than the idolatrous Jewes plea, the Priests of Baals plea, the Gentiles plea: and what if the learnedest of their owne side debarre them of this plea also? what if their great Doctors teach, that the image is to be worshipped for it selfe, and not only in relation to the prototypon, as they speake? what if they curse all those who make any scruple of the ve∣neration of Images? Certainly CardinallLib. 2. de I∣mag. Sanc. c. 21. Imagines Christi & Sanctorum venerandae sunt, non so∣lum per acci∣dens & impro∣priè, sed etiam per se & pro∣priè, ita ut ip∣sae terminent venerationem, ut in se consi∣derantur, & non solùm ut vicem gerunt exemplaris. Bellarmine his words are plaine enough: The Images of Christ and Saints are to be worshipped not only by ac∣cident and improperly, but also by, or for themselves, and properly in such sort, that they bounded & termined the worship, as they are considered in themselvs, and not only as they stand for the samplar, that is, the person or thing they re∣present. This his assertion he there endeavoureth to prove out of the se∣cond Councell of Nice, and the late Conventicle at Trent, which who so readeth, cannot but see that speech of the Prophet David verified in the Patrons thereof: They that make Images are like unto them, and so are all they that put their trust in them. To which text Clemens Alexandrinus, as it seemeth to mee, had an eye, in that his pleasant allusion, whereby hee re∣presenteth the folly of Idolaters: As (saith hee) the naturall birds were be∣guiled by the counterfeit, and flew to the Pigeons that were drawne in the Painters shop; so naturall stockes flye to artificiall, senslesse men to senslesse Idols. How wardeth the Cardinall off this blow? after this manner: Wee have no recourse unto, nor performe any religious service to any Idoll, though
wee both teach and practice Image-worship. Why? what is the difference between an Image and an Idoll? An Image (saith he) is the representation of something which really subsisteth, as of God, Angel, or man; but an Idoll is the semblance of a thing feigned or imaginary, that hath no beeing at all, but in the fancy of the deviser. God in the Law forbiddeth us to worship the later sorts of similitudes, not the former. Let us try this new coined distinction by the touch-stone of Gods Word: How is it written?Exod. 20.4. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe Pesell, that is, any thing that is carved or graven, as not only the interlineary, Vatablus, Tremelius,, Sculp∣tile. and the Septuagint; but the vulgar Latine also, corrected by Sixtus,, Sculp∣sit, dolavit, Buxtorf. Epit. rad. and re∣vised by Clemens, render the Hebrew. Admit that the word Pesel signifieth not an Image, as Justin Martyr tran∣slateth it , but an Idoll, say these first words of the commandement meet with the worshippers of Idols, not of Images, yet certainly the clause following (nor the likenesse of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water under the earth) reacheth home to all Images. For all Images are likenesses of something in heaven, earth, or under the earth. The Idoll of Baal was the likenesse of something in heaven, the Calfe of something on earth, Dagon of something in the waters under the earth. For the first was the representation and similitude of the Sunne, the second of a Beast, the third of a Fish: yet the Scripture calleth these images Idols, and their worshippers Idolaters: therefore the Papists are in the same damnation with them, and contradict themselves in terminis, in saying they worship Images, not Idols. For every Image worshipped is an Idoll. True (say the later Papists) if it be worshipped cultu latriae, with divine worship, not cultu duliae, which is an inferiour kinde. To cut off this third head of Hydra with the sword of the Spirit. First, we ought not to distinguish where the Law distinguisheth not: It is a good rule in the civill Law, and holds in Divinity; but this distinction of dulia and latria hath no ground in Scripture, where the words dulia and latria are indifferently used; and as latria is attributed unto men, so du∣lia toMat. 4.10. Rom. 12.11. Vid. Humfri∣dum in vit. Juel. God. Secondly, the Commandement forbiddeth expresly all both inward and outward worship: all outward in those words; Thou shalt not bow downe before them: all inward in the words following, nor worship them. If there∣fore their dulia imply either an inward, or an outward worship of the likenesse of any thing that is in the world, it is prohibited in the second Commandement. Thirdly, if it should be granted them, that there is some difference be∣tween dulia and latria, proper worship and improper, per se and per ac∣cidens, absolute and relative; yet questionlesse the honest vulgar are not a∣ble to tithe this Mint and Cummin, and cut these scholasticall distinctions to a haire, their dulia is latria, and latria dulia; and asComment. in lib. Aug. de . Dei. Ludovicus vives con∣fessed before they clipped his tongue, they exhibit a like manner of devo∣tion to Saints, and their Images and Reliques, to that which the Heathen did to their gods and goddesses. Fourthly, all worship is either civill or religious; to performe civill wor∣ship to Images, as if they were our concives, is ridiculous: to yeeld religi∣ous,
is impious. If by cultus duliae they mean civill complement, they must shew what familiarity or civill society the living have with the dead, and what courtesie their Images can returne backe againe. Indeed we reade of an Image of our Lady thatDoctor An∣drewes resp. ad apol. Bellar. Obvertit ei posteriora. turned her backe parts to a Carthusian that came tardy to Mattens; but never of any that performed any complement before. No civill respect therefore is due to any Image, and much lesse religious: for SaintLib. 14. cont. Faus. Mani∣che. Austin teacheth expresly, that the Apostle forbiddeth any wor∣ship of religion to be given to a creature. Lastly, the Jesuites and Schoolmen before alledged teach, that the Image of God, and of Christ, and of the Crosse; and all Papists teach, that the ele∣ments of bread and wine after consecration in the Sacrament, are to be wor∣shipped cultu latriae, or with divine worship. Therefore notwithstanding all their slips and evasions, the second Commandement taketh hold of them, and Gods fearfull judgement against Idolaters will seize on them also, if they avert them not by turning from dead Images to the living God. I will cut off the thread of my discourse with Aristotle his sharpe censure of the Milesians,Aristot. po∣litic. , The Milesians are not fooles, yet they doe just the same things which fooles doe: even so though we forbeare to fasten the name of Heathenish Idolaters upon Papists; yet sure∣ly they doe the same things as they did. First, the Heathen carried their gods of gold and silverBaruch 6.4. upon their shoul∣ders; so doe the Papists beare out their Images and Reliques, inclosed in chasses of gold and silver, in their solemne procession on high dayes. Secondly, the Heathen decked their Images, as if they were men and women, with apparrell (yet cannot these gods save themselves from rust and moth, though they beVer. 11. covered with purple raiment) and who knoweth not that Papists put costly apparrell on their Images? almost every Saint among them hath his holy day and working day suit. Thirdly, the Heathen lighted candles before their Images,Ver. 19. though the Image seeth not one of them: and doe not Papists set tapers before theirs? Fourthly, the faces of the Heathen Idols were blacked withVer. 21. smoake: so are the Popish Images with the fume of the incense they burne to them. Fifthly, the HeathenVer. 41. spake to their Idols as if they were able to under∣stand them: so doe the Papists to the wood of the Crosse; Ave lignum spes unica. Sixthly, the Heathenish Priests beards and heads wereVer. 31. shaven: and so are our Popish Priests crownes. Seventhly, Baals Clergy (if I may so speake) was divided into Priests and Chemarims, so termed for the blacke attire they ware: so is the Po∣pish into Seminary Priests and Jesuites, birds of the same feather with the Chemarims. Eighthly, the Heathen about thePolid. virg. de invent. re∣rum. l. 1. c. 5. calends of February visited all their Temples with lights: a like ceremony the Papists use at Candlemasse. Ninthly, at the beginning of the Spring the Heathen kept their Hilaria feasts, in which it was lawful to revel & riot in all kinds of disorder: in place whereof the Papists have brought in their Carnivals about the same time. Tenthly, the Heathen commended every City and Village to the pro∣tection of some god or goddesse: Juno was Lady guardian of Carthage,
Venus of Cyprus, Diana of Ephesus, Pallas of Athens, &c. and have not the Papists likewise multiplyed their Saints according to the number of their Cities? and doe they not share the patronages of them betweene them? Doth not Venice fall to Saint Markes lot? Paris to Saint Geno∣viefe's? Spaine to Saint James's? France to Saint Dennises? Scotland to Saint Andrewes? Ireland to Saint Patrickes? England to Saint Georges? Eleventhly, the Heathen assigned severall offices to severall gods, calling upon Ceres for corne, upon Bacchus for wine, upon Aesculapius for health, upon Mercurie for wealth, Apollo for wisedome, &c. In like manner the Papists addresse themselves to particular Saints upon particular and speciall occasions; to Saint Genoviefe for raine, to Saint Marcan for faire wea∣ther, Saint Michael in battell, Saint Nicholas in a sea tempest, Saint Eustace in hunting, Saint Roch and Sebastian for remedies against the plague, Saint Raphel against catarres, Saint Apollonia against the tooth-ach, St. Anthony against inflammations, Saint Margaret for safe delivery in childe-birth, and to other Saints upon other occasions, as if God had granted a kind of Monopoly of the sevrall commodities of this life to severall Saints. Twelfthly, will you have yet more? Hercules hath left his club to Saint Christopher, Janus hath resigned up his keyes to Saint Peter, Lucina her of∣fice of midwife to Saint Margaret, the Muses their instruments of musicke to Cecilia, and Jupiter Hammon his hornes to Moses. Sentio me jam de faece haurire, I now draw very low, the very lees and dregges of Popery, which whosoever sucketh, unlesse hee cast them up a∣gaine by repentance, is like to sup up the dregges of the viall of Gods wrath. And now (mee thinkes) I see the Sonne of man looke upon some of the re∣formed Churches with eyes sparkling like fire, and stamping with his brazen feet, to see these abominations of Jezebel winked at as they are in so many places. I meddle not here with any deliberation of State, fitter for the Councell Table than the Pulpit: but discover to every private Christian what his duty is, to refrain from the society of Idolaters; & I beseech them for the love of him, who hath espoused their soules to himselfe, and hath decked them with the richest jewels of his grace, and made them a joynter of his Kingdome, to beware that they be not enticed to spirituall fornicati∣on, to forbeare the company of all those who solicite them in this kind: nay farther, to detect such persons to authority, that they may learne not to blaspheme the truth of our Religion, nor seduce his Majesties subjects from their allegiance to the Prince, and conformity to his Lawes. Pliny writeth of certainePlin. nat. hist. l. 8 c. 15. Indiginis in∣noxii, peregri∣nos interi∣munt. Efts in Tyrinth, and Snakes in Syria, that doe no hurt to the natives, but sting strangers to death: it may bee some have the like conceit of our English Seminary Priests and Jesuites, who have done so great mischiefe beyond the Sea, that they have no power or will to hurt any here at home; and therefore dare more boldly converse with them, because their outward carriage is faire. But I beseech them to consider that the Panther hideth her ougly visage, which shee knoweth will terrifie the beasts from comming neere her, alluring them with the sweet smell of her body; but as soone as they come within her reach, shee maketh a prey of them. Therefore as you tender the salvation of your body and soule, your estate in this life, and the life to come, take heed how you play at
the hole of the Cockatrice, and familiarly converse with the great Whore, or any of her Minions, lest they draw you to naughtinesse and spirituall lewdnesse. Have no part with them that have no part in God, or have part with abominable Idols. If the good Bishop Saint Ambrose, being com∣manded by Valentinian the Emperour to deliver up a Church in his Dio∣cesse to the Arrians, gave this answer, That hee would first yeeld up his life: Prius est ut vitam mihi Imperator, quàm fidem adimat: shall wee give up our soules, which are the Temples of the living God, to Idolatrous wor∣ship? If Saint John the Evangelist would not stay in the bath with Cerin∣thus the Hereticke; shall we dare freely to partake with worser Heretickes in the pledges of salvation, and wash our soules with them in the royall bath of Christs bloud?Ambros. ep. 37. Pollui se putabat, si A∣ram vidisset: ferendmve est, ut Gentilis sacrificet Chri∣stianus inter∣sit? Constantius the Emperour thought himselfe pollu∣ted, if he had but seen an Heathenish Altar; and Saint Ambrose proposeth it as a thing most absurd and intolerable, that a Christian should be present at the sacrifices of the Heathen. Our Saviour in this place, and Saint1 Cor. 10. Paul in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, would not have Christians to eate any of those things that were sacrificed unto Idols: Nay, the ProphetPsal. 16.4. David professeth, that he will not so much as name an Idol: Their offerings of bloud will I not offer, nor make mention of their names in my lips. I end, and seale up my meditations upon these words spoken to an Angel, with the words spoken by anApoc. 14.9. Angel: If any worship the Beast and his Image, and receive his marke in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy Angels & the Lamb: and the smoake of their torments shall a∣scend for ever & ever. And they shall have no rest neither day nor night, which worship the Beast and his Image, & whosoever receiveth the print of his name. Gracious Lord, who gracest the Ministers of the Gospel with the title of Angels, make them in their knowledge and life angelicall: keep them not only from sinnes of omission and commission, but also from sinnes of permission; that all may see their works, and their love, and their service, and their faith, and their patience; their love of thee, and their service to thee, and their faith in thee, and their patience for thee, and their growth in all these gra∣ces, and that thou maist have nothing against them. And sith thou hast dis∣played the Romish Jezebel unto us by her three markes, of imposture, impu∣rity, and idolatry, breed in us all a greater loathing and detestation of her a∣bominations: preserve us by the sincere preaching of the Word, and powerfull operation of thy Spirit, that wee bee neither deceived by her imposture, to be∣leeve her false prophesies, neither defiled in our body by her impurity, to com∣mit fornication, nor in soule by her idolatry, to eate things sacrificed unto Idols.
SERMONS PREACHED AT OXFORD.
FOURE ROWES OF PRECIOUS STONES. A Rehearsall Sermon preached in Saint Maries Church at Oxford, Anno 1610. THE XXXV. SERMON. EXOD. 28.15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. 15. And thou shalt make the breast-plate of judgement with cunning worke. 16. Foure square shall it be, being doubled. 17. And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even foure rowes of stones: the order shall be this, a Rubie, a Topaze, and an Emrald, in the first rowe. 18. And in the second row thou shalt set a Carbuncle, a Saphir, and a Dia∣mond. 19. And in the third row a Turkeise, and an Agate, and an Amethist. 20. And in the fourth row a Beril, and an Onyx, and a Jasper: and they shall be set in gold in their inclosings or imbosments, Hebrew, fillings. 21. And the stones shall bee with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name shall they be, according to the twelve Tribes. Right Worshipfull, &c. QUintilianInstitut. orat. lib. 1. cap. 1. instructing parents how to lay the ground-co∣lours of vertues in the soft mindes of tender infants, and acquaint them with the rudiments of learning, adviseth, Eburneas literarum formas iis in lusum offerre, To give them the letters of the Alphabet fairely drawne, painted or carved in ivory, gold, or the like solid and delectable matter, to play withall, that by their sports, as it were, unawares those simple formes might be imprinted in their memories, whereby we expresse all the notions of our mind in writing: even so it pleased our heavenly Fa∣ther, in the infancy and nonage of his Church, to winne her love with many
glorious shewes of rites and ceremonies, as it were costly babies, represen∣ting the body of her husband Christ Jesus: and to the end she might with greater delight, quasi per lusum, get by heart the principles of saving know∣ledge, and easilier spell the letters of the Gospel, he vouchsafed to worke them in embroidered silkes, and engrave them in gold, silver, and such pre∣cious treasure as fill the rowes in my text. Thus much concerning the le∣gall Hieroglyphicks we learne by St. Paul, who in his Epistles to the Gala∣thians, Corinthians, and Hebrewes, expounding divers types and stories of the old law spiritually, satis ostendit caetera quo{que} ejusdem esse intelligentiae,Hieron. ep. ad Fabiol. tea∣cheth us plainly that the rest are of the same nature, and admit of the like in∣terpretation. And hereto S.In Cant. hom. 1. Origen fitteth the words spoken to the Spouse in the Canticles, Faciemus tibi similitudines auri, cum puncturis argenti, we will make thee golden resemblances of true things, cumWith certain points, rayes, notes, or spar∣kles of spiritu∣all meaning. puncturis argenti, id est, scintillis quibusdam spiritualis intelligentiae. According to which allusive interpretation of that allegorizing Writer, the gold it selfe of the Altar was but a similitude of the true gold,Apoc. 3.18. I counsell thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou maist be rich. profered by our Saviour to the Angell of Laodicea, and the precious stones named in my text are but similitudes of that precious stone to which St.1 Pet. 2.6. Peter pointeth, Behold, I lay in Sion a chiefe corner stone, elect, precious: whereupon St.Jer. in Ezek. de gemmis coro. Reg. Tyr. 28.13. Jerome sweetly inferres, that all the Jewels mentioned in my text are to bee sold by the wise Christian Merchant, to buy that , pearle of great price mentioned in theMat. 13.46. Gospel; Omnes istae gemmae Prophetarum & Apostolorum sunt, quae comparatione Christi venduntur in Evangelio, ut ematur preciocissima Margarita. Mart. ep. l. 5.Sardonychas, Smaragd', Adamantas, Jaspidas, uno Portat in articulo stella, Severe, tuus. O Severus, thou settest out thy mistresse most richly, with every joint in her fingers laden with Jewels, Rubies, Emralds, Jaspers, and Diamonds: but pardon me if I beleeve there are more gemmes of art in thy verses, than of nature on her fingers. Multas in digitis, plures in carmine gemmas Invenies: inde est haec puto culta manus. Behold here in Aarons breast-plate all those and many more precious stones, in all twelve, bearing the name of the twelve Patriarkes, set in ou∣ches of gold, and tied to the golden rings of the Ephod, a sacred vestment which Aaron and his successours were to put on before they gave judge∣ment, when the people asked counsell of God. So much of the pectorall is cleerely set downe in this booke: but that Aarons breast-plate of judge∣ment was a perfect astrolab is but Abenezra his fantasie without judgement, refuted by Tostatus. Likewise, that together with the names of the Patri∣arkes there was engraven in every stone the name of some Starre or Angel, ut confirmaretur memoria tribus apud Deum, is but a muddie talmuddie tra∣dition, implying ridiculously and impiously, that God needeth or useth the helps of artificiall memorie.Antiq. Judaic. l. 3. c. 9. Per du∣odecimas gem∣mas quas in pe∣cto ontifex insu  in bello tori∣am Deus pro∣nunciare sole∣bat. Nam pri∣usquam exerci∣tus se moveret, tantus fulgor ex iis emicabat, ut toti populo facilè innotesceret adesle Deum, opem{que} iis esse allaturum. Josephus telleth us a faire tale (and Baronius
graceth his annals with it) of an unusuall and marvellous lightning of some of these gemmes, which clearly foreshewed victory to the people when they asked counsell of God by the Ephod, before they went into warre: a strange kinde of propheticall illumination, not by the irradiation of the Spirit into their mindes, but by the scintillation and lustre of stones to the eye. But the Scriptures silence in a matter of such note, and Josephus his owne confessi∣on, that for the space of two hundred yeares before his time there was no such new kind of soothsaying (not by the aspect of the heavens, but of the Priests breast, not by twinckling starres, but by sparkling stones) giveth us just cause to suspect the truth of this narration; and much more of an ap∣pendix thereunto which we find in Suidas and Epiphanius, that the Dia∣mond in the second row of stones, as it cleerely foreshewed victorie by the extraordinary glare of it; so it portended bloody slaughter by suddenly turning into a red colour, and finall desolation by changing into blacke. For in the booke of Judges we have the manner of Gods revealing future e∣vents to the Priests when they had on the linnen Ephod, set downe not by mute signes, but by created voyce; and therefore St.Qu. 117. in Exod. Austine accounteth the former relation to be a meere fable: Fabulantur quidam lapidem fuisse, cujus color, sive ad prospera, sive ad adversa, mutaretur. Howbeit, sith theCa. 18. v. 24. Author of the booke of wisedome affirmeth, that the glorie, or, as others translate, the memorable acts of the patriarches were engraven in the foure rowes of stones, whether in the choyce of these jewels, respect were not had to such as fittest resembled by their beautie or vertue something me∣morable concerning the Patriarch, or his posteritie whose name it bare, I determine not absolutely on either side. First, because neither the Jewish nor the Christian Interpreters agree in the reckoning of the stones, or the order of the Patriarches names engraven in them. The Thargum of Jerusa∣lem and the Chaldee Paraphrase expresse them after this manner: Upon the 1 Sardine, was graven 1 Reuben, Sonnes of Leah. 2 Topaze, 2 Simeon, 3 Smaragd, 3 Levi, 4 Chalcedonie, 4 Judah, 5 Saphir, 5 Issachar, 6 Sardonyx, 6 Zabulon, 7 Hyacinth, 7 Dan, Of Bilhah Rachels maid. 8 Chrysoprase, 8 Napthali, 9 Amethyst, 9 Gad, Of Zilpha Leahs maid. 10 Chrysolite, 10 Asher, 11 Beryll, 11 Joseph, Of Rachel. 12 Jasper, 12 Benjamin. Others differ in translation of the stones, and conceive the names of the Patriarches to have beene graven in them according to the order of nature; according to which after Judah they place Dan, and then Napthali after
Gad, then Asher after Issachar, then Zabulon, then Joseph and Ben∣jamin. The Author of the vulgar translation, which the Councell of Trent defineth to be authenticall, thus ranketh the stones in the foure rowes: In the first, 1 Sardius. 2 Topazius. 3 Smaragdus. In the second, 4 Carbunculus. 5 Saphirus. 6 Jaspis. In the third, 7 Ligyrius. 8 Achates. 9 Amethystus. In the fourth, 10 Chrysolitus. 11 Onychinus. 12 Beryllus. The Kings Translatours thus: In the first, 1 Sardius. 2 Topaze. 3 Carbuncle. In the second, 4 Emrald. 5 Saphire. 6 Diamond. In the third, 7 Alygure. 8 Agate. 9 Amethyst. In the fourth, 10 Beryll. 11 Onyx. 12 Jasper. Secondly, because Aben Ezra a great Rabbin ingenuously confesseth, that there is no certainty to be had of these stones and their distinction: be∣cause Gehon interpreteth them Kirtsono at his pleasure; neither is there ex∣tant any tradition in their Cabala concerning them: yet because wee may have undoubted certainty of most of them, either from their names in the Hebrew or Chaldee, as of the Saphir, Turkeys, and Jasper; or from their etymologies, or by comparing them with the twelve precious stones men∣tioned in the Apocalyps: and because the rowes and stones in them may serve for places and Images in artificiall memory, to imprint more firmely in our mind some remarkable story of the Patriarchs, whose names were engraven in them, I will observe some congruities between them. 1 The first precious stone is the Sardius, Sardonix, or Rubinus, in He∣brew Odem, ab Adam, signifying red earth, in English a Rubie; and the first sonne of Jacob, whose name by the consent of all was engraven in it, was Reuben. Behold Reuben in a Rubie. And as their names, so their qualities agree: a Rubie is an orient jewell, and Reuben is called theGen. 49.3. excellency of dignity: yet the goodliest and most glorious Rubie, saithComment. in Exod. Ystella, nubecu∣lâ quâdam offunditur, is over-shadowed with some cloud: so was Reubens glory, as it followeth ver. 4. Thou shalt not be excellent, because thou wentest up to thy fathers bed. A Rubie in Latine is called Carneolus, in Greeke , quasi , because it is of the colour of flesh: and did not Reuben deserve the name of Carneolus, when hee had carnall society with his fa∣thers Concubine? 2 The second stone is the Topaze; so the Seventy, Saint Jerome, Jose∣phus, Junius, and all the Transltours of note whom I have seen, render the Hebrew : to whose authority I adde a conjecture out ofGeogr. l. 6. Strabo,
where he maketh mention of a precious stone found in the Island called O∣phias, neere the Easterne Aethiopia, now called the countrey of the Abys∣sens. This jewell he calleth , from the great search made for it, even by the Kings of Egypt, who, as he there saith, hired great mul∣titudes to seeke for it in all places of the Island; and that after they found store of them, the Island changed his name, and was called Topazium: which testimony of this Heathen Historiographer is somewhat confir∣med by the words ofJob 28.19. The Topaze of Aethiopia shall not equall it. Job, Non aequabitur ei Topazius Aethiopiae; Hebr. Phitdah cush. The Topaze is a Gemme (as the Naturalists describe it) in the day time between a greene and yellow, but in the night of a fiery co∣lour, which well resembleth the fieryGen. 49.6, 7. Jud. 9.2. rage of Simeon, the second sonne of Jacob, whose name was engraven in it. 3 The third stone is an Emrald, in the Chaldee is Smaragden, in the Arabick Zamrad, in Greeke , in Latine Smaragdus, in Hebrew  derived from Baraq,Barqueth. signifying to lighten, because this stone resem∣bleth lightning out of a thicke cloud; or, as Buxtorfius affirmeth, à fulgo∣re, from the lustre of it, which more delighteth the eye than the splendour of any other precious stones, because it is a perfect greene stone, and doth not dazle the eye as others, but comforteth it rather.Comment. in Exod. Borrhaeus writeth of it, that it is a great cooler and preserver of chastity: hee reporteth also (I know not how truly) that being worne upon the finger of an uncleane person, in flagrante crimine fractus legitur, it brake suddenly, as a Venice glasse with poyson. Which may put us in mind, as of the speciall act ofGen. 34.27. Levi (whose name was engraven in this stone) mentioned in revenging his sisters rape upon the Sechemites, so in generall of chastity, of all men best becomming the Levites. Moreover, in that an Emrald glasse-like representeth the shape of all things before it, and therefore Nero, asNat. hist. l. 36. c. 5. Gladi∣atorum pugnas spectbat Sma∣ragdo. Pliny writeth, beheld all Pa∣geants and Fencers prizes through his Emrald, we may take occasion to re∣member St. Peters exhortation to Pastors, who are the Levites of the Go∣spel, to be1. Pet. 5.3. , samplars to their flocke, and in their lives to re∣present the perfect shapes of all vertues. 4 The fourth stone, according to Junius, is a Chrysoprasus or Chryso∣lite, in Hebrew Nophek, from  to blow or breathe, because, asDe Gem. Rueus writeth, this Gemme hath a singular vertue in helping the breathing parts, and curing those that are short breathed; but the Radicals in  are not the same with those in Naphach; in the one the last Radicall is Cheth , in the other it is Caph , and therefore I rather render the word with the Geneva Translatours, and Josephus, andDiction Heb. ex rad. David. imhi. Munster, the Carbuncle; because the Se∣venty render it , and St.Ezek 28.13. Jerome, excellently learned in the Hebrew, Carbunculus. This Gemme is of a red colour, glowing like a coale, with a streake of milke drawne circle-wise about it, (as the expert Naturalists de∣scribe it) which well agreeth with that we reade of Judah,Gen. 49.11, 12. whose name was engraven in this stone; Hee washeth his garments in the bloud of the grape, his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milke. Moreover, it is prophesied of Judah, that hee should give the law to his brethren, and make them take up and beare his yoake: and Rueus observeth out of Ari∣stotle, concerning the Carbuncle, quod solus possit figuram suam aliis Gemmis imprimere, that the Carbuncle alone, if he be put by other pre∣cious
stones, imprints his colour and forme in them. 5. The fifth stone is a Saphir, which retaines his name for ought appea∣reth in all languages, in Latine Saphirus, in Greeke , in Hebrew  from , to number or write, because this gemme is the aptest of any to be engraven on; and it is a tradition amongst the Jewes, that the stones in which God wrote the Commandements were Saphirs. The Saphirs of the richest kinde are of an azure colour, like that Serpent to whichGen. 49.17. Dan is com∣pared (whose name was ingraven in this stone) Dan shall be a Serpent by the way, a Snake by the path. Dioscorides saith, the Saphir is a speciall cordiall, which may have some reference to the haughty courage ofDeut. 33.22. Dan is as a Lions whelp. Dan: of whom it is also prophesied, Dan shallGen. 49.16. judge his people. And in the vision ofCap. 1. V. 26. Eze∣kiel, The likenesse of the Throne of judgement is said to bee as the appearance of a Saphir stone. 6. The sixth stone, according to the author of the vulgar Latine, which all Papists hold for authenticall, is Jaspis, the Jasper stone; but this is an apparent errour: for it is confessed on all sides, that in all the foure rankes the stones were severall, as likewise were the twelve Patriarchs, whose names were engraven in them: but the Jasper is the last stone in the fourth row, in the Hebrew Jasphe: Therefore the third stone in the second row cannot be the Jasper. What stone then was it? in all probability the Dia∣mond, as the Seventy and Josephus render it, and Aben Ezra andJahalom A∣damas lapis pretiosus sic dictus, quòd pertundit ac confringit om∣nes alios lapi∣des, ut notat Aben Ezra. Exod. 28.18. Buxtor∣fius prove it from the Hebrew etymology,  from , the word in the Hebrew signifieth a stone that is stronger than all other, and will break them in pieces. In this stone was the name of Naphthali written, who was so named byGen. 30.8. Rachel, because shee got the upper hand of her sister: With great wrastlings have I wrastled with my sister, and I have prevailed, and shee called his name Naphthali. Moreover, wee reade a prophesie in the land ofEsay 9.1. Naphthali, that the people which sate in darknesse should see a great light, which wasMatth. 4.15, 16. fulfilled in our Saviours preaching there: now what fitter jewell in the world to prefigure and shew forth this wonderfull great light than the Diamond, which is incomparably the brightest of all precious stones? Thus I might parallel the twelve stones, and the twelve Patriarchs; but to avoid saciety, and meet with your expectation, I leave that taske, and observe onely for the present, that the names of the twelve Patriarchs, which were engraven at large in these jewells shining on the breast-plate of Aaron, were engraven againe in a lesser character in the two Onyx stones on his shoulder; which is both a warrant for, and an embleme of my pre∣sent work, which must be a repetition and contraction of those precious do∣ctrines, which before you saw expressed by the foure Preachers in divers methods and stiles, as it were in divers rowes, with the point of divers Dia∣monds. It is very probable also, that the selfe same stones, as SaintEp. 28. Ezek. 28.13. Je∣rome observeth, deck'd the crowne of the King of Tyre, and are laid in the foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem: which may teach us, that precious doctrines and observations, like so many jewells, may be againe and againe presented to your spirituall view. Were I to vindicate this exercise from the often repeated cavells against repetitions, I would answer them as Mar∣tial doth those who carped at him for handling the same subject twice, and falling upon like conceits:
Mart. epigr. lib. 1.Lascivos leporum cursus, lususque leonum, Quod major nobis charta minorque gerit: Et bis idem facimus: nimium si, Stella, videtur Hoc tibi; bis leporem tu quoque pone mihi. But to you, my beloved and much reverenced brethren, I alledge for my apology the example not onely of the Gentiles atAct. 13.42. Antiochia, who besought the Apostles to preach unto them the same words the next Sabbath: and of SaintPhilip. 3.1. Paul, whom it grieved not to write to the Philippians the same things: but also of our Saviour Christ, who in his prayerMat. 26.44. repeated the third time the same words; and John 17. often quavereth upon that sweete close, I in them, and they in mee; and, that they may be one, as thou and I are one. It isCic. de orat. l. 1. Subacto o∣pus est solo nec novato dun∣taxat, sed & iterato. not once plowing, but the often breaking up of the earth which maketh it fruitfull; nor is it the incident, but the reflected beame of the Sunne that giveth the greatest heate: in which consideration, they who have performed this great taske before mee, might receive great warmth of comfort, because the light of heavenly doctrine incident upon their me∣mories, like the beames of the Sunne upon glasse or other polite bodies, were reverberated from them per radium reflexum, and thereby received greater vertue: but now the same cast backe from my fluid and waterish memory per radium refractum, cannot but lose much of their light and grace. The brighter the colour is, the more duskie the shadow must needs be; the perfecter the discourse, the more imperfect and difficult the epito∣mie: for in all such the thronging the parts is the wronging the whole, and contraction can be no better than detraction. Had these learned Sermons been like Vines, that runne into many superfluous stemmes, I might con∣ceive some hope by pruning them, to effect that for which Saint Jerome commendeth the Athenian Oratours,Ep. ad Ru∣stic. Ut eloquentiae torcularia, non verbo∣rum pampinis, sed sensuum quasi uvarum expressionibus redundarent: but these were rather like the rowes of precious stones in my Text. Now concer∣ning such, the rule of the Jewellers is, If there be any graine, cloud, or specke in a gemme, which cannot bee ground out without sensible abating the stone, not to meddle with it, because the losse in the matter being so precious, cannot be recompenced with any beauty that art can give. The first of them, for the faire blossomes of eloquence in it, and the Au∣thors flourishing stile, deserveth the name of terra florida in America. The second, for the happy plenty of all things in it, the name of the for∣tunatae Insulae. Reddit ubi cererem tellus inarata quotannis, & imputata floret usque vinea: Germinat, & nunquam fallentis termes olivae, suamque pulla ficus ornat arborem. Or rather ofNat. hist. l. 18.

Tocape in Pliny, wherein under a faire palme tree you may see an olive, under an olive a figge-tree, under a figge-tree a vine, under a vine

Angl. King. The third I know no better country to compare unto, than terra de La∣bradorâ in the west Indies, in regard of the accurate and elaborate compo∣sition. The fourth may be fitly termed Promontorium bonae spei,Cape of good hope. not so much in respect of the hopefull parts of the speaker, as the subject of his discourse, which was the promise of our Saviour, I will ease you. This indeed is Caput bonae spei, the only Cape of good hope. If these allusions seem defective, and not so apposite; as before I searched the land, so now I will the sea for fitter, and the fittest of all seem to mee to be these foure seas: 1. Rubrum, 2. Orientale. 3. Mediterraneum. 4. Pacificum. The first, because it ran all upon the bloudy passion of our Saviour, I liken to the read sea. The second I compare to the orientall Ocean, not onely in respect of the immensity of matter in it, depth of the authors judgment, and rare pearles of wit and art; but especially, because Extulit Oceano caput aureus igniferum sol. because out of this Easterne Ocean we saw the Sun of righteousnes, Christ Jesus arising. The third, because it interveyned between the former & the latter sea, and passed through the whole continent in a manner of Divinity, I call the Mediterranean or mid-land sea. The fourth, for the equall current of it, but especially for the subject and matter, resembleth mare del zur, commonly called Pacificum: for his whole discourse tended to this, that though the life of a Christian be a sea, yet that it is so calmed by Christs promise, I will ease you, that to every childe of God in the end it proves mare pacificum. My peace I give unto you,The still sea. be not trou∣bled, nor feare; Et si vultis accipere, these judicious and methodicall Ser∣mons, foure in number, are the foure rowes in Aarons breast-plate of judge∣ment, the jewels are their precious doctrines, the imbossments of gold, in which these jewels were set, were their texts of Scripture: Sed ubi spiritua∣lis tabernaculiVincent. Le∣rin. advers. haer. Bezaliel, qui pretiosas divini dogmatis gemmas exculperet fi∣deliter, adornaret sapienter, adjiceret gratiam, splendorem, venustatem? I know not how it comes to passe, that as sometimes in Israel, though there were much metall, yet no Smith; so at this time in this famous University, though we have store of jewels, yet there is none who will professe him∣self in this kind a Jeweller. If the true reason hereof be the difficulty & dan∣ger of this work, wherein we fish as it were with a golden hook, Cujus jactu∣ra nullâ piscium capturâ compensari potest: then have all sorts of auditors great reason favourably to interpret their best endeavours, who for their sake not only undertake so great a taske, but hazzard so great a losse. If the Rehearser acquit himself never so well, what can he expect for all his pains
but the bare commendation of a good memory? but if he faile, not only his memory, but his judgement and discretion also are called in question. In which consideration, when authority first laid hands on mee, I drew backe with all my might, till the command for repeating being repeated againe and againe, in the end the power of authority more prevailed with mee, than the sense of mine owne infirmity; Adamas ferrum à magnete tractum ad se rapit vehementiùs, though the iron, as Agricola observeth, is drawn power∣fully by the load-stone; yet if a diamond be in place, the load-stone loseth his force. Artificiall memory, asLib. 3. Rhet. ad Heren. Constat artifi∣ciosa memoria ex locis & imaginibus. Cornificius saith, consisteth of images and places. We need not goe farre for them, we have them both in my Text, places, Ver. 17. Thou shalt set it full of places for stones; & images most resplendent in the Verses following: and very happy were I, if as here I have the names, so I had the naturall effects attributed to some of these jewels: for, 1. The Agat keepeth a man moist, saith Dioscorides. 2. The Beril sharpeneth the wit, saith Ystella. 3. The Carbuncle infuseth spirits, saith Barraeus. 4. The Chrysolite helpeth the breathing parts, saith Rueus. 5. The Emrald is good for the sight and memory, saith Vincentius. 6. The Onyx strengtheneth the whole body, saith Albertus. 7. The Saphir freeth a man from wrath and envie, saith Tostatus. but I perswade my self, that many of these authors, when they wrote these things, had an Amethyst on their fingers, the last jewell in the third row, in Hebrew called המלחא, from מלח.Buxtorf. epit. radic. heb. From a word signify∣ing to dreame, because they that weare it are much sub∣ject to dream∣ing. Amethystus lapis pretiosus, sic dictus, quòd gestantibus eum somnia inducit, and therefore leaving such incredulous relations toAben Ezra in Exod. 28.19. Rabbinicall and Philosophicall legends, in a warrantable Scripture phrase I will pray to Almighty God, to touch my tongue with a coale mentioned by theEsay 6.6, 7. Then flew one of the Sera∣phims unto me, having a coale in his hand, and he laid it upon my tongue. Prophet Esay, which S. Jerome interpreteth a Carbuncle, that I may enflame the hearts of this great assembly with a zeale of his glory, and both now, & whensoever I am to speak to the edi∣fication of his people; so to furnish mee with materialls, and assist mee in laying them, that upon the true foundation Christ Jesus, I may build not hay and stubble, but gold, silver, and precious stones, such as shine in my Text; which I divide according to the foure rowes into foure parts. THE FIRST ROW. And in the first row a Ruby, a Topaze, and an Emrald. WHether the Ruby fit not the modesty of the Speaker; the Topaze, quae sola gemmarum limam sentit, his limate and polished stile; the Emrald the fresh and green verdour of his sentences, I leave to your lear∣ned censures: sure I am, the green and ruddy stones, some of them genera∣ted in the red sea, lively set forth the green wounds and bloudy passion of the worlds Redeemer, the subject of his discourse. The Ruby hath a perfect colour of flesh, whence it is called in Latine Carneolus; but with a lustre and
resplendency farre above the nature of flesh. What fitter embleme of the rayes of divine majesty shining in the flesh of our Saviour? which was the argument of the Preachers first part. This Ruby nubeculâ quâdam offunde∣batur (as the naturall) to wit, in his passion, and then changed colour, and re∣sembled the other two gems, death displaying its colours in his flesh, which he suffered to pay the wages of sinne for us; which was the scope of his lat∣ter observations. The imbossment of gold, in which these gems of divine doctrine were set, was his Text taken out of JOHN 11.50. It is expedient for us, that one man should dye for the people.The first Ser∣mon preached on Good-friday by Master Oz∣borstone Stu∣dent of Christ-Church. BEhold, I bring you a prophesie, but of no Prophet; I present you lying ma∣lice speaking truth, unwittingly, unwillingly, and savage cruelty provi∣ding a salve to cure the wounds of all mankind. Out of one fountain bit∣ter and sweet, out of one field tares and wheat, out of one mouth proceeds cursing and blessing. Behold an ambitious simoniacall Priest of the Romane constituti∣on, and that but for a yeer, vaunt over him that is a Priest for ever after the or∣der of Melchizedek. Behold bloudy Caiphas consulting, nay determining to put Christ to death, not for any fault of his, but because it was profitable to the Priests (it is expedient for us): yet doth hee colour his bloud-thirsty appetite with a varnish of common good: If wee let him alone, all men will beleeve in him, and beleeving him to be a God, will advance him to be a King, & the Ro∣mans will come & take away this place and our Nation. He is but one man, what is the bloud of one man to the quiet of a publike state? Melius est ut pereat unus, quàm unitas, let one man dye, that the whole Nation perish not. This is Caiphas his meaning: vouchsafe we a look to it, before we consider the mean∣ing of a much better spirit. Solomon his Lilly is most beautifull among thornes. The Rose, sayes Plutarch, is never so fragrant, as when it is planted by the Nettle: the doctrine of the Holy Ghost seemeth never more excellent, than when it is compared with the doctrine of Divels. It is expedient he should dye, he saith not it is just or lawfull: Bonum commodis non honestate metitur. Caiphas profit is become the rule of justice; in whose hands now it is not only to judge according to the rule of law, but to over-rule the law also. In imitation of whom I verily thinke it was, that Clemens the fifth being demanded how the Templer Knights might be cut off, made this answer, Si non licet per viam ju∣stitiae, licet saltem per viam expedientiae. But if it be profitable, to whom, cui bono? to whom is it so? to us: now hee speakes like himselfe. To S. Paul all things were lawfull, yet many things did not seem expedient: to Caiphas that is expedient which is not lawfull. But shall a just innocent man, a Prophet, nay more than hee that was more than a Prophet, lose his life for nothing but your commodity? the answer is, that though he be all these, yet in a manner he is but unus, one man, and we are many; better it were that he suffer a mischiefe, than we an inconvenience; therefore be his quality what it may be, let him dye. Ne saevi magne Sacerdos: Let not the high Priest be angry; will nothing but his death appease you? You have a guard, keep him sure, manacle his hands, fetter his feet, only spare his life, bring not his bloud upon your head. Tush, it is for our profit, His bloud
be upon us. Thus crudelitas vertitur in voluptatem, & jam occidere homi∣nem juvat, it was meat & drink to them to spill the bloud of Christ Jesus; and being pleased to consider him but as a man, they trampled on him as a worme and no man.Ystel. in Exod. Behold here in another sense Caiphas a bloudy Ruby; yet, as the Rubies about Egypt aureâ bracteâ sublinuntur, so hath he gold foyle Scripture in his mouth, the words of the Holy Ghost, who not only out of the mouth of babes and sucklings will have his praise, out of the mouth of asses and brute beasts will have his power to be knowne; but also out of the mouth of reprobates and incarnate divels will have the same truth in the same words confirmed, which holy Prophets, and the holy Spirit, by which they spake, would have revealed. For not onely holy men (as the Prea∣cher observed) but sometimes also unholy men speake as they are moved by the Holy Ghost: Agit Spiritus Dei, & per bonos, & per malos, & per scientes, & per nescientes quod agendum novit, & statuit; but in a different manner. The Holy Ghost so touched the hearts of holy Prophets, that their hearts endi∣ting this matter of Christs passion, their tongues became the pen of ready writers: but on the contrary, as Caiphas did honour God with his lips, while his heart was farre from him; so (saith Saint Chrysostome) the Spirit of God touched his lips, but came not neere his heart. (It is expedient.) In the exposition of Caiphas, the meaning is, it is good for us pretending common good, to kill Jesus; but the sense of the Holy Ghost is, that the precious death of our Saviour would be expedient for us, and his alone bloud once shed for his people an all-sufficient ransome for their soules. Expedient it was, and behoovefull in the first place, that he who should sa∣tisfie for sinne (the wages whereof is death) should bee a man subject to death. Secondly, that he should dye. Thirdly, inasmuch as with respect to his people he became a man subject to death; so that hee should in the end lay downe his life for the people. Fourthly, that he should be sufficient by his alone death to satis∣fie in their behalfe, for whom he dyed. Lastly, we must enquire whether the pro∣fit of his passion be such as extendeth to our selves, or not; we shall find it doth: for so are the words of the Text, It is expedient for us. Expedient it was that the Saviour of man should be a man, Ecce homo, be∣hold he is so: for comming to save man, suscepit naturam quam judicavit sal∣vandam, he became in all things, sinne only excepted, like unto us. It was fit it should be so; for if the Deity had opposed it selfe, non tam ratio quàm potestas Diabolum vicisset, what mystery had there bin for God to vanquish the Divell? how should the Scripture have bin fulfilled, The seed of the woman shall breake the Serpents head? yet there is an experiment be∣yond all this, Experiar Deus hic discrimine aperto an sit mortalis, saith the spirituall Lycaon; if hee carry about with him , a body subject to dissolution, doubtlesse hee is a man. Thus therefore that hee might shew himselfe a man, it was expedient that hee should die. Is this thy reward, O sweet Saviour, for stouping thine infinite majesty so low as to become earth, and thirty three yeeres to converse amongst
us, must thou dye? It must bee so, yet not for any necessity of justice in respect of himselfe; for never Lambe more innocent: nor of con∣straint; for at the very time of his apprehension, when hee had lesse than twelve Apostles, hee had more than twelve Legions of Angels at his becke; at the breath of his mouth, the majesty of his counte∣nance, the force of those his words, I am hee, a whole troupe of his persecuters fell backwards: but it must bee so, because the determi∣nation of the Trinity, and the conformity of his owne will thereunto will have it so: Oblatus est quia voluit (saith the Prophet:) I lay down my life (saith himselfe:) Yea, Caiphas said as much in effect, It is meet, not that one should be put to death, but that he should dye: Mori infirmi∣tatis est, sic mori virtutis infinitae. There wanted not other meanes to redeeme man, but , it was meet, that by the death of the Sonne of God wee should bee redeemed: Sanguine quaerendi reditus animâque litandum. No escaping the stroake of the Angel, but by sprinkling the Lambes life bloud: no meanes to returne from exile, till the death of the high Priest. Must hee dye then? and are the Scriptures so strait in this point? O death, how bitter is thy remembrance? witnesse our Saviour: Si fieri potest, transeat hic calix; but sith for the reasons before named that was neither possible nor expedient, sith dye hee must, what death doth the Holy Ghost thinke to bee most expedient? If hee may not yeeld to nature, as a ripe apple falleth from the tree, but must be plucked thence, there are deaths no lesse honourable than violent: shall he dye an honourable death? No, hee must bee reckoned among the malefactors, and dye a shame∣full death. In shamefull deaths there is a kind of , rid him quickly out of his paine: Misericordiae genus est citò occidere. No, that was not expedient, Feri ut se sentiat mori, it was expedient that hee should dye a te∣dious and most painfull death, wherein a tract of lingering misery and la∣sting torment was to bee endured: What death is that? I need not ampli∣fie; even by the testimony of the Holy Ghost the death of the Crosse was for the torture most grievous, for the shame most infamous: He humbled him∣selfe, and became obedient unto death. Could his humility goe on one step further? Yes, one step, even to the death of the Crosse, that is a death beyond death; the utmost and highest of all punishments, saith Ulpian: Having in it the extent of torture, saith Apuleius: The quintessence of cruelty, saith the Roman Oratour. It is not amisse to know the manner of the execution of this death. First, after sentence given, the prisoner was whipped, then forced to carry his Crosse to the place of execution, there in the most tender and sinewie parts of the body nailed to the Crosse, then lifted up into the ayre, there with cruell mercy for a long while preserved alive; after all this, when cruelty was satisfied with bloud, for the close of all, his joynts were broken, and his soule beat out of his body. This was part of his paine; I say part, I cannot expresse the whole, the shame was much more: Infoelix Lignum, saith Seneca truly,
and unhappy: for untill this time the curse of God was upon him that was hanged. It is a trespasse to bind, 'tis wickednes to beat, it is murder to kill: Quid dicam in crucem tollere? Look we to the originall, it was first devised by Tarquinius, as the most infamous punishment of all, against such as laid violent hands upon themselves. Look we to the use of it, they accounted it a slaves, nay a dogs death; for in memory that the Dogge slept when the Geese defended the Capitoll, every yeer in great solemnity they carried a Goose in triumph, softly laid upon a rich carpet, and a Dogge hanging upon a crosse. Looke wee to the concomitancy, Non solent suspensi lugeri, saith the Civilian, no teare was wont to be shed for such as were crucified. And was it expedient that our Savi∣our should dye this death? It was expedient, that the prophesie of Esay might be verified, We saw him made as the basest of men; and of David, A scorne of men, and the out-cast of the people; and of himselfe, They shall deliver him to the Gentiles, to mock, scourge, and crucifie him. These were prophe∣sies that it should be so; yet we want a prophesie that saith, It is expedient: That we doe not, Oportet filium hominis exaltari, ut Moses extulit Serpentem; for that Serpent, lifted up to cure all that looked upon it, was an embleme of Christ. Thus himselfe, who was a high Priest for ever, did prophesie of himselfe, being now both priest and sacrifice. It was expedient that he should dye, & thus dye: to be forsaken of his friends, falsly accused by his enemies, to be sold like a slave, mocked like a foole, spit upon like a made man, whipt like a theefe, crucified like a traitour; make up a misery, that the sun shamed, the earth trem∣bled to behold it: yet it was expedient, it must be done, God hath said it. Mee thinkes, I heare our Saviour say in this baptisme of bloud, as he said in his bap∣tisme of water, Thus it becommeth us to fulfill all righteousnes, and thus it became him, for whom, & by whom are all things, to consecrate the Prince of our salvation through afflictions. The prophesies had said it, it should be so, and it was expedient that he to whom they pointed should fulfill them, that so in fulness of truth he might take his leave of the crosse, and say, Consum∣matum est, those things which were written of mee have an end. All this while we see not the reason why he should be thus tormented: Goe to Pilate, his answer will be, I am innocent of the bloud of this man: Enquire you of the Scribes and Pharisees, their answer will be, We have a law, and by this law he must dye, because he made himselfe the Son of God. This was no fault, he was so, and therefore without robbery or blasphemy might both think and declare himselfe to be so. Goe wee further, from popular Pilate and the cruell Jewes to God himselfe, and though we be but dust and ashes, for the knowledge of this truth presume we to aske, Cur fecisti filio sic? How may it stand with thy justice that he should dye, in whom there was found no fault wor∣thy death, nay no fault at all? the unswer is, Expedit mori pro populo: yet, O Lord, wilt thou slay the righteous with the wicked? nay, which is more, wilt thou slay the righteous, and spare the wicked? nay, which is yet more, wilt thou slay the righteous for the wicked? shall not the Judge of all the world doe right? God cannot chuse but do right, the wages of sin is death; though he have not sinned, the people have. If the principall debtour cannot pay, the surety must; if the prisoner dare not appeare, the baile must: Christ was the surety, the baile of the people, and so God might permit his justice against sin, to take hold on him, and hee must dye for the people, if he will not have the people dye.
It being knowne that he dyed for the people, it is worth the while to know who these people were, for whom he dyed. Caiphas had respect to the Jewes on¦ly, and their temporall good; but the Holy Ghost intended the spirituall good of the Jewes primarily, though not of them alone: but of the people also through the world. But is it possible, that of all people he should dye for the Jewes? Ab ipsis, & pro ipsis? these were they that spit upon him, whipped him, smote him on the face, crowned him with thornes, tare him with nailes; these were they, who in the act of his bitter passion, when his soule bereft of all comfort, laden with the sinne of all the world, and fiercenesse of his Fathers wrath, enforced from him that speech, than which the world never heard a more lamentable, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee? then in stead of comfort they reviled him, If thou be the Son of God, come downe from the crosse, all this notwithstanding though they persecuted him, hee loved them; though they cryed Away with him, he dyed for them, & at his death prayed for them: Father, forgive, and pleaded for them, they know not what they doe; and wept for them, offering supplications in their behalfe with prayers & strong cries. Greater love than this can no man shew, to lay downe his life for his friend: yet thou, O blessed Saviour, art a patterne of greater love, laying downe thy life for this people whilest they were thine enemies; but not for this peo∣ple only, (the Holy Ghost so speakes) O Lord, we were thine enemies as well as they, and whilest we were thine enemies, we were reconciled to God the Father by the precious death of thee his Son. For the Scripture setteth forth his love to us, that whilest we were yet sinners he dyed for us. He for us, alone for us all: the same spirit which set before him expedit mo∣ri, did sweeten the brim of that sowre cup with this promise, that when hee should make his soule an offering for sin, hee should see his seed: that as the whole earth was planted, so it might be redeemed by one bloud; as by one of∣fence condemnation seized upon all, so by the justification of one, the bene∣fit might redound unto all to the justification of life. And this bloud thirsty Caiphas unwittingly intimated, saying, Expedit unum mori pro populo. If one, and he then dead could do thus much, what can he not do now, now that he liveth for ever? He trod the wine-presse alone, neither is there salvation in any other. S. Stephen was stoned, S. Paul beheaded, Nunquid pro nobis? No, it cost more than so, it is done to their hands, there is one, who by the ob∣lation of himselfe alone once offered, hath made a perfect and sufficient sa∣crifice for the sins of the whole world. And that whilest it is a world: for our Saviour, that stood in the gap betwixt Gods wrath & us, catching the blow in his own body, hath by his bloud purcha∣sed an eternal redemption; every one that beleeveth in him shal not perish, but have life everlasting. In the number of which beleevers if we be, then is the fruit of his meritorious passion extended to us, we may challenge our inte∣rest therein; and in our persons the Prophet speaketh, He bare our infirmities and carried our sorrowes, he was wounded for our transgressions, the cha∣stisement of our peace was upon him, and by his stripes are we healed. Which great benefit, as it is our bounden duty to remember at all times, so this time, this day Vivaciorem animi sensum, & puriorem mentis exigit intuitum, recursus temporis, & textus lectionis, as S. Leo speaketh, The an∣nuall recourse of the day, and this text fitted to it, calleth to our minde the
worke wrought, & the means by which it was wrought on this day: to him a day of wrath, of darknesse, of blacknesse, & heavie vengeance; but to us a good day, a good Friday, a day of deliverance & freedome, a day of jubilee and tri∣umph. For as on this day by the power of his Crosse were we delivered from the sting of sin, and tyranny of Satan, so that whereas we might for ever have sung that mournfull Elegy, O wretched men that we are, who shal deliver us from death & hell? we are now enabled to insult over both, O death, where is thy sting? O hell, where is thy victory? Which victory of our Saviour, and ours through him so dearly purchased, when we call to mind, let us consider withall, that as the cause of this conflict on his part was his love to us; so on our parts it was the hainousness of our sinne, not otherwise to be expiated than by his death. And as the first ought to raise us up to give annuall, daily, & continuall thankes to him, who did and suffered so much for us; so the second should withhold us, & keep us back from sin: that since our Saviour dyed for our sin, we should dye to sin, & rather dye than sin. This bloud once shed is good to us; Expedit nobis, if to faith in that bloud we joyn a life beseeming Christianity: but if by our crying sins & trespasses we crucifie him againe, we make even that bloud, which of it selfe speaketh for us better things than the bloud of Abel, in stead of pardon to cry for vengeance against us. Let us therfore looke up to him the author and finisher of our salvation, be∣seeching him, who with the bloud of his passion clave rockes & stones asunder, with the same bloud, which is not yet nor ever will be dry, to mollifie and soften our hard hearts, that seriously considering the hainousnesse of our sins, which put him to death, and his unexpressible & unconceivable love, that for us he would dye the death, even the death of the Crosse; we may in token of our thankfulness endeavour to offer up our soules and bodies as a reasonable sacrifice to him that offered himselfe a sacrifice for us, and now sitteth at the right hand of God; to this end, that where he our Redeemer is, there wee his people and dearest purchase may be for ever. THE SECOND ROW. And in the second row thou shalt set a Carbuncle, a Saphir, and a Diamond. THat the second Speaker, that sweet singer of Israel, whose ditty was, A∣wake, & sing ye that sleep in dust, made (according to my Text) a row, or Canticum graduum, a Psalme of ascents or degrees, I cannot but even in a du∣ty of thankfulnesse acknowledge, for the help of memory I received from it: had not he made a row, that is, digested & disposed his matter in excellent order, I should never have bin able to present to you the jewels set in this row, which are all (as you see) most orient. Of all red stones the Carbuncle, of all blew the Saphir,Plin. nat. hist. l. 37. of all simply the Diamond hath been ever held in highest esteem: Maximum in rebus humanis pretium adamas habet, non tan∣tum inter gemmas.Comment. in Esay. Carbunculus (saith S. Jerome) videtur mihi sermo doctri∣nae, qui fugato errore tenebrarum illuminat corda credentium, hic est quem u∣nus de Seraphim tulit farcipe comprehensum ad Esayae labra purganda. Whe∣ther this second Preacher (in S. Pauls phrase a Prophet) his tongue were not
touched with such a coale, I referre my selfe to your hearts and consciences, Nonne ardebat cor vestrûm in vobis, cùm exponeret vobis Scripturas? The se∣cond jewel was a Saphir, according to the Hebrew derivation from Sepher, a booke, wherein we may reade both the doctrine and graces of the second Speaker: Hic lapis (ut perhibent) educit corpore vinctos, saith Vincentius; and was not his doctrine a Jayle-delivery of all deaths pri∣soners? It is a constant tradition among the Rabbins, that the tables of stone,Bellar. l. 2. de Verb. Dei. wherein the ten Commandements were written with the finger of God, were of Saphir. For although Pliny affirmeth,Nat. hist. l. 37. that the Saphir is a stone alto∣gether unfit for sculpture, yet this can be no just exception against this tra∣dition, sith the engraving of the ten Commandements was done by the fin∣ger of God above nature. Moreover, it is cleare out of this Text, that the name of one of the Patriarchs was written in the Saphir. Such a Saphir was the second Speaker, having the Lawes of God imprinted in his heart. The third jewell is a Diamond, in Hebrew called Jahalom, because it breaketh all o∣ther stones; in Greek Adamas, that is, unconquerable, because it can neither be broken by the hammer, nor consumed in the fire: nay, the fire (saith Ze∣nocrates) hath not so much power as to stain the colour, much lesse impeach the substance of this stone. Call to mind among the vertues of a Magistrate, conspicuous in this divine Oratour, his unconquerable courage & unstained integrity, and the comparison is already made. Pliny reporteth, Adamantem sideritem alio Adamante perforari: thinke you not, that if a man could have a heart as hard as the Adamant, this Adamant, pointed with sacred eloquence, could breake it and make it contrite? Lastly, Pliny addeth, that the Dia∣mond is a soveraign remedy against poyson, Et ideò regibus charissimus, iis∣que paucis cognitus, in high esteem with Princes: if, as our gracious Sove∣raigne hath, so all Christian Princes had such Diamonds as this; if such Preachers were their eare-rings, they should be free from the danger of all poysoned and hereticall doctrine. If as the stones placed in the second row agree with the gifts of the Spea∣ker, so they sort as well with the doctrines of his Text, I am sure you wil all say, that this second order of stones is not out of order. A most remarkable story of the Carbuncle we have, that cast in the fire among live coals, it see∣meth to have no grace in it; but quench the other coals with water, & it shi∣neth more gloriously in the ashes than ever before: so our Saviour in the brunt of his passion, while he was heat by the fire-brands of hell, Scribes & Phari∣sees, Jewes & Romans, seemed to be dead, and lose all his colour & beauty, nay, was indeed dead according to his humane nature (his soule being seve∣red from his body:) but after the consummation of his passion, and the ex∣tinction of the fiery rage of his persecuters with his bloud, in his resurrecti∣on he shewed himself a most glorious Carbuncle, shining in majesty, & burn∣ing in love. After his resurrection, in the day of his ascension, hee taketh pos∣session of his throne in heaven, which,Chap. 1. V. 26. in Ezekiel is said to bee like a Saphir stone, & now sitting at the right hand of God the Father, having conquered sin, death, & hell, & made all his enemies his footstoole, he is become the only true orient Diamond in the world: whether you take the name from the Greek ἄδαμασ, ab ά & δαμαω, or the Hebrew םלהי from םלה, being invin∣cible
himselfe, and overcomming all adverse power, breaking his obstinate enemies in pieces, like a potters vessell, with a rod of iron. The embossment of gold, in which these gems of divine doctrine were set, was his Text taken out of A Sermon preached by Doctor John King then Dean of Christ-Church, and Vicechancellor of the Universi∣ty of Oxford, afterwards Lord Bishop of London, upon Easter day in Saint Peters Church in Ox∣ford. ESAY 26.19. Thy dead men shall live together, with my body shall they rise: awake and sing yee that dwell in dust; for the dew is as the dew of herbes, and the earth shall cast up her dead. IT would aske the labour of an houre to settle this one only member, I finde such a Babel of tongues at odds about so few words. Variae lectio∣nes.Whereas we reade ter∣ra projiciet, or ejiciet, the earth shall cast up or bring forth, as it doth her herbs and winter prisoners, Junius hath, Dejecisti in terram, Castalio, terram demoliris, the Seventy, Terra cadet, S. Jerome, Dejicies in terram, the Chal∣dee paraphrase, Trades in infernum: and for mortuos, in Hebrew Rephaim, from a word signifying to cure, per antiphrasin the Seventy reade , the wicked or ungodly; S. Jerome, Gigantes, stout and robustious against God. But to set you in a right and inoffensive way, I reduce almost an infinity of distracti∣ons to two heads. For all of them either speak of the resurrection of the dead in∣definitely, which they doe that say, Terra ejiciet, to wit, postquam in terram dejecisti. For the earth cannot cast up that it hath not: and, Manium terram demoliris; or of the destruction of the wicked, one only species of the dead, which the Seventy call impios, others Giants, mighty to transgresse; both senses, as the Northern and Southern rivers running from contrary points meet in the Oce∣an; so these from sundry and discrepant conceits run into one common place of the generall resurrection, save that the latter adde a straine to the former of Gods vengeance, and wrath prepared for the wicked. Sense twofold.Thus having set the letters of my Text together, & accorded the words, it re∣maineth that their scope and intent be freed from question. There is not one of the learned Scribes, old or new, Jew or Christian, whose spirit and pen hath not fallen upon one of these two senses (viz.) that the Prophet either speaketh of the resurrection of the dead at the last day, or of the restitution and enlargement of the people from their present straights: in which (say they) calamity is a kind of death, captivity as the grave, Gods people as the seed in the ground, Gods grace and favour as the comfortable dew, to revive and restore them to their wonted being. Of these two companies some goe after the literall grammaticall sense, lending not so much as the cast of their eye toward the allegory, as Strigelius, Clarius, Brentius: Others on the other side of the banke standing for the sha∣dowed resurrection, are not so peremptory; but si quis aliter sentire mavult, per me liber hoc faciat: and Calvin himself in his commentary layes out as it were a lot, as well for the true as the typicall resurrection: Falluntur Christiani, qui ad extremum judicium restringunt, Prophetatotum Christi regnum ab ini∣tio ad finem usque complectitur. Aquinas equally joyneth them both; Hìc est propositio resurrectionis, vel corporalis in die novissimo, vel à miseriâ capti∣vitatis. To conclude then, as in the 37. chapter of Ezekiel the resurrection of the dead is brought in as an argument by God himselfe, to ascertaine the people of their delivery from thraldome; an argument à majore ad minus: Can he raise and revive the dead? and can he not much more restore the distressed? yet I will
be bold to say, that the proper resurrection of the dead, without the vaile of a me∣taphor in the hardest construction that can be made of the words, is either the scope of the Prophet, or his proofe, his intent or his argument, his maine and principal conclusion, or his strongest principle to demonstrate his conclusion. And Mr. Gualter giveth a good reason why all other comforts are sealed up with this doctrine and promise of the universall resurrection, Quòd nulla alia sit certa & solida consolatio, because all other calmes are temporary, fluxe and mutable, from which there are recidivations and relapses into subsequent stormes. By this time I am secure, that no mist of an allegory can so trouble or dimme your eyes, but that you clearly behold in the true glasse of my Text a faire and un∣doubted image of the resurrection of the dead; which being the proper subject of this feast, I hope I have sufficiently warranted the choice of my theame, and so I proceed to the explication. Thy dead shall live, with my body shall they rise, awake and sing,Analysis Tex∣tus, partium ordo & divi∣sio. &c. Yee see how many members there are in the body of my Text; yet in resolution and in issue they are all but one: It is a totum similare. As the whole water of the sea is but water, and yet every drop of the sea is water too; so the whole bulke and shocke of my Text is the resurrection, and yet every part and parcell thereof is the resurrection also: for marke the words, Vivent, resurgent, evigilabunt, cantabunt, germinabunt, projicientur. mortui, cadaver, pulvis, habitatores pulveris, herbae, inferi seu manes. What is this in the whole composition, what in every limb & joynt apari, but the ecchoing and resounding from one to the other the doctrine of the resurrection? To omit (besides all these which have their tabernacle in the sun, and are evi∣dent and apert professions thereof) many secret & minerall arguments couch∣ed in the bowels and bosome of my Text, which shall be extracted in their due time. Bees are not so like Bees, but that there are individuall differences be∣tween them; neither are the members of my Text so like, but that they may bee distinguished. Thus then by way of objection and answer you may perceive their distinction and order, as also the maine scope to which they tend. Doth any object, Nihil est post mortem, death is an utter extinction? It is answered, not so: for thy dead shall live. Doth he goe on and say, they may live in their spirits, which never dye; but what for their bodies? It is answered, With my body shall they rise. Rise, doe you say? but by what authority? what shall be the instrument and meanes thereof? The shrill sound of the last Trump awaking them out of their sleep, and the voice of God, Awake yee that dwell in dust. Awake they may and rise, but to no lesse wretchednesse and misery than be∣fore: Answer, They shall awake and sing; it shall be a triumphant and joyfull resurrection. Yea, but shew us any signe thereof, and we will beleeve it: Answer, Thy dew is the dew of herbs; nature hath printed this truth in every garden thou walkest in. Lastly, if they say the earth hath devoured our bodies, how shall we then arise? It is answered, Terra projiciet, the earth shall bee driven to dis∣gorge and cast them up againe. There are degrees and ascents in my Text: 1. Vivent may be in soule; but 2. Resurgent must be in body. 3. Evigilabunt may be to sorrow; but 4. Canta∣bunt must be to joy. 5. Ros herbarum is but a light from nature; but 6. Terra projiciet is an act of irrisistible compulsory power. The first is the fundamen∣tall
proposition, and sheweth the entity, what is and shall be, Vivent mor∣tui. The second is exposition, and sheweth the manner, Resurgent. The third is confirmation, and sheweth the efficiency, Evigilabunt. The fourth is congratula∣tion, and sheweth the quality, Cantabunt. The fifth is illustration, and sheweth the probability, Ros herbarum. The sixth and last is conclusion, and sheweth the necessity, Terra projiciet. There is a time of gathering, and a time of scatte∣ring. These sixe, either members or remarkable points and joynts of my Text, hitherto severed, sith the Prophet hath construed together, I will reduce to three combinations, and so handle them. The 1. Vivent and resurgent. 2. Evigilate and cantate. 3. Ros tuus and terra projiciet. The first combination or conjugation is Vivent and Resurgent. There is a difference between them; the former is partiall & incompleat, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were alive (as is proved by our Saviours argument: Deus non est Deus mortuorum, sed viventium) when their bodies were not living; the lat∣ter is totall and absolute, and addeth the life of the body to the life of the soule.  is of that whereof before there was  they shal live therfore & rise, but who? Mortui, the dead; the dead is the common genus & sagena, that com∣prehends all sorts good and bad: Moritur pariter doctus & indoctus, in hoc tertio we all agree. In the first and archetypall world, when one man was as nine men, had nine mens ages, yet the end & period of all their acts is, Et mor∣tuus est: and whatsoever the chronicles of the Kings of Judah and Israel omit besides, they omit not this, Et dormivit cum patribus. Death is that Syncope or Elision, that cutteth not out letters or leaves, but lives; and which not Gram∣mar, but nature shall cause us to understand: —Mors ultima linea rerum, our whole life being but linea circumducta rediens ad idem punctum, à pul∣vere ad pulverem, the assured period and full point after all other points, pawses, sections and intersections, changes and vicissitudes of this mortall life: after all our eatings and drinkings the symbolum or shot that must be paid, the centre, to which our corruptible body, which presseth downe the soule, doth by its weight and pronenesse forcibly tend. Mortui. Consider once for all the subject of this clause, and all the proposition, & how it climbeth; first mortui: secondly, cadaver: thirdly, pulvis: fourthly, ha∣bitatores pulveris: fifthly, inferi and manes; free Denizons among the dead, such as might say to corruption, thou art our father; and to wormes & dust, yee are our brothers and sisters. Yet these dead carkasses, carrion, dust, inve∣terate dust, netherlanders, shall live and rise: Non obstat potentiae Dei diu∣turna putredo, walke but a pace or two backward, yee shall find a negative to this affirmative, the dead shall not live. Is there yea and nay in the Holy Ghost? Yea, and both true. For elucidation whereof take the rule of Brentius in his Nominibus, meum & tuum ita est tota vis concionis: Thy dead shall rise, that is, the Lords dead, either mortui propter Dominum, as Martyrs; or in Domino, as all beleevers; or quorum tota vita martyrium, whether they live or dye they are the Lords: Interfecti mei in some readings, in the genuine cadaver meum, the dead being, or which are my body, and then by collection,
as Junius well observeth, cadavera mea quoque, all the bodies of my Saints, which are as it were mine, because they belong to my mysticall body. Now then when it was said Mortui non resurgent, Mortui was put simply, and with∣out addition, as Hyperius saith: but in these propositions mortui vivent, ca∣daver resurget, you have a specificall difference, not omnes mortui, but tui, that is, Gods: cadaver, non omne, sed meum, that is, Christs: opposite where∣unto are mortui Satanae, & cadaver Antichristi. Hence commeth that seeming antilogie, or contradictio linguarum, strife of tongues, Resurgent, non re∣surgent, they shall, they shall not rise. But shall not all live, and rise againe? Doubtlesse they shall, the righteous in a right and reall acception: their life is a life indeed, vitall, immortall, Angelicall, nourished at the tree and foun∣taine of life, animated and perpetuated from the Lord of life, and they rise as the morning Sunne fairer and fairer, to a glorious, joyfull, incorruptible, and celestiall resurrection. Non sic impii, non sic, they live, or rather dye a death, and that the second, and that second a thousand fold; or rather they live a life, a terme without terme, of beeing and not being, corrupting and not ceasing, burning and not consuming: Ignis eorum non interit, they shall never be able to extinguish their fire, nor their fire them; absumit ut servet, servat ut cru∣ciet, the Salamanders of hell fire are kept in torment and vexation for ever∣more: and they rise, ut lapsu graviore ruant; as Jezebel was mounted to the window to be cast downe to the dogs: as Herod to his throne, for a more wofull and spectable ruine: as Lucifer, or rather Tenebrifer (as Bernard calleth him) to the side of the mountaine, for a more astonishable confusion. Our Saviour knits up both in two words: Some shall rise to the resurrection of life, there is the true vivent & resurgent; some to the resurrection of condemnation, there is the opposite. The second combination is Evigilate & cantate: yee shall observe in this and divers other passages in this Prophet divers interlocutions, prosopopeia's, and changing of persons. First, here the Prophet speaketh to God, or God to Christ, Thy dead shall live: Secondly, Christ to his Father, With my body shall they rise: Thirdly, here is Gods apostrophe to the dead, Awake and sing: Fourthly, the answer of the dead to God, Ros tuus, that is, quem tu irrorasti; or Gods apo∣strophe to his Church, Ros tuus, id est, qui super te cadet, O Ecclesia mea: Last of all, as it were the chorus and consent of all, Terra projiciet. Awake and sing are Gods alarum to the dead; habitatores pulveris, the houshold and meniall to dust. Now what voice, but the voice of God shall I say, like a Trumpet, or the roaring of a Lion, or the sound of many waters, or a clap or crack of thunder (all come too short) were able to enforme and actuate dust and rubble to audience? Loquor ad Dominum might they say with Abra∣ham, cùm sim pulvis & cinis? Howsoever pulvis & cinis in synthesi may doe it, I am sure pulvis & cinis in analysi cannot. Wee attempt not to rowze up those that are in a dead sleep without loud cries, but is any man so mad as to spend his voice, though a stentorian, and rend his throat against deafe rockes? Behold, God doth more than this by that powerfull instrument of his glorious Word, that gladius delphicus, that is more than Moses rod, wherewith hee wrought wonders: more than Jacobs staffe, wherewith hee prospered: more than Judah's scep∣ter, wherewith hee governed: more than Joseph's cup, wherewith hee
divined: I say, by that powerfull instrument, by which hee said Fiant to hea∣ven and earth, and they were created; Effata to deafe eares, and they were ope∣ned: Tace to the raging of the sea, and it was stilled: Obmutesce to the crying Divell, & he was silenced: Exi foras to the dead carkasses, & they came forth; by that doth he say to these dead and moultred in the earth, Awake and sing. Awake: but with what eyes to behold the light of heaven? when the windowes of their bodies have bin long since shut downe, their chrystall glasses of nature broken, their seers sunke into the holes of their head, clay dwelleth in their ta∣bernacles, and rottennesse in their circles, and the scorne of the Idoll in Baruch is fallen upon them, They cannot wipe the dust from their eyes. And sing. How shall they sing in a strange land? what be their instruments to sing to? where is their living harpe, and well tuned cymball? is it hung upon the willowes of Babylon, or rather tyed to the roofe of their mouth? where are their songs of praise and thanksgiving, which they sang in the land of the li∣ving? —Olim ego longas Cantando memini solitum consumere noctes; Nunc oblita mihi tot carmina. We are now laid in the land of forgetfulnesse, we have taken up and made our beds in the darke, our mouth is filled with gravell, and the slime of the pit sticketh in our throats: all this notwithstanding, they that are in their tombes & graves shall heare the voice of the Son of man, & earth, earth, earth in Je∣remy winnowed and boulted by death into the smallest dust, shall be effigiated and shaped anew into living men; Et ex his vermiculis & pulvere, saith Saint Bernard, instaurabuntur muri coelistis Jerusalem. Before I end this second combination, I remember that I noted unto you two things: first, the efficiency in the exuscitation, Awake; where forget not in the meane while to reserve for a latter meditation, that death by the phrase of my Text is a sleep: secondly, the quality; for sith they are willed to sing, that imports a joyfull resurrection: Musica in luctu importuna, and it must be a most joyfull resurrection, when such as shall partake thereof not only  (so the Seventy) but  (Aquilas) and  (Symmachus) and  (Theodotian.) Agreeable hereunto is that of our Saviour, Lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh. And here once more to the wicked we send libellum repudii: Non est vobis pars, ne{que} sors, yee may not consort with us in our blessed harmony, the voices of Ashdod and Canaan cannot tune together: to you belongeth, plangent tribus terrae, & tribulabitur ibi for∣tis, your singing shall be turned to sighing, your Tabrets & Shaumes into ever∣lasting beatings and hammerings on the anviles of your breast, your showting into howling and yelling, your clapping of hands into gnashing of teeth, your praising into blaspheming & cursing, & all your rejoycing shall be as the mour∣ning of Hadradrimmon in the valley of Megiddo; yea much more than of Hadradrimmon, because in the valley of Hinnon, is the lake and fornace of endlesse disconsolation. This Prophet shall conclude, Behold my servants shall rejoyce, and ye shall be ashamed: my servants shall sing for joy of heart, and ye shall cry for sorrow, and howle for vexation of mind. The third combination is, Ros tuus & terra projiciet, which giveth a double
proofe of the former doctrine: the one as it were of course, nature and common sense teacheth; the other of force, the creature must and shall accomplish it. Ter∣ra projiciet, that is, saith Rabbie David, Thou (O God) shalt command it. The learned in their Commentaries distinguish these proofes by a discrepancy of words, Elicere proper to the dew, and projicere fatall to the earth: the dew gently allureth, and calleth forth the herbes; so doth the Word & Spirit of God sweetly and easily bring up (may I say) these embryo's of death. But say that the earth withhold them, opposing her lockes and barres, and pleading perhaps the prescription of hundreds or thousands of yeeres, there is then place for projiciet, , angry and impatient though she be, reddet, non sua, she must cast them up, as the stomach a surfeit, and a woman an abortive fruit. See how God hath furnished us with all sorts of arguments: if Liber foederis will not serve, wee may reade in the booke of nature, or rather Bibliotheca librorum, described with a text hand, in faire and capitall letters, the resurrection of the dead. In∣terroga jumenta, saith Job: Interroga olera, saith my Prophet: Considera Lilia agri, saith our Saviour: looke into the fields, or sit still in your gardens, every one under his owne vine, and behold the growth of the plants and flowers, how after the cold of Winter, when the deadnesse of the yeere had blotted and blurred as it were the face of the earth, and the print of nature seemeth to bee quite razed out; yet (as Esay speaketh of the Oake and Elme) there is a sub∣stance in them, and by the comfort of the vernall sun-shine, and fatnesse of the clouds dropping on them, they garnish and cover the earth againe, as with the carpets of Egypt, and clothe it as with a Josephs coate, with all the variety of colours nature can invent. Nature is full of such demonstrations; I could bring you a band of creatures to strengthen this point. The bird of Arabia that riseth out of her owne ashes, the insecta animalia that spend the Winter season in a sha∣dow of death, the seed that lyeth and dyeth in the earth, our sleepings and a∣wakings, nights and dayes, winters and summers, autumnes and springs; but I leave them all, and cleave to the resemblance in my Text, Thy dew is as the dew of herbes; but when this dew and soft distillation is too weake to worke this effect, God hath a torrent and floud to doe it: Terra ejiciet, & contermina terrae, the sea that is married to the earth & lyeth in her armes & bosome. He shall say to the sea, Give; and to the earth, Restore, and all creatures in them, and in all the world besides that have devoured and swallowed the flesh of his chosen, when that day commeth, shall find that they have eaten morsels like aspes, and dranke a draught of deadly poyson, too strong and hard of digestion for their over weak stomachs. I end with the words of this Prophet, chapt. 66. Quis audivit unquam tale? quis vidit huic simile? nunquid parturiet terra in die unâ? & tota gens parietur simul? at this day it shall be so. Saphirus aureis punctis collucet, the best kind of Saphir,The recapitu∣lation with ad∣dition of ap∣pendant argu∣ments. saith the Natu∣ralist, hath something like points of gold in it: Such were these we now handled; give mee leave to use the Speakers phrase, though not in his sense, spare mee to recapitulate, or rather from recapitulation: for what have I done else all this while? Mee thinkes the sixe parts of this Text are like the six cities of refuge,Deut. 19. to which those that had slain, shall I say? nay, rather those that are slain may flye, to save shall I say? nay, but to recover and restore their lives: and they are all like the wheeles in Ezekiels vision, Rota in rotâ: or as the celestiall
Spheres one in the other, all moving alike to the same purpose: all striving for an Article of faith, one of the twelve flowers in the garland of our Creed, one of the twelve stones in the foundation of the holy City. I remember in the inhe∣ritance of Judah, among the rest there fell to their share sex civitates, & villae earum. Is there any such a desart so barren, so hopelesse, so waste, as death and the grave, desertion of life and beeing, when milke forsaketh the breasts, mar∣row the bones, bloud the veines, spirit the arteries, and the soule the body? yet when you are brought to this desart of desarts, you shall find sex civitates, & villas earum, six maine and eminent proofes of the resurrection, with as many lesse, like suburbs, granges, and appertinent villages. For first, Mortui vivent is a maine argument, grounded upon the Word and Promise, like civitas; but mortui tui is civitas & villa, a maine with an appendant argument drawne from the propriety that God hath in us. Secondly, Cadaver resurget is civitas, but cadaver meum is civitas & villa, a maine argument, with an appendant drawn from the society between the head & the members: he that raised Christ shall quicken us. Thirdly, Awake & sing are civitates, main arguments drawn from the command & power of God, who saith, Returne ye sons of Adam, and they return; but that the nature of the phrase should import a sleep, & no death, no privation of speech, but  pythagoricam, for a while, till God loosen the strings of the tongue, and put breath into the organ againe, these are civi∣tates & villae earum. Yet further, by Montanus his collection, pulvis & ha∣bitatores pulveris are villae, appendant arguments, the one from the matter of our creation, when we are at the worst we are but dust, from which our creation was, and why may not from thence our recreation be? the other from the terme of our abode, habitatio; which (saith he) is not of those that take up their man∣sion or long home, but of sojourners and factours, who continue for a while in forraine countries till they have dispatched their affaires. Adde lastly to all these the map of the whole earth, in every leafe of grasse describing the truth of this doctrine: —inscripti nomine vitae nascuntur flores— with those insufferable passions, pangs, and angariations, which the common mother to us all is put unto, till shee be rid of us, as the Whale of Jonas. A word of application, and it shall be the explication, which some very lear∣ned Expositors give upon cadaver meum. Wee have hitherto taken it to be the word of Christ to his Father; they say rather it is the word of the Prophet to his brethren, as if in effect hee had said, I preach to you no other do∣ctrine than that I beleeve my selfe: I teach that the dead shall live, and I am assured that with my body shall they rise. In which sense it is a pa∣rallel to that Magna Charta, that great and memorable record which Job transmitteth to all posterity, I know my Redeemer liveth, and I my selfe shall see him with these eyes, and no other; concionantur profani homi∣nes, the fashion of these worldly men is to prate of the life of the righteous, as Balaam of their death, like men in a trance, without sense or affection after it. The food of the soule is unto them as Barzillai his bodily food was unto him, they eate it without any appetite or rellish: (Hath thy servant any taste in that he eateth, saith he to David?) and the comforts of the Gospel to them as mu∣sicke
to him: (Can I heare the voice of singing men or women?) They be∣hold Canaan from the Mount, and the goodnesse of God afarre off: my mean∣ing is, they can talke of cadavera aliorum, but minde not, or at least hope not for cadaver meum: Odi sapientem qui sibi non sapit; qui sibi nequam, cui bonus? Nequam, saith Saint Bernard, is as much as nequaquam: all that this man knoweth or doth is as much as nothing, sith it availeth not him∣selfe; his case is like that of Tantalus, , as Plato saith, who hath apples at his lips, and water at his chinne, and yet pines for want. O unhappy man, goe to the prodigall childe, he came to his father with , and to that childe of the world, who came to our Saviour, Magister, dic fratri ut dividat mecum haereditatem, that is, suffer not a goodly inheri∣tance of a joyfull resurrection to be taken away by the violent, but thrust thou in for thy part among them, and when they shall say, corpora nostra, our bo∣dies shall rise, say thou with a fiduciall faith, cadaver meum, so shall my bo∣dy rise: and let every one that heareth mee this day say with the Prophet, Re∣member mee, O Lord, with the favour of thy people, and visit mee with thy salvation, that I may see the felicity of thy chosen, and rejoyce in the joy of thy people, and glory with thine inheritance. THE THIRD ROW. And in the third row a Turkeys, an Agate, and an Amethyst. FEw there are but know the Turkeys, tanquam ungues digitosque su∣os, wearing it usually in the pale of their rings. An excellent pro∣perty it is said to have of changing colour with the sick party that weareth it, and thereby expressing a kinde of sympathy. Rueus a great Lapidary a∣verres upon his owne knowledge as much: I was acquainted (saith hee) with a man whose Turkeys suddenly upon his death changed colour,Rueus de gem. Ego novi quendam quo mortuo Tur∣cois apparuit obscurior. and fell in the price. The Agate is a gemme of divers colours, spots and lines, the con∣curse whereof is sometimes so happy, that it representeth the lineaments of men, beasts, and other naturall bodies: Nunc formas rerum dans, nunc simulachra deorum. Of all, that of Pyrrhus was held by him in greatest estimation, of others in admiration, wherein the lines and spots were so drawne by nature,Plin. l. 37. c. 1. In Pyrrhi A∣chate novem Musae & Apol∣lo citharam te∣nens specta∣bantur, non ar∣te, sed sponte naturae ita di∣scurrentibus maculis, ut Mulis quoque singulis sua redderentur insignia. that Apollo with the nine Muses and their severall instruments were conspicuous in it. As for the Amethyst, it is a gemme of a middle colour, between wine and vio∣lets, so named either because applyed to the navell it is a remedy against drunkennesse, ab  steretico & , or (as saith Pliny) quod ad vini colorem accedens priusquam degustet in violam desinat. Of this third ranke of stones this may suffice for the application to the third Speaker, and his doctrine: himself, touching the infirmities of the Clergy & Laity, so feelingly resem∣bled the Turkeys, which the Jewelists make the emblem of compassion. His Sermon, for the variety of good learning in it, was a curious Agat, & most like
that of Pyrrhus above mentioned, wherein the nine Muses were pour∣trayed: the parts thereof were like the Amethyst, parti-coloured, part∣ly like wine, partly like violets: like wine in his matter of confuta∣tion, strong and searching; like violets in his exhortation, sweet and comfortable. His description of Christs bloudy death was like wine, the bloud of the grape; but of the resurrection like violets, the first-fruits of the Spring. The embossment of gold, wherein these gemmes of divine doctrine were set, was his Text taken out of A Sermon preached on Easter Mon∣day by Master Dunster, fel∣low of Magda∣len Colledge, and Proctor of the University of Oxford.APOC. 1.18. I am he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore, Amen, and have the keyes of hell and of death. THese words are a parcell of that booke, the reading whereof the ancient Church esteemed so profitable and needfull, that they en∣joyned all upon paine of excommunication to reade it once a yeere, between Easter and Whitsontide: Qui eam à Paschate ad Pentecosten non legerit, excommunicationis sententiam habeat. The words of my Text in speciall are verba pronuntiata verbi annuntiati, the words spoken of the word fore-spoken, the Sonne of God, who is so carefull not to breake the bruised reed, that hee seeketh to expectorate all feare out of the mindes of all true beleevers by the force of many arguments. The first is drawne à potentiâ Dei, I am the Creatour and Judge of your persecuters; therefore feare them not. The second à praerogativâ Christi, I am the first and the last, and will take notice of every one that hath been unjustly put to death, and make inquisition of bloud, from the bloud of the righteous Abel, to the bloud of the last Martyr that shall bee shed upon the earth, and will require it of them that have spilt it. I am the first: for, in principio erat Verbum; and I am the last, novissimus Adam, manifested in novissimis diebus, to come in novissimâ tubâ, and take account of novissimus quadrans; I am hee that liveth, &c. Here omitting the vaine glosses and collections of some, who turne an history into a mystery, and apply ridiculously S. Johns falling before Christs feet, men∣tioned Ver. 17. to the kissing of the Popes Pantofle; and the description Pri∣mus & novissimus, the first and the last, to a Prelate or Pastour, who ought to be primus ad laborem, novissimus ad requiem, first at his labour, and last at his ease; I take these words with Saint Austine to bee Symbolum abbrevia∣tum, wherein wee are to observe, 1. The death: 2. The resurrection of Christ, 1. Prefaced with a note of attention, Behold. 2. Sealed with a note of certainty, Amen. 3. The fruits and issue of both,
1. In us, 1. Freedome from death. 2. Assurance of life. 2. In him, the power of the keyes, 1. Authoritativè. 2. Possessivè, I have. I am alive, and I was dead. Et quando vixisti, bone Jesu? when didst thou live, sweet Jesu? from the time thou leftest thy Fathers bosome, and satest on thy mothers knee, jam extunc dura pati coepisti, saith Saint Bernard. Many a time have they fought against mee from my youth up may Israel, nay, the God of Israel say. And this some will have to be signified in the phrase, , I was made dead, not strucke downe at one blow; that might have beene a favour: Quid dabis ut uno ictu mortem afferam filio? but hee was put to a tedious and lingring death:  Nay, Saint Gregory saith, Tota vita Christi crux fuit. The Sonne of God humbled himselfe; that is not enough, , hee emptied himselfe, made himselfe of no reputation, and became Homo, & in homine infra hominem: nam flagellari ingenui non est, to bee scourged is no in∣genuous punishment. But it may bee the shame was lessened, because of his Crowne: What Crowne, I pray you? thornes platted upon his tem∣ples? O Regem, O Diadema, O King, O Crowne, saith Bernard: See, O yee daughters of Jerusalem, behold King Solomon with the Crowne wherewith his mother the Synagogue crowned him. But the worst is behinde, hee is condemned to dye: Why, what hath hee done? Is hee a disturber of the peace, who being scarce borne gave peace to all the world, who himselfe is the Prince of peace, and his word the Gospel of peace, and his messengers the Angels of peace, and his man∣date the same with that of Theodosius to Demophilus: Si tu pacem fu∣gis, ego te ab Ecclesiâ meâ fugere mando, If thou flyest peace, I com∣mand thee to get thee packing out of my Kingdome? Did hee bla∣spheme, because hee said, I am the Sonne of God? Si opera Dei facit, quid prohibet Filium Dei appellari? Was hee against the tradition of the Elders? onely against such as annihilated the Law of God, against such upon whom the name of blasphemy is written: such as are those of the Church of Rome. Traditio multis partibus superat Scripturas, saith Costerus: and Salvâ Ecclesiae traditione, non multùm refert etiamsi Scripturae aboleantur. Was hee a malefactour, of whom all the people witnessed, Rectè omnia fecit? All this notwithstanding hee is condem∣ned to dye, and to that death which the Holy Ghost speakes not of with∣out a gradation; Mortem autem crucis: nor the Heathen Oratour with∣out a Quid dicam in crucem tollere? Yet all this is but Joseph his coate torne with the teeth of wilde beasts: Vasculum Anaxarchi, non Anaxarchus. Wee heare of the outward man in agone, not the in∣ward man in agoniâ. I dare not set the paines of the damned, Gods
wrath, and Christs body in a ballance; Crux Christi statera est, saith Saint Bernard. I like in such points rather a Divine of the temper of the Lacedaemonians, In ea quibus fidit vix ingredientem, than an Athe∣nian, Supra vires audacem, liable to Archidamus his checke, , Aut adde viribus, aut adime animo. Is it so (Beloved?) was Christ dead indeed? here seemeth to be mat∣ter for them that are without, to scoffe at Christian Religion: Homi∣nem colitis, hominem Palaestinum & crucifixum adoratis pro Deo: and, Deus vester patibulo affixus est, say the Heathen, Yee worship a God who was put to death and crucified. Wee doe so, , nay, , it was necessary and expedient that hee should so dye: If the wheat corne dye not in the earth, it abideth alone; but if it dye, it bringeth forth much fruit: Gratias ago tritico quòd sic mori voluit & multi∣plicari. Wee say with Tertullian, Quòd Deo indignum est, nobis ex∣pedit: with Saint Jerome, Injuria Domini nostra gloria: and conclude with Saint Ambrose, Quanto major injuria, tanto major ei debetur gratia. Was Christ dead? then was our old man crucified in him, and wee are dead to sinne: how then shall wee live therein? I have put off my clothes, saith the Spouse, how should I put them on? I have washed my feet, how should I defile them? To lay downe our sinnes, or put them off is not sufficient, , they must bee mortified: and this is that death which Saint Leo saith is precious in the sight of God, cùm oc∣ciditur homo non terminatione sensuum, sed fine vitiorum. Behold, I am alive for evermore. Of the divers significations of Ec∣ce two serve for our purpose; Ecce insultationis, and Ecce consolatio∣nis: Ecce insultationis, as behold hee commeth with the clouds, &c. Ecce consolationis, as behold the stone that the builders refused is be∣come the head of the corner. So here for the terrour of Infidels and Persecuters of Christs Church, and for the comfort of the faithfull an Ecce is prefixed: Behold, hee that was dead is alive. Behold the sweet flower of Jesse withered and defaced in his Passion, but re-flourishing a∣gaine in his resurrection, and in him is the blooming and springing of all that love his Name. I am alive. Other doctrine, saith Tertullian, Christ preached per semet∣ipsum; but this of the resurrection in semetipso. Alive for ever. The Scripture speaketh of some that rose mortui, sed morituri. Christ so rose, ut nunquam cadere adjiciat, being risen from the dead hee dyeth no more, death hath no more power over him. Amen is a note of cer∣tainty, like Selah in the Psalmes, which (as a seale) is put by the finger of the Holy Ghost to the words of that God, who is Deus Amen, and whose promises are Yea and Amen. From this Amen and the former Ecce wee are taught, That the Holy Ghost laboureth to secure us and confirme us in the certainty of the do∣ctrine of the resurrection, knowing it to be the faith and patience of the Saints: Fiducia Christianorum resurrectio mortuorum, saith Tertul∣lian. If our hope were in this life onely, wee were of all men most miserable, saith Saint Paul. And the rather doth the Spirit ascertaine
this doctrine, because it hath many enemies, Atheists, Libertines, and sundry sorts of Heretickes besides. The Atheist thinketh there is no re∣surrection, because hee seeth no reason for it: to whom, though it were sufficient to answer with Gregory, Fides non habet meritum, ubi ratio humana praebet experimentum; and with Saint Ambrose, Credimus piscatoribus, non dialecticis: yet to reason a little with these unreasona∣ble men in the words of Saint Paul,Acts 26.8. Why seemeth it incredible unto you, that Christ should raise the dead? Is it not as easie to restore life, as to give it at the first? to raise man out of ashes, as to create him at first out of the dust? Considera autorem, & tolle dubitatio∣nem, saith Saint Austine. The Libertine would have no resurrection, that hee might still enjoy the pleasures of sinne, and sacrifice to his bel∣ly: but for him there is first a Text of counsell,1 Cor. 15.34. Awake to live righte∣ously; and if that will not serve, a Text of judgement,Phil. 3.19. Whose end is damnation, whose god is their belly. Of Heretickes that profes∣sedly oppugned the doctrine of the resurrection, some taught that there is no resurrection at all, as the Saduces; some that the resurrection was already past, as Hymineus and Philetus. Satan is a subtle Ser∣pent, and turneth divers wayes to get in his head. Before Christs death hee worked powerfully in the children of disobedience; in Judas to betray him, in the Pharisees to accuse him, in Pilate to condemne him: but after knowing that the time was come, that the Prince of the world was to bee cast out by the death of Christ, hee was much troubled, and la∣boured by all meanes to hinder Christs Passion: Utinam ne in nemore Pelio, hee wisheth there were no wood in all the world to make a Crosse of: hee workes remorse in Judas, giveth him a halter to hang himselfe: hee employes Pilates wife to send to her husband, to have no∣thing to doe with him. When hee was fast nailed to the Crosse, hee set∣teth the Jewes upon him, to see whether they could perswade him to de∣scend from thence. After this hee spreads abroad a rumour, that Si∣mon Cyreneus was crucified for him, or if hee were crucified, that it was but in appearance onely, and that hee was falsâ pendens in cruce Laureolus: and when his resurrection was so palpable, that it needed no other argument than the amazement of the watch, and Pilates letter to the Emperour, hee suborned a desperate rout to sweare, that his Disci∣ples stole him away by night. After all this hee stirred up certaine Heretickes, who taught, that albeit Christ were indeed risen, yet that wee were not to expect any future resurrection, because the resurrection was past already. But all these shall find, that there is a resurrection for them, to wit, Resurrectio ad condemnationem.John 5.29. Is it so, that Christ our head is risen? then shall wee his members rise also. For hee is primogenitus mortuorum, & primitiae dormien∣tium: the first fruits are carried already into the celestiall barne, and the whole crop shall follow. And this may bee a staffe of comfort to all drouping and fainting soules, ut tali exemplo animati, sub ictu passio∣nis, as Cyprian speaketh, non retrahant pedem, that they draw not backe, but courageously goe on forward to make a good profession, as being se∣cure, Christi milites, non perimi sed coronari, & bonam mortem esse
quae vitam non perimit, sed adimit ad tempus, restituendam in tem∣pore, duraturam sine tempore. This was Jobs comfort, I know my Redeemer liveth: and of other distressed ones, who would not bee deli∣vered that they might bee partakers of a better resurrection. An anci∣ent father giveth these words for a Christians Motto: Fero, taceo, spero; Fero meam crucem, ut ille suam: taceo, quia tu, Domine, fecisti: spero, quia utique fructus erit justo. Is Christ risen from the dead? then wee that are his, are risen with him, at least in the first resurrection: if therefore yee are risen with Christ, seeke the things that are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of his Father. This indeed ought to bee so, but wee finde it otherwise; never more preaching of the resurrection, and never lesse fruit. For all seeke their owne, and none the things that are Jesus Christs. So that Bernards observation fitteth our time: Vides omnem Ecclesiasticum zelum fer∣vere pro solâ dignitate tuendâ, honori totum datur, sanctitati nihil: and againe, all men learned and unlearned presse to Ecclesiasticall cures, Tanquam sine curis quique victuri sint, cùm ad curas pervenerint. The Apostle telleth us, Qui Episcopatum desiderat, bonum opus desi∣derat: non dignitatem, saith Saint Jerome, sed laborem: non delicias, sed solicitudinem: non crescere fastidiis, sed decrescere humilitate: Nay, not onely opus, but onus also in Saint Bernards judgement, though perhaps some Atlas's may thinke they never have load enough. But are the Laity more excusable, who buy and sell the poore for shooes and gay apparrell, and strong drinke? to whom (mee thinkes) I heare the poore cry, Et vos vanitate peritis, & nos spoliis perimitis. How many are there of them, who ingrosse the Lords portion, and bestow hallowed things upon worse than vanity? Wee have a saying against them also out of the same Saint Bernard: De patrimonio crucis Christi non facitis codices in Ecclesiâ, sed pascitis pellices in thalamis; adornatis equos, phale∣rantes pectora, capita deaurantes. Is this our resurrection from sinne? Saint Paul giveth this lesson with a memento, Remember, saith hee, O Timothy, that Christ is raised from the dead. It is a truth as stable as the poles of Heaven, that wee shall have no part of the second resur∣rection to the life of glory, if wee have not a good part in the first to the life of grace. And I have the keyes of Death and of Hell. They are well called keyes of Hell, because there are Inferorum portae mentioned in the six∣teenth chapter of Saint Matthew:Matth. 16.18. . There are many opinions about these keyes; some will have them to bee two, Clavis cognitionis, and Clavis authoritatis: but Allensis and the Schoole∣men denie knowledge to bee a key, except in an improper speech, Quia requiritur ad usum clavis; and they doe well to denie it: for what key of knowledge had that Priest, of whom the Master of the Sentences ma∣keth mention, who baptized in nomine Patria, Filia, & Spiritua sancta? Bonaventure ingenuously confesseth, Quidam in Ecclesiâ habent clavem, quidam claviculam, quidam nullam. Neither doe they stand much upon it; for another of them saith, Dicit Doctor meus, & citat divum
Thomam, quòd quando Apostoli erant ordinati, Sacerdotes erant sine scientiâ. Yet Bernard in his Epistle ad Eugenium maketh knowledge one of the keyes, Claves vestras qui sanùm sapiunt, alteram in discreti∣one, alteram in potestate collocant.  The most received opinion of the re∣formed Churches is, That there is but one key in essence, and that is Ministerium Verbi. The Kingdome of God is compared to a house, the doore of this house is Christ,John 10.7. the key to open and shut this doore is the preaching of the Word: Wee are the savour of death unto death unto some, there is the power of binding; to others of life unto life, there is the power of loosing. Hee that refuseth mee, the word which I have spoken shall judge him, there is the power of binding; againe, The truth shall make you free, there is loosing. But how many soever the keyes bee, Christ hath them, Non solùm authoritativè, sed etiam pos∣sessivè. What meaneth then Bellarmine in his bookes de Romano Pon∣tifice to imply, that the keyes remaine in Christs hands onely at the va∣cancy of the Popedome? What a blasphemy is that of Cusanus, who saith, that potestas ligandi & solvendi non minor est in Ecclesiâ, quàm fuit in Christo? and that of Maldonatus, Christus Petro vices suas tradi∣dit, ipsamque clavem excellentiae, that key of David, which openeth, and no man shutteth? Or if hee have not this key so absolutely as Christ, yet beyond all comparison above other Bishops; they have the keyes of Heaven, sed quodam modo, and with an huc usque licet. Whereupon Petrus de palude observeth, that it was said of them, Quaecunque sol∣veritis in terrâ, erunt soluta in coelo: but of Saint Peter, Brunt solu∣ta in coelis. Pardon, I beseech you, the enlargement of this point; Blasphemiae dies haec est, Rabsakeh hath blasphemed the living God. The Pharisees and Scribes accounted it blasphemy to attribute forgive∣nesse of sinnes to any but God. I am hee that blotteth out thine ini∣quity, saith God by the Prophet Esay: Whereupon Saint Jerome com∣menting, saith, Solus peccata dimittit, qui pro peccatis mortuus est: and Saint Austine accordeth with him, Nemo tollit peccata, nisi so∣lus Deus; tollit autem dimittendo quae facta sunt, adjuvando ne fiant, & perducendo ad locum ubi fieri non possunt. What then doth the Minister upon confession and contrition? Hee pronounceth the penitent absolved; or to attribute the most unto him, hee absolveth the person in facie Ec∣clesiae, remitteth not the sinne absolutely before God. Saint Ambrose shall make up the reckoning: Verbum Dei dimittit peccata: Sacerdos est Judex, Sacerdos officium exhibet, sed nullius potestatis jura ex∣ercet. 1. Hath Christ the keyes of death and hell? O then let us kisse the Sonne, lest hee bee angry, and so wee perish out of the right way. 2. Hath Christ the keyes of hell and death? if then wee belong to Christ, and follow his banner, let us not care what death or hell, man or divell can doe against us: Transvectus vada Tartari, Pacatis redit inferis.
Jam nullus superest timor, Nil ultrà jacet inferos. Jesus of Nazareth is returned from hell, not as Theseus and Hercu∣les, with a Crosse and a Flagge; but with principalities and powers chained before his triumphant chariot: he doth not now threaten death, as before, O mors, ero tua mors; but insulteth over it: O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thankes bee unto God, who hath given us victory, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Cui, &c. THE FOURTH ROW. And in the fourth row a Chrysolite, an Onyx, and a Jasper. A Jasper is a mixt stone, consisting at least of two kinds of gemmes; and therefore may not unfitly decipher our Saviour, consisting of two natures, who by inviting all to come unto him, animi constan∣tiam promovet, comforteth fainting spirits; which (as Rueus saith) is the vertue of the Chrysolite: after his invitation promising to secure and rest all burthened and weary soules, hee proveth himselfe an O∣nyx, wherewith (as Nilus saith) the Nobles of Egypt made suppor∣ters for their beds. If wee admit the Beryll into this fourth ranke, be∣cause it is mentioned with the rest in the Apocalypse, and set here in the first place by Saint Jerome, Junius, Tostatus, and the Kings Tran∣slatours, wee shall lose nothing by the change: for the Beryll (as Abu∣lensis and others affirme) is of singu ertue to cure waterish and run∣ning eyes. True it very well may bee in the stone, but true I am sure i  e doctrine, which this stone (according to his ranke and my her division) standeth for. This promise of our Saviour, I will eas you, is the onely Beryll in the world, which can stay the water of their running eyes, who weep for, and sigh under the heavie bur∣then of sinne. Yee see this fourth order is not out of order, but sorteth well with the doctrine of the fourth Speaker; and doth it not as well sort with the parts of the Preacher? The Chrysolite is a so∣lid stone, not spangled or spotted with golden points, as other gems, but as it were gilt all over; which may well represent the solidity of his proofes, and uniformity of his whole discourse. The Onyx, a transparent gemme, resembleth the perspicuity of his stile; and the Ja∣sper, a stone full of veines, setteth before us the plenty of Scripture sentences, which (like little veines) were diffused through the whole body of his Sermon; and in respect of these we may more truly say of it, than To status of the Jasper, Quot venae, tot virtutes, so many veines, so many vertues.
The embossment of gold, wherein these gemmes of divine doctrine were set, was his Text, taken out of A Sermon preached on Easter Tues∣day by Master Bates fellow of Trinity Col∣ledge, after∣wards Parson of S Clements, and Prebend of Westminster.MATTH. 11.28. Come unto mee all yee that are weary and heavie laden, and I will ease you. MAn at the first was made a goodly creature, in the image of his Maker, having so neere neighbourhood with the eternall Majesty, that hee dwelt in God, and God in him: but by his woefull revolt hee deprived himselfe of that sweet contentment hee still should have enjoyed in God, and by his proud rebellion erected a Babel and partition wall, whereby hee debarred himselfe of the frui∣tion of him, whom to behold is the height of all that good, any crea∣ture can desire. But mans Creatour retaining his love to that which hee had made, though altogether blemished with that which wee had done, looked downe upon us with a compassionate eye of his tender mer∣cie, suffered us not (being desirous of the meanes of salvation) with boot∣lesse travells still to wander in darknesse, as strangers from the life of God: but sent from his bosome his word of truth, light into darknesse, who in the fulnesse of time offered by the light of his countenance to bring us againe to Gods inaccessible brightnesse, and by the vaile of his flesh not only to shelter us from the scorching flames of his Fathers fury (as the pillar of cloud did the Israelites from the heate of the Sun) but also by soliciting our peace, to de∣molish that partition wall which wee had raised against our selves, and to re∣unite us againe inseparably to him, from whom wee had rent and dissevered our selves, crying in the midst of you as you heare, Come unto mee, &c. The voice of God, and not of man, or rather of the eternall wisedome, which was God and man. In these words, which I terme Chsts Proclamation of grace and peace to all soule-sicke sinners, wee may note, 1. An invitation, Come unto mee. 2. The reward of our obedience, I will ease you. In the first part note wee, 1. The party inviting, Christ. 2. The thing he adviseth to, Come. 3. The object to whom, Mee. 4. The parties that are envited singled out by their qualities, all that are weary and heavie laden. In the second part note wee, 1. The party promising, I. 2. The reward it selfe, ease and rest, will ease you.
Here then you see, 1. Love inviting, Come. 2. Truth directing, To mee. 3. Necessity inciting, All that are weary. 4. Reward alluring, And I will ease you. 1. Love inviteth, that we feare not to come. 2. Truth directeth, that we erre not in comming. 3. Necessity inciteth, that we slacke not to come. 4. Reward sustaineth, that wee faint not in com∣ming. Come. Venite, fides exigitur, studium desideratur, saith Saint Am∣brose. Christ his proselytes life must not bee as his confidence in Esay, chapt. 30. in ease and quietnesse:Ver. 15. for then Moab-like he will soone set∣tle on his lees, and have his taste remaining in him, Jerem. 48.11. The Caldean Sagda (as Solinus reporteth) by the spirit inclosed in it, riseth from the bottome of Euphrates, and so closely sticketh to the boards of the ships that passe that river, that without slivering of some part of the barke it cannot be severed; so sinne by the power of the evill spirit arising from the bottomlesse pit of perdition, adhereth so fast to us, that till our brittle Barkes of flesh be slivered off, this Sagda of sinne, can never be removed, but like Dejanira's poysoned shirt, —Qua trahitur, trahit illa cutem. And therefore this sore travell God hath allotted to all the sonnes of Adam, from the first time they become new borne babes in Christ, till they breath out their languishing soules into the hands of their Re∣deemer, to wrestle with their inbred corruptions, and to seeke to shake off the sinne which hangeth on so fast; that howsoever it cannot be al∣together dis-severed before wee are dissolved; yet it may not be a Re∣mora to our ships, much lesse get such strength as to over-rule us. How∣beit, because the flesh is weake, where the spirit is most ready, and the spirit it selfe is not so ready as it should be, because the faculties there∣of through the malignity of sinne are much imbezelled, God spareth not by frequent Scriptures to stirre us up to goe on, and traverse the way of his commandements: some to rowze us up from sleep, as, A∣wake thou that sleepest,Ephes. 5.14. and stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. Some to incite us to goe on forward when wee are rai∣sed,Hebr. 12.14. as, Follow peace and holinesse, without which no man shall see God. Some to encourage us that wee faint not, as, Bee not weary of well doing: for in due time yee shall reape if yee faint not. Once indeed it was said to the Israelites,Galat. 6.9. Stand still, and behold the salva∣tion of God: but now, Come, behold, and stand not still, if you desire the salvation of God. Now no more sit still, as it was once said to the daughter of Babel; but arise and depart: for here is no resting place.
Jacob saw Angels ascending and descending, but none standing or sit∣ting on the ladder. There are many rounds in our Jacobs ladder, where∣by wee climbe to the Mount of God: Non debemus pigri remanere, non debemus superbi cadere, saith Saint Austine. Paul that honoura∣ble vessell of God, though hee laid so fast hold on Christ by faith, and was so knit to him by love, that hee challengeth all powers in heaven and earth to trie if they were able to separate him from the love of his Redeemer (Rom. 8. Ver. 35.) yet reckoning with himselfe as if hee had not comprehended him of whom hee was comprehended, hee for∣gat that which was behinde, and followed hard to the marke, for the price of the high calling of God in Jesus Christ. So true is that of Saint Bernard, Ubi incipis nolle fieri melior, ibi desinis esse bo∣nus. Here then let us tracke out by the footsteps of our spirits motion, how forward wee are in the way of the Lord. If the longing desire of our heart bee unsatisfied, till wee enjoy againe our happy communion with God: if when God saith, Seeke yee my face, thy soule answer, Thy face, Lord, will I seeke: if when Christ soundeth his Venite, thy heart springing for joy resound Davids Ecce, Loe I come; and thy spirit so out-strip the slow motions of thy sluggish flesh, that with the Spouse in the Canticles thou desire to bee drawne after him; then bee thou assured, that this is the finger of God. For no man can come to Christ, but hee whom the Father draweth. But contrariwise, if when the World saith, Come, wee hearken to it, and for Hippomanes golden balls wee refuse to follow Christ: if when the Divell saith, Come, wee listen to his lure, and for his om∣nia tibi dabo, bow to his will: if when the flesh saith, Come, wee trudge to it, and for lascivious lulling in Dalila's lap, wee renounce him who calleth us to bee his Nazarites: these unsanctified affections blab out our inward corruptions, and wee shew our selves to bee the worlds darlings, the Divels pesants, and the fleshes slaves, not Christs sheep. For if it bee true, Omnis qui didicit venit, quisquis non venit, pro∣fectò non didicit, as Saint Austine rightly inferreth. Unto mee. Now followeth the happy terminus ad quem of our spi∣rituall motions: Satius est claudicare in viâ, quàm currere extra vi∣am; halting Jacob will sooner limpe to his journies end, than swift-footed Napthali posting speedily out of the way. Therefore, lest when God calleth us, wee should with Samuel runne to Eli, or linger our comming for feare of mistaking, the Way himselfe chalketh us out the path of salvation, saying, Come to mee. Foure sorts of men seeme to come to Christ, yet come not as they should: The first begin to come, but they fall short in their way; and these are Temporizers, who with Peter stand aloofe, and dare not come neere, lest by continu∣all conversation with him they might perhaps so alter their licentious lives, that in the high Priests Hall their speech might bewray them to bee Galileans. A second sort come, but in their comming wander out of the way, and these are mis-led Papists, who in a sottish modesty dare not presume to touch the hemme of Christ his garments; but must have
Saints to promote their suites. A third sort come, but a cleane con∣trary way, and these are meale-mouthed hypocrites, whose words seeme to bee sweetened with our Saviours breath, they are so savoury: but compare wee the forwardnesse of their lives in practice, to the for∣wardnesse of their tongues in profession, and if yee were as blinde as old Isaac, yee may discerne the voice of Jacob, but the hands of Esau. The fourth sort come, but they over-shoot the way, and these are Hu∣morists, who with Saint Peter in unadvised zeale over-runne them∣selves, and step before Christ; but bee not like unto these: for they want Saint Pauls ita currite for the levell of their way, and Christ his venite for the period of their race. Come unto mee, not to the Law, not to mans traditions, they will rather burthen you than ease you. Am∣bulare vis? ego sum via: falli non vis? ego sum veritas: mori non vis? ego sum vita: Accedit qui credit, Come unto mee in faith, and feare not; in hope, and doubt not; in confidence, and despaire not; in patience, and faint not. Here then yee see, if yee will bee advised by the wonderfull Coun∣seller, that in the way of salvation yee are to seeke to no other guide to lead you than himselfe, in whom all the promises of GOD are Yea and Amen: for under heaven there is no other name given, whereby yee may bee saved, but the name of Jesus Christ. There is one God, one Mediatour betwixt God and man, the man Christ Jesus. Bee it knowne unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through his name is preached unto you forgivenesse of sinnes, and from all things from which by the Law of Moses yee could not bee justified, by him every one that commeth unto him is justified: for so himselfe promiseth, Come unto mee. All. There was a time when the mercies of God were confined within the narrow precincts of Judea; but when the fulnesse of time was come, the Sonne of God and heire of all things brake downe the partition wall, and dispread his saving health among all Nations, teaching and admonishing every man to deny ungodlinesse, and em∣brace the Gospel. For the righteousnesse of God is made manifest by faith to all. There is no difference, but as all sinned in the first Adam, and deprived themselves of the glory of God, so redempti∣on is freely offered to all in the second Adam, that sinners should give all the glory to God: Ideo omnibus opem sanitatis obtulit, ut quicunque perierit mortis suae causam sibi ascribat, qui curari noluit, cùm remedium haberet, quò posset evadere, saith Sain Am∣brose: Say not then in thine heart, I am not the cause of my de∣struction, , injurious blasphemy against so good a God, who so willingly holdeth out his golden Scepter of grace unto us, and so graciously inviteth all that are wearie to rest under the shadow of his mercie. Funeris haud tibi causa fui per sidera juro.
As I live (saith the Lord) I desire not the death of a sinner: thy destructi∣on is from thy selfe, O Israel, but in mee is thy helpe. But if all are invited, why doe not all come? Some like the Israelites, filled with the garlike of Egypt, rellish not heavenly manna: others, like the Laodiceans, thinke they are rich enough, when indeed they are wretched, miserable, and poore. Whence it commeth to passe, that as of many multitudes in Sauls army onely a few bank∣rupt beggars came to David in the cave of Adullam; so none come to Christ but a few sinne-feeling Publicans, troubled Hannaes, weeping Maries, bed-rid Aeneases, leprous Naamans: in a word, none but such as are poore in spirit, and vexed in mind with enduring the heavie burden of sinne. All that are weary and heavie laden. How heavie a burden sinne is, if any mans wounded conscience have not felt, hee may perceive it in the Angels, whom it pressed downe to hell; in Cain, whom it drove to despaire; in David, whom it so bruised, that he cryed out, it is a burden too heavie for me to beare: in our Saviour, from whom it wrung drops of bloud, only for taking our sinne upon him: Why then doe wee take so great paines to doe wickedly? why doe wee mumble Satans morsels, which will one day prove more bitter than the gall of Aspes, and more tormenting than the Vipers tongue? Are wee now speech∣lesse? can wee not now answer these demands? how then shall wee doe, when not onely our consciences shall accuse us, but God also, who is greater than our con∣science, shall condemne us? Issachars legacy was, that hee should bee an Asse couching between two burdens: Surely if hee were, hee might have been like Balaams Asse, to rebuke our forwardnesse; who load our selves with sinne, till with the woman in the Gospel we are so crooked, that we are not able to looke up to the hills from whence commeth our salvation. Saint Paul chose rather with his hands to cast out the tackling of the ship, than that being over-laden it should sinke: and shall not wee unlade our barkes of sinne, for feare that with Hymineus and Philetus wee make shipwracke of a good conscience? Ari∣stippus commanded his servants to cast away his gold in the street, quia tar∣dius irent segnes propter pondus: and shall not wee be content with Eliah, to leave our mantles behinde us, that we may with more expedition be carried to heaven in triumph? Virtutis via non capit magna onera portantes. But why doe wee teach that sinne is a burden, sith so many goe bolt upright under it, and make it a passe-time? Onus non est quod cum voluprate feras, saith the Oratour. I answer, sinne is a burden not to every one at all times, but to a conscience feeling sinnes evill; Multa mala sunt intus, foras nemo tamen ea sentit, nisi qui graditur viam mandatorum Dei, saith Saint Austine; so long as the strong man ruleth the house, he possesseth all things in peace: grave in suo loco non gravitat, they who are dead in sinne feele no weight how great soever it be. Here then let us view our naturall disposition: wee have, as Epiphanius saith, a wild figge-tree rooted in our hearts, which sprouteth out in our words, and sheweth the fruit thereof in our workes; if the fruit thereof seeme sweet unto us, if the grapes of Sodome delight our eyes, if the burden of sinne seeme not onely supportable to us, but also as an ornament to beautifie us; well may we like the Church of Sardis have a name that we live, but we are dead; we are in the gall of bitternesse, and the burden of sinne hath pressed us downe to the bottomlesse pit, which is now ready to shut her mouth upon us. O then let us cr
out of the depth, abyssus abyssum invocet, let the depth of our misery implore the depth of his bottomlesse mercy, and behold the Angel of peace is at hand: for now, and never before, are we fit subjects for this good Samaritan to worke upon; Come unto mee all that are heavie laden. The Spirit of God is upon mee to preach health to those that are broken in heart, liberty to the cap∣tives, and to them that mourne beauty for ashes, and the garment of glad∣nesse for the spirit of heavinesse: whence you see, that none are admitted into Christs Hospitall but lame, sicke, and distressed wretches, for whom hee hath received grace above measure, that where sinne appeared above measure sin∣full, grace might appeare without measure pitifull. Wilt thou then have thy wounds healed? open them. Wilt thou that I raise thee up to heaven? deject thy selfe downe to hell: Ille laudabilior qui humilior, justior qui sibi abje∣ctior. As this may serve to rebuke such Seers as labour not to discover the fil∣thinesse that lyeth in the skirts of Jerusalem, but sow pillowes under mens elbowes, and dawbe up with untempered mortar the breach of sinne in our soules;  so may it lesson all hearers as patiently to abide the sharpe wine of the Law, as the supple oyle of the Gospel; as well the shepheards rod of correction, as his staffe of comfort: in a word, to endure Bezaliel and Aholiab to cut off the rough and ragged knobs, as they desire to be smooth timber in that building, wherein Christ Jesus is the corner-stone: poenitentia istius temporis dolor medicinalis est, poenitentia illius temporis dolor poenalis est; now our sor∣row for our sinnes will prove a repentance not to be repented of, then shall our sorrow be remedilesse, our repentance fruitlesse, our misery endlesse. Wherefore I say with Bernard, Illius Doctoris vocem libenter audio, qui non sibi plau∣sum, sed mihi planctum moveat: I like him that will set the worme of consci∣ence on gnawing, while there is time to choake it; rodat putredinem ut co∣dendo consumat, & ipse pariter consumatur. In the meane time let this bee our comfort, that God will not suffer the sting of conscience too much to tor∣ment us, but with the oyle of his grace will mitigate the rage of the paine, and heale the festred sore which it hath made, with the plaister of his owne bloud. And I will ease you. Thus farre you have traversed the wildernesse of Sin, tired out in that desart, and languishing in that dry land and shadow of death: now behold gaudium in fine, sed sine fine. Happy your departure out of Egypt, and blessed your travell and obedience: you are now to drinke of the comforta∣ble waters that issue out of the spirituall rocke in Horeb, Christ Jesus, and to refresh your wearied limbes and tired soules therewith: I will ease you. I. Man cannot; for man is a sinner, and a sinner cannot be a Saviour: An∣gels cannot; for man in Angels nature cannot bee punished: God cannot; for he is impassible: Saints neither may nor can; for they need a Saviour: but I will. For I am man, and in your nature can dye; I am God, and by any infi∣nite merits can satisfie: and so by my means Gods mercy and justice may stand together, righteousnesse and peace may kisse each other. Thus that faith may looke out of the earth to embrace you, the day-springing from on high hath vi∣sited you. Thrice blessed then must poore hunger-bit and distressed soules bee, who have not a churlish Nabal with power wanting will, nor a King of Sama∣ria with will wanting power; but Elshaddai, a God all-sufficient, to relieve and satisfie them; and for his will, no Assuerus so ready to cheare up a dolefull
Hester, as he a drouping soule: no Joseph so ready to sustaine his father in famine and death, as he is ready with pitty to save a soule from death. No∣li fugere Adam quia nobiscum est Deus. Who shall lay any thing to our charge, sith it is God that doth justifie? Pleasant and sweet were the waters of Meribah to the thirstie Israelites, of Aenochore to Sampsons fainting spi∣rits, gratefull the newes of life to sicke Hezekiah; but our Saviours Epi∣phonema, thy sinnes are forgiven thee, goe in peace, is mel in ore, melos in aure, jubilum in corde. The strings of my tongue cannot be so loosened, that I may expresse the extasie of joy which every sin-burdened soule feeleth, whether in the body or out of the body shee cannot tell, in that by assurance of faith shee can say, My Justifier is with mee, who being Emmanuel, God with us, is also , man with God; one with God in will and power, and wholly for us in power and will. Woe worth then all such as forsaking the fountaine of living water, dig to themselves broken pits of their owne merits, Saints intercession, and the Churches treasurie. Is there no balme in Gilead to cure us? no God in Israel to help us? Si verax Deus qui promittit, mendax uti{que} homo qui diffidit, saith St. Bernard. For I demand, Doe they distrust his power? All power is given him in heaven and in earth, Matth. 28.18. Doe they doubt his will? Be∣hold he saith, Come unto me (before we offer our selves) and I will ease you, not do my best, or endeavour: it is no presumption to beleeve Christ on his word, and rest on it with full assurance. Againe, can none say but Christ, I will ease you? How hopelesse then is their travell, how endlesse their paine, who seeke for hearts-ease in any gar∣den but the Paradise of God, or hope for contentment in any transitorie object the world affordeth? To see Asses feed upon thistles for grapes, were enough to move the spleene of an Agelastus: they have a faire shew like flow∣ers, but pricke in the mouth. Alas, what anguish and horrour must there needs be Cum domus interior gemitu misero{que} tumultu Miscetur. when their consciences, like Sauls evill spirit, haunteth and vexeth them at the heart, when they brave it out in the face? and what is their foolish laugh∣ter among their boone associates, but the cracking of thornes under a pot, sud∣denly extinguished and turned into ashes and mourning? Well may they, like the heathenish Romans of old, have their gods of feare and terrour, but sure they can have none of ease, comfort or quiet. O let not our soule enter in∣to their secrets, but let our peace be still as it is in God, and the repose of our troubled conscience in our Saviours love, who was made a curse for us, that the blessing of Abraham might come upon us: let us enter into the Arke of our confidence, and the Spirit of Christ, like Noahs Dove, shall bring unto us an Olive branch, glad tidings of peace, and true signes of rest to our tempest-tossed consciences: let us draw neare to God, and he will draw neare to us: let us goe to Christ, and he will draw God neare unto us: let us goe unto him in feare and reverence, and he will embrace us; in faith and confience, and he will receive us: though we have beene prodigall and runnagate children, he will receive us into his favour, he will reconcile us to his Father, he will salve our
wounds, hee will quiet our hearts, hee will mitigate our feare of death and destruction, and hee will imparadise us with himselfe in glorie everla∣sting. The spirituall and morall interpretation of the Rehearsers text, with a conclusion of the whole. THus have I now at length presented to your spirituall view the brest-plate of Aaron, decked richly with foure rowes of precious stones, set in bosses of gold. To the foure rowes I have compared the foure methodicall Sermons which yee have heard; the Jewels in the rowes both to the parts of the Speakers, and to their precious doctrine, the embossement of gold to their texts:Orat. pro Cluent. now because as Cepasius in Tullie, post∣quam diu ex intimo artificio dixisset respicite, respicite, tandem respexit ipse: so it hath beene the manner of the Rehearsers, after they had fitly resem∣bled the Preachers, to make some resemblance of themselves and their of∣fice. Sacra haec non aliter constant. I intreat you, right worshipfull, men, fathers, and brethren, not to think that I have so far forgotten modesty, as to ranke my selfe with the meanest of the Jewels in these rowes, nor the texture of my discourse to the embosse∣ments of gold wherein they were set: yet not quite to change the allegory, I finde among the Lapidaries a stone which seemes to me a fit embleme of a Rehearser; it is no precious stone, though it be reckoned with them byPlin. l. 37. c. 9. Pliny and others, because at some times it representeth the colours of the rainebow, non ut in se habeat colores arcus coelestis, sed ut repercussu pa∣rietum illidat: the name of the stone is Iris: whereunto I may make bold to compare my selfe, because in some sort I have represented unto you the beautifull colours of these twelve precious stones, as the Iris doth the co∣lours of the Rainebow; non per inhaerentiam, sed per referentiam: and there∣fore I reflect all the lustre, splendour, and glorie of them, first, upon Al∣mighty God, next upon the Jewels (the Preachers) themselves. Pliny ma∣keth mention of a strangeNat. hist. l. 2. c. 105. Pluvius in Hispania est, qui omnes au∣rei coloris ostendit pisces, nihil extra il∣lam aquam cae∣teris differentes River in Spaine, wherein all the fish while they swim in it have a golden colour, but if you take them out of it, nothing at all differ in colour from other: in like manner, I doubt not but that many things seemed excellent and truely golden in the torrent of the Preachers elo∣quence, which, taken out thence, and exhibited to you in my rehearsall, seeme but ordinary. Howbeit, the whole blame hereof lieth not upon me, but a great part of it upon the very nature of this exercise, to which it isMat. 3.3.essentiall to be defective. The Preachers were voyces like St. John Bap∣tist, the Rehearser is but the Eccho. Who ever expected of an Eccho to re∣peat the whole voyce, or entire speech? sufficient it is that it resound some of the last words, and them imperfectly: it implyeth a contradiction,
that a faire and goodly picture should be drawne at length in a short table:Quintil. in∣stit. orat. l. 10. c. 2. Quicquid alteri simile est, necesse est ut sit minus eo quod imitatur, ut umbra corpore imago facie, & actus histrio∣num veris affe∣ctibus: necesse est ut semper sit posterior qui sequitur. The shadow alwayes comes short of the body, the image of the face, imitation of nature. If I should have given due accents to each of their words and sentences, I should long agoe have lost my spirits; and I may truely say with St. Paul, though in another sense,2 Cor. 2.10. What I have spared herein, for your sake have I spared as well as for mine owne, to ease you of much trouble; and now, after a very short explication and application of mine owne text, I will ease you of all. Joseph. antiq. Jud. l. 3. c. 8.Josephus worketh with his wit a glorious allegorie upon Aarons gar∣ments: The Miter (saith he) represented the Heaven, the two Onyxes the Sunne and Moone, the foure colours in the embroidered Ephod the foure Ele∣ments, the Girdle the Ocean, the Bells and Pomegranates thundering and lightening in the aire, the foure rowes of stones the foure parts of the yeare, the twelve stones the twelve signes in the Zodiacke, or the twelve moneths in the yeare. St.Ep. 128. Quatuor or∣dines quatuor puto esse virtu∣tes, Prudenti∣am Fortitudi∣nem, Justitiam, Temperantiam &c. Jerome taketh the foure rowes for the foure cardinall vertues, which, subdivided into their severall species, make up the full num∣ber of twelve. Although I dare not with Origen runne ryot in allegories, yet I make no question but that we ought to conceive of the Ephod, not as of a vestment onely covering the Priests breast, but as of a holy type or fi∣gure vailing under it many celestiall mysteries; and esteeme the stones set in these rowes upon the Ephod as precious, or rather more in their signification than they are in their nature. In which respect they may be termed, after a sort, so many glorious Sacraments, sith they are visible signes of invisible mysteries, which I am now to declare unto you. St. Paul in the Epistle to the Hebrewes proveth manifestly Aaron to be a type of Christ, his actions of Christs passion; whereunto we may adde his ornaments of Christs offices, Kingly, Priestly, and Propheticall. For he is our Hermes Trismegistus;Mercurius Termaximus. Her∣mes, because he is the Interpreter and Declarer of Gods will; and Trismegi∣stus, that is, thrice greatest, because he is the greatest King, the greatest Priest, and the greatest Prophet that ever came into the world. The Mitre, Diadem-like, compassed, as Josephus writeth, with three circles like a triple Crowne, apparently seemeth to me to prefigure the Kingly office of our Saviour, whereby he sitteth gloriously in the heart of all the Elect, ruling them by the golden Scepter of his word; As evidently the front-plate of pure gold, engraven with holinesse to the Lord, and breast-plate with Urim and Thum∣mim, representeth Christs Priestly function; according to which he beareth the twelve Tribes, representing all his Elect before God for a remembrance, and presenteth their prayers, and them, and himselfe for them, to his Fa∣ther. For, that Thummim, that is, perfections, is an empresse becomming none but our Saviours breast, all Christians will easily grant; and that U∣rim, that is, lights, are an Embleme of the divine nature, Plato professeth, saying, Lumen est umbra Dei, & Deus est lumen luminis, Light is the sha∣dow of God, and God is the light of light it selfe. For, Christ his third of∣fice we need not goe farre to seeke it; for the Bells of Aaron sound out the preaching of the word, and the Pomegranates set before us the fruits there∣of, and both his entire Propheticke function. If there lie any mysterie hid in the numbers, we may conceive the foure rowes of shining stones answe∣rable to the foure Beasts in the Revelation, full of eyes, either prefigured by
foure Evangelists, or the foure orders in the Church Hierarchy, Apostles, Evangelists, Doctors, and Pastors: as for the twelve stones, doubtlesse they had some reference to the twelve Apostles; for in the 21. chapter of theApoc. 21.14. Revelation, where these twelve precious stones are mentioned, it is said expresly, that in the wall there were twelve foundations garnished with all manner of precious stones, and in them the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lambe. You have heard the mysticall interpretation; lend I beseech you an eare to the morall. 1. First, these glorious vestments and ornaments of Aaron set forth un∣to us the dignity of the Priests office:2 Cor. 3.7, 8. and if the ministration of the letter were glorious, shall not the ministration of the Spirit be much more? Yes, how dark and vile soever our calling seemeth to the eyes of the world, it shall one day appeare most glorious, when they that turne many untoDan. 12.3. righteousnesse shall shine as starres in the firmament for evermore. Here I cannot conceale from you, thatIn Exo. c. 28. Cappo one of the Popes Botchers taketh measure of Aarons garments, to make massing vestments by: as be∣fore him Durand hath done in his booke intituled rationale divinorum, where he saith, Noster Pontifex habet pro feminalibus sandalia, pro lineâ al∣bam, pro balieo cingulum, pro podere tunicam, pro Ephod stolam, pro rationa∣li pallium, pro cidari mitram, pro lamina crucem: just; but where is the causible? in Latine casula, sic dicta, quasi parva casa, saith hee, because it closeth the Priest round as it were with a wall, having a hole for him to put out his head, like a Lover, to let out smoake, signifying, that the Priest ought to be like a little cottage with a chimney in it, heated with the fire of zeale, sending up hot fumes of devotion, and letting them out with his breath at the LOVER of his mouth. But I will not put them to so hard a taske, as to pa∣rallel each of their vestments with Aarons: all that I shall say to them for the present is this, That the neerer they prove their vestments to come to Aarons ornaments, the more ceremoniall and typicall they prove them; and consequently, more unfit to be retained now by Christians, if the Apostles argument drawne from theHeb. 10.1. vanishing of the shadow at the presence of the body be of any force: therefore let the observation of Cappo passe with a note of plumbea falsitas, not aurea veritas, wherewith he graceth it. 2. My second observation is, that God both first beginneth with the breast, and appointeth also the most glorious and precious ornaments for it:Exod. 28.4. The garments shall be these; thou shalt make a breast-plate, an Ephod, &c. after followeth the mitre, to the making whereof blew silke onely and fine twi∣ned linnen is required, with a plate of gold on it; but for the breast-plate, cloth of gold wrought about with divers colours, plates of gold, and foure rankes of the richest jewells in all the treasury of nature are appointed: all this, as we may piously conceive, to signifie, that God best esteemeth the breast and heart, and not the head: MyPro. 23.26. sonne, give mee thy heart. Our heavenly Father preferreth enflamed affections above enlightened thoughts: he can∣not bee received or entertained in our narrow understanding, yet will heeEph. 3.17. dwell in our hearts by faith, if we enlarge them by love. Cecidit Lucifer, Se∣raphim stant aeternâ incommutabilitate, & incommutabili aeternitate, the An∣gels which had their names from light fell like lightening from heaven; but
the ministring spirits, which are by interpretation burning fire, hold yet their place and ranke in the Court of God. Let ambitious spirits seeke to shine in Aarons mitre, or at least to be caracter'd in the Onyx stones on his shoulders: my hearts desire was, and ever shall be to be engraven in one of the jewells upon the breast-plate, to hang with the beloved Disciple upon the bosome of my Saviour. 3. Thirdly, I observe yet again, that the names of the twelve tribes, which were before written in the Onyx stones upon the shoulders of Aaron, are here engraven againe in the rowes of jewels hanging neere his heart: which, as it representeth Christ his both supporting and affecting his chosen; sup∣porting them on his shoulders, & affecting them in his heart: so it teacheth all the Ministers of the Gospel to beare the names of Gods people committed to their charge, not onely upon their shoulders, by supporting their infirmity; but also upon their hearts, Ver. 29. by entirely affecting them above o∣thers; and above all things Gods glory in the salvation of their soules. IfJohn 21.15.thou love me, saith Christ, feed my sheep; if you desire that Christ should beare you on his heart before his Father, beare you the names of his Tribes (his chosen) on your hearts before him. 4. Fourthly, you may easily discerne, that the stones, as they are of sun∣dry kindes, and of different value, so they are set in divers rowes, 1. 2. 3. 4. which illustrateth unto us the divers measures of grace given to beleevers in this life, and their different degrees of glory in the life to come. All the stones that were placed on Aarons breast-plate were Urim and Thummim, that is, resplendent and perfect jewells; yet all were not equall: some were richer and above others in value, as those in the second row; even so all the elect are deare to our Saviour, yet some are dearer than others: he entirely affected all the Apostles, yet Saint John, whoJohn 21.20. leaned upon his breast, was neerer to him than any of the other: all the Jewels were set in gold in their embossements, yet one was set above another; in like maner all the faithfull shall shine as starres in the firmament, yet some shall be set in a higher sphere than others: for as the Apostle teacheth us, there is1 Cor. 15.41. one glory of the Sunne, and another of the Moone, and another of the Starres; for one Starre differeth from another in glory, and so shall be the resurrection of the dead. 5. Fifthly, looke yee yet neerer upon these shining stones, and yee shall finde, that they will not onely delight and lighten the eyes of your under∣standing; but also heate and enflame your devout affections. They are as twelve precious bookes, wherein you may reade many excellent lessons printed with indeleble characters. You see cleerly here the names of each of the Tribes in severall engraven; let your marginall note be, God hath from all eternity decreed a certaine number of Elect to bee saved, and hee hath written their names in severall in the booke of life. 6. Sixthly, observe that the names of the Tribes are not written in pa∣per, nor carved in wood, but engraven in solid and precious stones with the point of a Diamond, never to be razed out: let your interlineary glosse be, None of those whose names are written in the book of life can be stricken out. For there is no blotting, interlining, nor variae lectiones in that booke; stars there are, but no obeliskes: the Elect therefore though they may fall grie∣vously and dangerously, yet not totally nor finally.
Stella cadens non est stella, cometa fuit. Were you, beloved, but embossed or enammeled in the ring upon our Savi∣ours finger, you were safe enough; for no man can plucke any thing out of our Saviours hand: but now that you are engraven as signets on our Savi∣ours heart, what can be your feare? what may be your joy? Is it so? doth our high Priest set us on his heart? and shall not wee set our heart on him? shall we esteem any thing too deare for him, who estee∣meth us so deare unto him? Hee who once upon the Crosse shed his heart bloud for us, still beareth us upon his heart, and esteemeth of us as Cornelia did of her Gracchi, and presenteth us as it were in her words to his Father, Haec sunt ornamenta mea, these be my jewels. Doth he make such reckoning of us? and is it our desire he should doe so? then for the love of our Redeemer let us not so dishonour him, as to fill the rowes of his breast-plate with glasse in stead of jewels; let us not make him present to his Father either counterfeit stones through our hypocrisie, or dusky through earthlinesse and worldly corruption; let us rub, scowre, and brighten the good graces of God in us, that they may shine in us, & we may be such as our Saviour esteemeth us to be, that is, orient and glorious jewels. The summe of all is this: Yee have heard of foure rowes of precious stones set in bosses of gold upon Aarons breast-plate; and by the foure rowes you understand the foure well ordered & methodicall Sermons by me rehearsed: by the jewels, either the eminent parts of the Preachers, or their precious doctrines: by the embossments of gold, in which these precious gems of di∣vine doctrine were set, their texts: nothing remaineth but that the breast-plate being made, you put it on; and as Aaron did, beare it on your hearts. By wearing & bearing it there, you shall receive vertue from it, and in some sort participate of the nature of these jewels; in modesty of the Ruby, in chasti∣ty of the Emrald, in purity of the Onyx, in temperance of the Amethyst, in ardent love of the Carbuncle, in invincible constancy of the Adamant, in sa∣crificing your dearest hearts bloud and affections to Christ, & in passion for him (if you be called thereunto) of the Hematite. You shall gloriously beau∣tifie the brest-plate of our Aaron, who hath put on his glorious apparrell, and sacred robes, and is entred into the Sanctum Sanctorum in heaven, and at this time beareth our names on his breast for a remembrance before God his fa∣ther; and long it shall not be ere he come from thence, and all eyes shallApoc. 1.7. see him, and all kindreds of the earth shall mourne before him: then shall he say to us, Lift up your heads, looke upon my breast, reade every one your name engraven in a rich jewell. You were faithfull unto death: therefore see here now I give you a crowne of life; behold in it for every Christian vertue a jewel, for every penitent teare Chrystall & Pearle, for every green & blew wound or stripe endured for me an Emrald and a Saphir, for every drop of bloud shed for the Gospel a Ruby and an Hematite: weare this for my sake, and reigne with mee for evermore, Cui, &c.
THE DEVOUT SOULES MOTTO, A Sermon preached in Saint Peters Church in Lent; Anno 1613. THE XXXVI. SERMON. PSAL. 73.25. Whom have I in heaven but thee, O Lord? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee. Right Worshipfull, &c. THe words which ourLuke 12.49. Saviour spake concerning the is∣sue and successe of his preaching, may serve fitly for a preface to my intended discourse upon this Text: Ignem veni missurus inter vos▪ & quid volo nisi ut accendatur? I come to put fire among you, or rather in you: and what is my desire, but that by the blasts and motions of Gods Spirit, and the breath of my mouth it may presently bee kindled, and burne in your hearts? Burne it will not without fuell; take heed therefore, saithIn opusc. Ca∣ve ne injicias quod fumum aut foetorem ministret. Bonaventure, what you cast into this fire to feed the flame: for if it be grosse, impure, and earthy matter, the flame will be ob∣scure, and the fume unsavoury; but if it be refined, pure, and celestiall, the flame will be cleare, and the fume a sweet perfume in the nostrils of Almigh∣ty God. Nadab andLevit. 10.1. Abihu smoaked themselves for offering strange fire upon Gods Altar: but wee are like to burne in unquenchable fire, if wee of∣fer not continually the fire I am now to treat of, upon the Altar of our hearts: and yet it is a strange fire too; for it giveth light, yet burneth not; or rather it burnes, yet consumeth not; or rather it consumes, yet impaires not, but dilateth and enlargeth the heart. Other fire burnes blacke, and marreth the beauty of the body; but this contrariwise giveth beauty to the soule.
for as SaintMor. in Job l. 18. Non cla∣rescit anima fulgore aeter∣nae pulchritu∣dinis, nisi hic arserit in offici∣nâ charitatis. Gregory rightly observeth, the soule shineth not with the bright∣nesse of everlasting beauty, that burneth not in the forge of charity. With this beauty God is so enamoured, that SaintDe dilig. Deo. Major est in amore Dei, qui plures traxerit ad a∣morem Dei. Bernards observation is true, that he is greatest in favour, and in the love of God, who draweth most to the love of God. If we desire to know, saith SaintAug. Enchi∣rid. ad Lau∣rent. c. 117. Austine, what a man is, wee enquire not what he beleeveth, or what he hopeth for, but what he loveth. A man may beleeve the truth, and be a false man: he may hope for good things, and yet be exceeding bad himselfe; but he cannot love the best things, but he must needs be good: he cannot affect grace, if hee have not received some mea∣sure thereof; he cannot highly esteeme of God, and not be high in Gods esteeme. As the love of the world maketh a man worldly, and the love of the flesh fleshly; so the love of the Spirit makes the children of God spiri∣tuall, and the love of God partaker of the divine2 Pet. 1.4. nature: for God is love. Now, saith Saint Paul, that is, in this life, abideth1 Cor. 13.13. faith, hope, and charity; but after this life, of these three charity onely remaineth. For when we have received the end of our faith, which is the salvation of our soules, and taken possession of the inheritance which we have so long expected by hope, faith shall be swallowed up in vision, and hope in fruition; but then love shall be in greatest perfection. Our trust is, that we shall not alwayes walk by faith, and our hope is, that we shall one day hope no more; we beleeve the end of faith, and hope for the end of hope; but love no end of our love: but con∣trariwise desire, that it may bee like the soveraigne object thereof, that is, eternall and infinite. To leap over this large field at once, and comprise all in one sentence concerning this vertue, of which never enough can be said: Love brought God from heaven to earth; love bringeth men from earth to heaven. In which regard it may not be unfitly compared to the ladder, at the foot whereofGen. 28.12. Jacob slept sweetly, and in his dreame saw Angels climbing up by it to heaven. For upon it the religious soule of a devout Christian resteth and reposeth her selfe; and by it in her thoughts and de∣sires she ascendeth up to heaven, as it were by foure steps or rounds, which are the foure degrees of divine love. 1. To love God for our selves. 2. To love God for himselfe. 3. To love God above all things. 4. To love nothing but God, or in a reference to him. First, to love God for our selves or our owne respect, whereunto wee are induced by the consideration of his benefits and blessings bestowed up∣on us, and continued unto us. The second is to love God for himselfe, whereunto wee are moved by the contemplation of the divine essence, and his most amiable nature. The third is to love God above all things, whereunto we are enclined by observation of the difference between God and all things else. The fourth is to love nothing but God, that is, to settle our affections, and repose our desires, and place our felicity wholly and solely in him. To which highest round or step of divine love and top of Christian perfection we aspire, by fixing our thoughts upon the all-sufficiency of God, who
hath in him infinite delights and contentments to satisfie all the appetites of the soule; whereof the Kingly Prophet David was fully perswaded, when lifting up his heart to God, and his eyes to heaven, he calleth God himselfe to witnesse, that he desired no other happinesse than what he enjoyed in him, saying, Whom have I in heaven but thee? These words may admit f a double construction: 1 Either that David maketh God his sole refuge and trust: 2 Or that he maketh him his chiefe joy and whole hearts delight. For the first sense, viz. Whom have I in heaven but thee for my refuge, and strength of my confidence? we are to know that in heaven and in earth there are other besides God; in heaven the elect Angels, and the spirits ofHeb. 12.23. just men made perfect; in earth there are men and the creatures: yet a re∣ligious soule reposeth no confidence in any of these. First, not in the crea∣ture in generall, for it isRom. 8.20. subject to vanity: not in riches, for1 Tim. 6.17. they are un∣certaine; Charge the rich in this world that they trust not in uncertaine riches: not inJer. 9.23. wisedome, or strength, or power; nor in the favour ofPsal. 146.3. Princes, nor any childe of man, for there is no helpe in them. I will yet ascend higher, even to heaven, and to the Angels and soules there. For whatsoever pow∣er, or strength, or helpe may be in them, we may not put our trust in them. 1 Not in the soules of Saints departed; for theyEsay 63.16. take no notice of our af∣faires here, neither have we any order to addresse our selves to them: A∣braham is ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledgeth us not:2 Kin. 22.20. Good Josiah seeth not the evill which befell his subjects after his death. 2 Not in An∣gels; for though they excell in strength, and are ministringHeb. 1.14. Spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heires of salvation, yet we have no charge to worship them, or relie upon them for our salvation. Nay, wee are charged to the contrary, both from God and from themselves; from God,Mat. 4.10. Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serve: and,Col. 2.18. Let no man beguile you in voluntary humility, and worshipping of An∣gels: and from themselves also,Apoc. 19.10. & 22.9. And I fell downe at the feet of the An∣gel that shewed me these things, and he said unto me, See thou doe it not, I am thy fellow servant, worship God. For the second sense, viz. Whom have I in heaven but thee for my chiefe joy and sole hearts delight? we are to know that the faithfull soule is wedded to God, and like a loyall Spouse casteth no part of her conjugall affection upon any but him. Love she may whom he loveth, and what he comman∣deth her to love, for him, and in him, but not as him: if she doth so, shee becommeth Adultera Christo, as St. Cyprian speaketh, and may not be ad∣mitted to sing in Davids quire, or at least not to bear a part in this Antheme, Whom have I in heaven but thee, O Lord? No more than the life of the body can bee maintained without natu∣rall heat and moisture, can the life of grace be preserved in the soule with∣out continuall supply of the moisture of penitent teares, and a great mea∣sure of the heat of divine love, wherewith we are to consume those spiri∣tuall sacrifices of prayer and praises, which we are now and at all times
to offer, lifting up pure hands and hearts unto God. To kindle this sacred fire, I have brought you a live coale from the Altar of incense, Davids heart, sending up sweetest perfumes of most fragrant and savourie medi∣tations. This coale the best Interpreters ancient and later, conspiring in their ex∣positions blow after this manner: St.Hier. in hunc locum. Ne{que} in coelo ne{que} in terrâ alium praeter te quae∣sivi. Jerome thus, I have sought none in heaven or earth beside thee.Calvin. Prae∣ter Deum nihil in coelo vel in terrâ appeto. Calvin, I desire nothing in heaven or earth but thee.Cajetan. Te solum in coelo & in terrâ volui. Cajetan, Thee alone I affect in heaven and in earth.Marlor. Ni∣hil tecum amo. Marlorat, I love nothing with thee. And most effectuallyMollerus. Te pro & prae om∣nibus thesauris aestimo. Mollerus, I esteeme thee in stead of and above all treasures: as if he should say in more words; Others lay up treasures upon earth, but heaven is my treasurie, and God is my riches; he is my lot, as I am his purchase; he is the onely supporter of my crowne, and crown of my joy, & joy of my heart: upon him I set my whole delight, in him I repose all my confidence, to him I addresse all my petitions, from him I expect all my happinesse: all my hope is in his promises, all my com∣fort in his word, all my wealth in his bounty, all my joy in the light of his countenance, all my contentment in his love: above him, without him, be∣sides him I love nothing; but all things in him and for him. Lord let me live out of the world with thee, but let me not live in the world without thee. For I make no reckoning of any thing in the world in comparison of thee, nor of all the world without thee: take away all things from me so thou givest me thy selfe; for if thou takest away thy selfe, thou takest away all things. O let me therefore quickly enjoy thee in heaven, for even whilest I am upon earth my heaven is in thee. Here I cannot hold on my Paraphrase, but must needs breake off with that passionate exclamation of St.Poelicissimam animam quae Deo sic à Deo meretur affici, ut per unitatem spiritus in Deo nihil amet nisi Deum. Bernard, O thrice happy soule which by God and his grace art so affected with God and his love, that in God, in whom all things are to be had, thou desi∣rest nothing but God himselfe. By this bright blaze of the words you may easily discerne the parts; which are two, 1 A higher straine of notes ascending, Quis mihi, &c. 2 A lower of notes descending, & tecum non optavi, &c. Or if you like better to change the terms of musick, which is the rhetorick of sounds, into the termes of rhetoricke, which is the musicke of words; this sentence consisteth of 1 A passionate interrogation, Whom have I in, &c. 2 A confident asseveration, And I desire none, &c. In both I observe, 1 The convenience of the order, Whom have I in heaven, and then, I desire, &c. 2 The proprietie of the phrases have and desire; have in heaven, desire on earth: nothing to be desired, but to be had in heaven; nothing to be had, but to be desired on earth. 3 The varietie of the Prepositions praeter and cum, I have nothing but
thee: I desire nothing with thee, for the reason assigned byPaulin. in Bib. Patr. to. 5. p. 1. Omnium conditor, cui nihil eorum quae fecit valet aequari, non dignatur cum his quae condi∣dit aequari. Paulinus; God, who made none of his creatures in any degree equall to himselfe, will have none made of like unto himselfe. Whereupon it ensueth, that there is fulnesse of delight and contentment in God, and that there is no solid delight and contentment for the immor∣tall soule of man but in him; and consequently, that we are to set our heart, and settle our love, and ground our repose, and repose our felicity wholly and solely in him, withAug. confes. l. 10. Cum quo solo, & de quo solo, & in quo solo anima in∣tellectualis ve∣rè beata est. whom onely, and in whom onely, and through whom onely the understanding soule of man findeth and everlastingly enjoyeth true blessednesse. Of which use of the doctrine, and doctrine of the notes, and notes of my Text, whilest I treat briefly, I humbly entreat Almighty God to assist mee with his Spirit, and you to support mee with your patience. First, of the order. As God first created the heaven, and all the host thereof, and after the earth and earthly creatures; so in our desires we ought first to aime at heaven and heavenly objects, and after wee have fixed our thoughts, and settled our affections upon them, to have an eye to the earth, and take order for the things of this life. God hath placed the heaven above the earth, and shall we by our inordinate desires set the earth above the hea∣ven, advancing things temporall above those that are eternall? this were to overthrow the order of nature, and breake the golden rule laid down by our Saviour,Mat. 6.33. Seeke yee first the Kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse, and all these things shall be ministred unto you. First, lift up your eyes and your hearts to heaven, and say with David, Whom have I in heaven but thee? and then tell us what or whom you desire, or desire not upon earth. Have I in heaven, or desire on earth. The Translaters might have retai∣ned the verbe have in both members: but in regard of the deceivablenesse and uncertainty of earthly goods and possessions, they change the verbe have in the first member into desire in the second, have in heaven and desire on earth, not desire in heaven and have on earth: for in precise truth there is nothing which a religious soule can desire, but shee hath it in hea∣ven: and on the contrary, nothing to be had that is firmely possessed and enjoyed, which she desireth on earth; Heaven is the place of having, the earth of desiring or craving. When an old man being asked of his age, an∣swered in the Latine phrase, Octoginta annos habeo, that is, I have or reckon upon fourscore yeeres: a Philosopher standing by tooke him up, saying, Imò tot annos non habes, what saist thou, I have or reckon upon fourescore yeeres? just so many yeeres thou hast not; for in numbring the dayes and yeeres of our life, whose parts are never all come till they are all gone, we usually count upon those yeeres onely that are fully past, which we there∣fore have not, because they are past and gone; even as he that taketh a lease for terme of yeeres, after he hath worne them out, hath no more terme in his lease, or estate in his living; no more may any man be said to have those yeeres good, which hee hath spent in the lease of his life. Much lesse may he be said to have those that are to come, because they are not yet, and hee is altogether uncertaine whether they are to come or no. For all that hee knoweth, this day the lease of his life may expire, this houre his last glasse may be running, at this very moment and point of time the threed of his
life may be cut off. Now if wee cannot be said truely to have any part of our time, how can we have any part in things temporall? if the lease of our lives, by which we hold all our earthly goods and possessions, be of so uncertaine a date, let our common Lawyers talke never so much of possessi∣ons and estates, and firme conveighances and perpetuities, and severall kindes of tenures, they shall never perswade mee, that there is any sure hold or good tenure of any thing save God and his promises: it is impossible that wee should have any estate in things that are altogetherCyp epist. l. 2. Nec fiduciam praebent possi∣dentibus stabi∣lem, quae pos∣sessionis non habent verita∣tem. unstable. Hereof it seemeth Abraham was well advised; for though he were an exceeding rich man, yet we reade of no purchase made by him, save onely of aGen. 25.10. cave in Machpelah, for him and his heires to hold, or rather to hold him and his heires for ever. If any man ever knew the just value of all earthly commo∣dities, it was King Solomon, the mirrour of wisedome, and yet he, after he had weighed them all in the scales of the Sanctuary, found them as light as vanity it selfe. Omnia sub sole vanitas; ergo supra solem veritas, as right∣ly inferrethPaulin. in opusc. Paulinus: If all things under the sunne are vanity; therefore the verity of all things is above the sunne, viz. In heaven. Whom have I in heaven but thee? that is, thee I have, and none but thee in heaven. I deny not that which SaintTract. 50. in Johan. Habes Christum in praesenti per signum, in prae∣senti per fidem, in praesenti per baptismatis sacramentum. Austine affirmeth in ex∣presse termes, that we have God many waies with us in this life; for we see him in his workes, we heare him in his word, we taste him in the Sacrament, we feele him by the motions of the Spirit within us, we touch him by faith, we embrace him by love, we relye upon him by hope, we have private conference with him by prayer: yet all this is nothing to our modus habendi, our manner of ha∣ving him in heaven. Then a man may be truely said to have a lordship, man∣nour, benefice, or living, when he entereth upon the fruits thereof, and re∣ceiveth the crop. The Lord is indeed our lot and portion even in this life; but we cannot reap the thousanth part of the profits and delights he hath in himselfe, and will afford us hereafter. They to whom hee most imparteth himselfe, and communicateth his goodnesse here, have but a taste onely of the tree of life, a weak sent of the flowers of Paradise, a confused noise of hea∣venly musicke as it were afarre off, no more than a glympse of the sunne of righteousnesse, but a blast of the Spirit onely, an earnest-penny of their wages; yet such a taste as more satisfieth them than a royall banquet furnished with all the delicacies the sea or land can yeeld: such a sent as they will not leave for all the sweet odours of Arabia: such a noise as they would not misse the hearing thereof, for all the consorts in the world: such a glympse, as is to be preferred before the full view of all the Kingdomes of the earth, and the glory of them: such a blast, as more refresheth the soule, than a constant gale of prosperous fortune: such an earnest-penny, as they would not lose for the treasures of Solomon. This taste, this sent, this glympse, this blast, this earnest-penny, the Kingly Prophet David so exceedingly desired, that he compareth the ardency of his affection to the thirst of a Hart, either long chased, or after he is stung with the serpent Dipsas, that sets all his throat on fire. As thePsal. 42.1, 2. Hart brayeth and panteth in this case for the rivers of waters to coole his heate, and quench his thirst, so panteth my soule after thee, O God. My soule thirsteth for God, for the living God; when shall I come and ap∣peare before God? Of this thirst of the soule they onely can speake feelingly,
who have been longCant 2.5 Stay mee with sla∣gons, and com∣fort mee with apples: for I am sicke with love. sicke with the Spouse in the Canticles, who feeling her heart faint, and all her vitall faculties faile, cryeth out, Stay mee, &c. that is, hold life in mee with cordiall waters and soveraigne smells; for I lan∣guish, I swoune, my soule is running out of the doores of my lips after him, whom she incomparably loveth above all things in heaven and in earth; yet she seeth here nothing but his backe parts, that is, obscure shadowes and resemblances of him. And if she be so enamoured with these, how will she be ravished at the sight of his countenance? if she take such contentment in the contemplation of his image in a mirrour, how will shee be transported, when she shall see him face to face, and bee united to him spirit to spirit? if she take such pleasure in pledging him in the bitter cup of his passion, what will she take inPsal. 16.11. drinking of the rivers of pleasures, that run at his right hand for evermore? To borrow a straine of the Schooles, for the closing up of this sweet note, Hic Deum amamus amore desiderii, at in coelo amore amici∣tiae, Here we love God with a love of desire, there with a love of friendship; here we desire to have God, there we have our full desire: and so I fall into the maine doctrine of the Text, That there is fulnesse of delight and content in God. Quid eo avarius est, cui Deus non sufficit, in quo sunt omnia? Can we desire larger possessions than immensity? a surer estate than immutabi∣lity? a longer terme of yeeres than eternity? Let SaintDe vitâ contemplat. l. 2. c. 15. Quid po∣test eo esse foe∣licius, cujus ef∣ficitur suus conditor cen∣sus, & haeredi∣tas ejus digna∣tur esse ipsa di∣vinitas? si mo∣do sanctis ope∣ribus eum co∣lat, omnes fru∣ctus ex illo percipiet. Prosper speake, Who so fortunate, as he whose Maker is his fortune? who so rich, as hee who possesseth him that possesseth all things, whose lord is his lot, and his owner part of his goods? Howbeit, because we cannot perfectly survey, much lesse take full possession of this our large or rather infinite inheritance, in this life, Mol∣lerus conceiveth these words not to be uttered in an exultation of spirit, ra∣vished with the contemplation of God; but rather as a prayer to this ef∣fect: O that I had thee in heaven; as when the Prophet demandeth, Who will shew us any good? wee take the meaning to be, O that any would shew us some good: & in like maner, in the second of Samuel, Who2 Sam. 23.15. will bring mee water out of the fountaine? that is, O that some would give mee a draught of it. Notwithstanding I see no reason why wee should vary from the most generall interpretation of these words, which is, that they containe a prote∣station, not a prayer, and carry this sense: O Lord, I am so ravished with thy beauty, and satisfied with thy love, that I desire nothing like unto thee, nay, no∣thing but for thee, nay, nothing but thee. With which exposition that straine of Paulinus perfectly accordeth, though set in a more dolefull key, when the barbarous and savage Goths had invaded the City of Nola, ransacked his house, rifled his coffers, and tooke away all that he had; he yeelded not to the streame of sorrow, which might have carried him into the gulph of despaire, but striving against it, hee lifteth up his hands and head above wa∣ter, praying to God after this manner:Aug. de civ. Dei l. 1. c. 10. Domine, ne excrucier prop∣ter aurum & argentum; ubi enim sunt om∣nia mea tu seis: ibi enim habe∣bat omnia sua, ubi eum the∣saurare ille monuerat, qui haec mala ven∣tura praedixe∣rat. Lord, let not the losse of these things vexe mee, or disquiet my soule: for thou knowest where I have laid up all my treasures, to wit, in thee: for, whom have I in heaven But thee? These words are not expressed in the originall, yet by compa∣ring this with the latter clause, And in earth I desire nothing with thee, are necessarily added to supply the sense. Yea, but you wil say, how might David truly demand, Whom have I in hea∣ven but thee? Is there none to be had in heaven but God? are there none that
walk in the streets of the celestiall Jerusalem paved with gold? do none dwell in those glorious tabernacles that are not made with hands? do those twelve precious gates serve onely to beautifie the holy City? doe none enter in at them? surely, if these dark & low rooms are so well filled, it is not like those large, faire, & lightsome upper roomes are void? the sky is not more richly decked with glistering starres, than the throne of God with celestiall lights: out of question there are innumerable regiments, bands, & royall armies of Cherubins & Seraphins, Archangels & Angels, Saints & Martyrs; yet the faithfull soule hath none of these, or rather none of these hath her, but hee whom they all serve, who hath vouchsafed to make her his Spouse, & marry her to himself in righteousnes: in none but him she hath affiance, to none but him she addresseth her prayers, for none but him she keepeth her heart; him she serveth as her lord, obeyeth as her king, honoureth as her father, & loveth as her husband; and in this respect may truly say, Whom have I in heaven but thee? WhenXenophon. Cyr. poed. l. 3. Cyrus took the king of Armenia & his son Tigra∣nes, & their wives & children prisoners, & upon their humble submission, beyond all hope, gave them their liberty & their lives; in their return home, as they all fell on commending Cyrus, some for his personage, some for his puissance, some for his clemency; Tigranes asked his wife, What thinkest thou of Cyrus? is he not a comely & a proper man, of a majesticall presence? Truly, saith she, I know not what maner of man he is, I never looked on him. Why (quoth hee) where were thine eyes all the while? upon whom didst thou then look? I fixed mine eyes (saith she) all the while upon him (mean∣ing her husband) who in my hearing offered to Cyrus to lay downe his life for my ransome: In like maner, if any question the devout soule, whether she be not enamoured with the beauty of Cherubins & Seraphins, Angels or Saints: her answer will be the same with that of Tigranes his wife, that she never cast a look on them, because her eyes were never off him, who not only offered to lay, but laid down his life for her, & ransomed her with his own bloud. Whom should she have in heaven but him, who hath none on earth but her? Intus apparens prohibetMercenarius in phys. extraneum, the vessell that is full of balsamum excludeth all other oyles or liquors: the soule that is full of God, and full with God, excludeth the love of all creatures, and accounteth them as nothing in comparison, as we may see in S. Paul,Phil. 3.7, 8. What things were gaine to mee, those I account losse for Christ, yea, doubtlesse I account all things but losse for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ. And in holy Igna∣tius theHieron. catal. viror. illust. Ig∣nis, crux, be∣stiae, confra∣ctio ostium, membrorum divisio, & toti∣us corporis contritio, & tota tormenta Diaboli in me veniant, tan∣tum ut Chri∣sto fruar. ancient Bishop of Antioch, who when he was ready to be stript and thrown naked to the Lions, brake out into this passionate speech, Take away all from mee, and come what can come upon mee, fire, crosse, beasts tearing my flesh, parting of my members, breaking of my bones, and contrition of my whole body, and all the torments that man or divell can devise, onely that I may enjoy Christ. That which Origen delivereth concerning the nature of Manna, that it answered to every mans severall taste, we have good warrant of Scrip∣ture to affirme of God, who satisfieth with infinite delicacies all their appe∣tites who long for him. Doe they thirst for grace? he is so full of grace, that of hisJohn 1.16. fulness we all receive. For glory? he is thePsal. 24.10. King of glory. For wise∣dome? in him are all the treasures of wisedome &Colos. 2.3. knowledge hid. For peace? he is theEsay 9.6. Prince of peace. For beauty? he isPsal. 36.9. fairer than the sons of men;
grace is powred into his lips. For life? with him is thePsal. 45.2. Well of life, and in his light shall we see light. For joy and pleasures? in his presencePsal. 16.11. is fulnesse of joy, and at his right hand there are pleasures for evermore, wherewith hee quencheth all the thirsty appetites of the soule. Philosophy teacheth, that the understanding naturally thirsteth for truth; the will for that which the understanding apprehendeth to be good, the affections for glory and felici∣ty, the senses for pleasure, the eye for beauty, the eare for harmony, the smell for sweet odours, the taste for delicious meates, the touch for amo∣rous embracings: all these thirsts God doth satisfie and quench after this maner, viz. the thirst of the understanding with his wisedome, of the will with his goodnesse, of the affections with his glory and blessednesse, of the senses with his nature, which containeth in it the quintessence and perfe∣ction of all delectable objects. For as God is in all things, so all things are in him after a more excellent maner than they are in themselves: in themselves they never were without imperfection, nor are since the fall of Adam with∣out impurity and corruption; but in him they are perfect without defect, pure without pollution, permanent and stable without any shadow of change; in regard of which their eminent manner of subsistence in him, they change their names and appellations: and as that which in earthly bodies is matter, the Philosophers call forme, orZab. Phys. lib. de coel. materia formalis in heaven, and parts degrees, and beauty light or clarity, and qualities influences; so that which is accident in the creature, is substance in the Creator: and that which is called beauty in us, is majesty in him; life is immortality, strength omni∣potency, wealth all-sufficiency, delight felicity, affection vertue, vertue na∣ture, nature all things: ForRom. 11.36. of him, and through him, and in him are all things, as the grand master of Philosophy discerned by the glimmering light of reason, saying, that it is manifest, that the Deity is in all things,Arist. mor. ad Eud. . and all things in it: in him the understanding apprehendeth all truth, the will all good, the affections all vertue and glory, the senses all pleasure, the desires all content∣ments; and therefore it followeth, And I desire nothing in the earth with thee. The heart resembleth a perfect triangle, but the figure of the world is circular, and no more can it satisfie the heart of man, than a circle can fill a triangle. God onely, who is a trinity in unity, can fill all the corners of this triangle of his owne making. For no∣thing can delight the spirituall nature of the soule, but a pure spirit: nothing can content the soveraigne faculty of the understanding, but a soveraign ob∣ject: nothing can satisfie the infinite desires of the will, but infinitum bonum; which must be infinite foure waies: 1. In power, to remove all things that may be offensive or hurtfull to us. 2. In bounty, to supply all those good things that may bee delightfull or usefull to us. 3. In essence, to furnish us with infinite variety of delights. 4. In continuance, to perpetuate unto us the infinite variety of continuall delights and contentments. Now, what is there in heaven or in earth thus spirituall in substance, so∣veraigne in place, infinite in power, goodnesse and essence, everlasting in con∣tinuance, but thou, O Lord, whom, because we have in heaven, we desire no∣thing on earth? What should we desire there, where wee find nothing to
fixe our thoughts, or afford us any solid comfort or contentment? Who can aime steadily at a moving mark? or build firmly upon sinking sand? or hold fast a vanishing shadow? or rest himself upon the wings of the wind? as im∣possible is it to lay any sure ground of contentment, or foundation of happi∣nesse in the unstable vanities and uncertaine comforts of this life. How can they fulfill our desires, or satisfie our appetites, which are not only empty, but emptinesse it selfe? How can they establish our hearts, sith they are al∣together unstable themselves? How can they yeeld us any true delight or contentment, which have no verity in them, but are shadowes and painted shewes, like the carved dishes Caligula set before his flatterers; or the grapes drawn by Zeuxis, wherewith he deceived the birds? The best of them are no better than the apples of Sodome, of which Pliny and Solinus write, that they are apples whilest you behold them, but ashes when you touch them: or like the herb Sardoa in Sardinia, upon which if a man feed, it so worketh upon his spleen, that he never leaveth laughing, till he dyeth through immo∣derate mirth. Honours, riches, pleasures are but glorious titles written in golden characters; under them we find nothing but vanity: under the title of nobility nothing but a brag of our parents vertue, and that is vanity; under honour nothing but the opinion of other men, and this can be but vanity; un∣der glory but breath and wind, and this is certainly vanity; under pleasure butEras. Apoph. Demos. Non emam tanti poenitere. repentance & folly, and is not this vanity? under sumptuous buildings, rich hangings, & gorgeous apparrell, but ostentation of wealth and outward pomp, & this is vanity of vanity. Nobility in the originall of it is but the in∣famy of Adam: (for it knew not Hevah till after his fall & grievous prevari∣cation) beauty the daughter of corruption, apparrell the cover of shame, gold & silver the dregs of the earth, oyles & costly ointments the sweat of trees, silkes & velvets the excrements of wormes; and shall our immortall spirit, nobly descended from the sacred Trinity, match so low with this neather world, and take these toyes and trifles for a competent dowry? And let this suffice to be spoken to the words for their full explication; let us now heare what they speake to us for our further use and instruction. 1. They speake to our faith, that it be resolved upon God only. 2. To our devotion, that it be directed to God only. 3. To our love, that it be entirely fixed on God only. 1. True faith saith, Whom have I in heaven but thee to relye upon? 2. True religion saith, Whom have I but thee to call upon? 3. True love saith, Whom have I but thee to settle upon? No Papist can beare a part with David in this song, saying, Whom have I in heaven but thee, O Lord? for they have many in heaven, to whom they addresse their prayers in generall, & often solicite them upon speciall occa∣sions: as for raine, for faire weather, in a common plague, in danger of child-birth, in perills by sea, in perills by land, for their owne health and recovery, and for the safety of their beasts & cattell; as appeares by the forms of pray∣ers yet extant in their Liturgies, Offices, Manuels, & Service books. Doubt∣lesse these monopolies were not granted to Saints in Davids time; for he had recourse every-where to God immediately for any thing he stood in need
of: neither had the ancient Fathers any knowledge of so many new masters of requests in heaven, to preferre their petitions to God: for they addressed themselves all to one Mediatour betwixt God and man, the man Christ Je∣sus, who sitteth at the right hand of his Father, to take all our petitions, & to recommend them unto him. I can make no other construction of the words ofLib. 8. cont. Cel. . Origen, Wee must religiously worship or invocate none but God and his only begotten Son. We must call upon none but God, saithHieron. in Prov. l. 1. c 2. Neminem in∣vocare nisi De∣um debemus. Jerome.Tertul. apol. c. 30. Quaecun∣que hominis & Caesaris vota sunt, haec ab a∣lio orare non possum, quàm à quo scio me consecuturum, quoniam & ip∣se est qui solus praestat, & ego familus ejus qui eum solum invoco. Ter∣tullian goeth farther on our way, We can pray to none other but God: whatsoe∣ver is to be wished for Caesar, as he is a man or a Prince, I cannot begge it of any other than of him from whom I know I shall receive what I aske, because he alone can performe it, and I his servant depend upon none but him. But what stand I upon the testimonies of two or three Fathers? the whole Synod ofTheod. com. in 2. ad Colos. Synodus Lao∣dicea lege pro∣hibuit, ne prae∣carentur An∣gelos, ubi agit de oratoriis Michaelis, & eos perstrin∣git qui dice∣bant oportere per Angelos divinam sibi benevolentiam conciliare. Laodicea condemneth the superstitious errour of some, who taught, that we ought to use Angels as mediatours between God and us, and to pray unto them. And for Saints, who have no more commission to solicit our busines in heaven than Angels, howsoever it pleased the ancient Church to make ho∣nourable mention of them in their publike Service, as we doe of the blessed Virgin, the Archangel, the Apostles & Evangelists; yet S.Aug. l. 22. de civit. Dei c. 10. Martyres suo loco & ordine nominantur, non tamen à Sacerdote qui sacrificat, invo∣cantur. Austin cleareth the Christians of those times from any kind of invocation: The Martyrs, saith he, in their place and ranke are named, yet not called upon by the Priest, who of∣fereth the sacrifice. Invocation is the highest branch of divine worship, and they who bow downe to, and call upon Saints, consequently put Saints in Gods room; & beleeve in them: Quomodo enim invocabunt, in quos non cre∣dunt? HowRom. 10.14. shall they call on them, on whom they have not beleeved? They who call upon Saints deceased, & hope for any benefit by such prayers, must be perswaded that the Saints are present in all places, to heare their prayers, and receive their petitions, and that they understand particularly all their af∣faires, and are privie to the very secrets of their hearts; and is not this to make gods of Saints? Mart. epigr.Qui fingit sacros auro vel marmore vultus, non facit ille deos: qui rogat ille facit. Yea, but say our Romish adversaries, had you a suit to the King, you would make a friend at Court, & employ some in favour with his Majesty to soli∣cit your affaires; why take ye not the like course in your businesse of grea∣ter importance in the Court of Heaven? We answer: First, because God himselfe checketh such carnall imaginations, and over∣throweth the ground of all such arguments by his holy Prophet, saying,Esay 55.8. My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your waies my waies. There∣fore we are brought to the presence of kings (saith S.Amb. in ep. ad Rom. c. 1. Itur ad reges per tribunos, & comites, quia homo utique rex est, ad Deum quem nihil latet promerendum suffragatore non est opus, sed mente de∣votâ. Ambrose) by lords & offi∣cers, because the king is a man; & all cannot have immediate access unto him, neither will he take it well, that all sorts of people at all times should presse upon him: but it is not so with God: he calleth allMat. 11.28.

Whosoever shall call upon the Name, &c. salvation to all that shall so do: neither need we any spokes-man (saith he) to him, save a devout and religious mind. Secondly, admit the proportion to hold between the King of Heaven and
earthly Princes, yet the reason holdeth not: for if the King appoint a cer∣tain officer to take all supplications, and exhibit all petitions unto him, hee will not take it well, if we use any other; but so it is in our present case, God hath appointed us aJohn 14 3. Whatsoever ye shall aske in my Name, hat will I doe. Ver. 6. I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man commeth to the Father but by mee. Mediator not only of redemption, but also ofRom. 8.34.

Wherefore he is able to save them to the ut∣termost, that com unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make interces∣sion for them. able, but most willing to preferre all our suits, & pro∣cure a gracious answer for us: for we have not an high Priest, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin: let us therfore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. Wee know not whether Saints heare us, or rather we know they heare us not: Esay 63.16. Abraham is ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledgeth us not. If they heare us, we know not whether God will heare them for us; but wee know that our Saviour heareth us, and that God alwaies heareth him when he prayeth for us: John 11.42. I know that thou hearest mee alwaies. Yet our Saint-invocators have one refuge to flye unto, and they hold it a very safe one: We call upon the living, say they, to pray for us; why may we not be so far indebted to the Saints departed, who the further they are from us, the neerer they are to God? If it be no wrong to Christs intercession to desire the prayers of our friends in this life, neither can it be any derogation to his Mediatourship to call upon Saints deceased Of this argumentBellar de sanct. beatit. l. 1. c. 19. Bel∣larmine as much braggeth, as Peleus of his sword, Profectò istud argumentum haeretici nunquam solvere potuerunt, the heretickes, saith he, were never able to untie this argument. I beleeve him, because there is no knot at all in it. For, First, we do not properly invocate any man living, , we call to them to assist us with their prayers, we call not upon them, as put∣ting any confidence in them. When at parting we usually cōmend our selves to our friends, and desire them to commend us to God in their prayers, we require of them a duty of Christian charity; we do them therein no honour, much lesse performe any religious service to them, as the Church of Rome doth to Saints deceased. Secondly, when wee pray them to pray for us, wee make this request to them, as co-adjutors, to joyn with us in the duty of praier, not as mediators, to use their favour with God, or plead their merits, as Papists do in their Le∣tanies, adjuring God (as it were) by the faith of Confessors, & constancy of Martyrs, & chastity of virgins, & abstinence of monks, & merits of all Saints. Thirdly, God commandeth the living to have a fellow-feeling of one an∣others miseries, and to2 Cor, 1.11. Phil. 1.4. Cls 4.3. 2 Thes. 3.1. Heb. 13.18. James 5.16. pray one for another; but he no where layeth such an injunction upon the dead to pray for us, or upon us to pray to them: Fourthly, we have many presidents in Scripture of the faithfull, who have earnestly besought their brethren to remember them in theirPhil. 1.19. Gal. 4.3. 2 Thes. 3.1. Philem. 22. Heb. 13.18. prayers; but among all the songs of Moses, psalmes of David, complaints of Jeremy, and prayers of Prophets and Apostles, you shall not find any one directed to any Saint departed; from the first of Genesis to the last Verse of the Apocalypse, there is no precept for the invocation of Saints, no example of it, no promise unto it. Fifthly & lastly, we entreat not any man living to pray for us, but either by word of mouth when he is present with us, or by some friend, who wee know will acquaint him with our desire, or by letters, when we have sure
meanes to conveigh them to him, whereby hee may understand how the case standeth with us, & what that is in particular for which we desire his prayers. All which reasons faile in the invocation of Saints deceased: for wee have no messengers to send to them, nor means to conveigh letters to the place where they are, neither are they within hearing, neither can we be any way assured that they either know our necessities, or are privie to the secrets of our heart. For the Mathematicall glasse, wch some of the Schoolmen have set in heaven, wherein (they say) the Saints in heaven see all things done upon earth, to wit, in God, who seeth all things; it hath bin long since beat into pieces: for I demand, Is this essence of God a necessary glasse, or a voluntary? that is, Do they see all things in it, or such things only as it pleaseth him to present to their view? if they see all things, their knowledge must needs be infinite as Gods is, they must needs comprehend in it all things past, present & future; yea, the thoughts of the heart, wch God peculiarlyApoc. 2.23. I am he that searcheth the heart and reines. assumeth to himself: yea, the day of Judgment, which our Saviour assureth us no man knoweth, not theMat. 24.36 Angels in heaven, nor the son ofMar. 13.32 But of that day and houre knoweth no man, no not the Angels that are in heaven nei∣ther the Son, but the Fa∣ther. man, as man. If they see only such things as God is pleased to reveale un∣to them, how may he that prayeth unto them be assured, that God wil reveale unto them either his wants in particular, or his prayers? how can he pray unto them in faith, who hath no word of faith, whereby hee may be assured either that God revealeth his prayers to them, or that God will accept their prayers for him? Certainly, there was no such chrystal instrument as Papists dream of, to discover unto Saints departed the whole earth, & all things that are in it in the time of Abraham, Isaac, or Josiah: for St. Austin in his book deCap. 13. Si parentes non inter∣sunt, qui sunt alii mortuo∣rum, qui no∣verunt quid agamus, quid ve pati∣amur, & ibi sunt spiritus defuncto∣rum ubi non vidunt quaecunque aguntur, aut evenunt in istâ vitâ ho∣minibus. curâ pro mortuis, out of the second book of Kings, & the 63. of Esay concludeth, that sith kings see not the evils which befal their people after their death; & sith parents are ignorant of their children, without doubt the Saints departed have no intelligence how things pass after their death here upon earth. So far is it frō being a branch of their happines, to know the passages of human affaires here, that S.Jerom. in epitaph. Ne∣pot Foelix Nepo ia∣nus qui haec non audit, non videt. Jerom ma∣keth it a part of their happines, that they are altogether ignorant of them: happy Nepotian, who neither heareth nor seeth any of those things, wch would vexe his righteous soule, & do cause us who see & hear them, often to water our plants. By this which hath bin said, any whose judgements are not fore-stalled, may perceive the impiety of that part of Romish piety which concerneth invocati∣on of Saints; it is not only needless & fruitless, but also superstitious, & most sa∣crilegious: for it robbeth God of a speciall part of his honour, and wrongeth Christ in his office of mediatour. When he holdeth out his golden scepter unto us, & calleth to us, saying, Come unto me, come by me, I am the way, shal we run to any other to bring us to him? shall we seek a way to the way? shall we use me∣diatours to our mediatour? this were to lay a like imputation upon our Redee∣mer, to that which S.De civit. Dei l. 1. In∣terpres deo∣rum eget interprete, & sors ipsa referenda est ad sor∣tes. Austin casteth upon the heathen Apollo, the interpreter of the gods needeth an interpreter, & we are to cast lots upon the lot it selfe. Let it not seem burthensome unto you, my deare brethren, that I speak much in behalf of him, who alone speaketh in behalf of us all: we cannot do our Redeemer a wor∣ser affront, we cannot offer our mediatour a greater wrong, than to goe from him whom God hath appointed our perpetuall advocate & intercessor, & im∣ploy Saints in our suites to God, as if they were in greater grace with the Fa∣ther, or they were better affected to us than he. Have we the like experience of their love as we have of his? did they pawn their lives for us? have they ranso∣med
us with their bloud? will he refuse us, who gave us himselfe? will he not powre out hearty prayers for us, who powred out his heart bloud for us? will he spare breath in our cause, who breathed out his soule for us? shall we forsake the fountain of living water, and draw out of broken cisternes that can hold no wa∣ter? shall we run from the source to the conduit for the water of life? from the sun to the beam for light of knowledge? from the head to the members for the life of grace? from the king to the vassall for a crowne of glory? But I made choice of this Scripture rather to stirre up your devotion, than to beat down Popish superstition; therfore I leave arguments of confutation, & set to motives of perswasion. Look how the Opal presenteth to the eye the beau∣tifull colours of almost all precious stones; so the graces, vertues, & perfections of all natures shine in the face of God to draw our love to him: among which, two most kindle our affection, vertue and beauty; nothing so lovely as vertue, which is the beauty of the mind: & beauty, which is the chief grace and vertue of the body. To give vertue her due, wch is the first place, we speak not so pro∣perly, when we say that God hath any vertue, as when we attribute to him all vertue in the abstract, all wisdom, all justice, all holines, all goodnes. Goodnes is the rule of our will, but Gods will is the rule of goodnes it selfe: we are to doe things because they are just & good; but contrariwise things are just & good be∣cause God doth them; therfore if vertue be the load-stone of our love, it wil first draw it to God, whose nature is the perfection of all vertue. As for beauty, what is it but proportion & colour? the beauty of colour it self is light, & light is but a shadow or obscure delineation of God, whose face darkneth the sun, & dazleth the eies of the Cherubins, who to save them, hold their wings before them like a plume of feathers. A glympse wherof when the Prophet David saw, he was so ravished with it, that as if there were nothing else worthy the seeing, & it were impossible to have enough of so admirable an object, he crieth out,Psa. 105.4. seek his face evermore; not so much for the delight he took in beholding it, as for the light he received from it. For beholding the glory of God as in a mirrour with open face, we are changed into his image, & after a sort made partakers of the divine nature. ô my soul, saith a Saint of God, mark what thou lovest; for thou becom∣mest like to that wch thou likest, Si coelum diligis, coelum es, si terram diligis, ter∣ra es, audeo dicere, si Deum diligis, Deus es; if thou sincerely & perfectly lovest heavenly objects, thou becomest heavenly, if carnall, thou becomest sensuall, if spirituall, thou becomest ghostly, if God, thou becomest divine. Let us stay a while, & consider what a wonderful change is wrought in the soule of man by the power of divine love; surely though a deformed Black-a-moor look his eies out upon the fairest beauty the world can present, hee getteth no beauty by it, but seems the more ougly by standing in sight of so beautiful a creature: the sun burns them black, & darkeneth their sight, who long gaze upon his beams; but contrarily, the Sun of righteousnes the more we looke upon him, the more he enlighteneth the eies,Poulin. in opusc. Illum amemus quem ama∣re debitum, quem am∣plecti cha∣stitas, cui nubere vir∣ginitas, &c. & maketh them fair, & their faces shine who behold him, as Moses his did, after he came down from the Mount where he had parley with God. O then let us love to behold him, the sight of whose countenance will make us fair & lovely to behold: let us conform our selvs to him, who wil trans∣form us into himself: let us reflect the beams of our affection upon the father of lights: let us knit our hearts to him, whom freely to love is our bounden duty, to embrace is chastity, to marry is virginity, to serve is liberty, to desire is content∣ment, to imitate is perfection, to enjoy is everlasting happines. To whom, &c.
THE ROYALL PRIEST. A Sermon preached in Saint Maries Church in Oxford; Anno 1613. THE XXXVII. SERMON. PSAL. 110.4. The Lord sware, and will not repent, thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech. Right Worshipfull, &c. THere are three principall attributes of God, Wisedome, Goodnesse, Power. Wisedome to comprehend all the good that can bee, Goodnesse to will all that which in wisedome he comprehendeth, Power to effect all that in goodnesse he willeth and decreeth for the manifestation of his justice and mercy to his creatures. These three attributes of God shine most clearely in the three offices of Christ, 1 Kingly. 2 Priestly. 3 Propheticall. Power in his Kingly, Wisedome in his Propheticall, Goodnesse in his
Priestly function. For Christ by his Princely authority declareth especi∣ally the power, by his Propheticall he revealeth the wisedome, and by his Priesthood he manifesteth the goodnesse of God to all mankinde. Christ as a Prophet in wisedome teacheth us what in his goodnesse he hath merited for us as a Priest, and by his power he will bestow upon us as a King, free∣dome from all miserie in the Kingdome of glory. And on these three offi∣ces of Christ the three divine graces 1 Faith, 2 Hope, 3 Charity, have a kinde of dependance: 1 Faith holdeth on him as a Prophet. 2 Hope as a King. 3 Charity as a Priest. For Faith buildeth upon the truth of his Prophesie, Hope relieth upon the power of his Kingdome, Charity embraceth the functions of his Priest∣hood, whereby he washeth us from our sinnes in his owne bloud, and ma∣keth usApoc. 1.5, 6. Kings and Priests unto God and his Father. In this Psalme David, as Christs Herauld, proclaimeth these his titles: First, his Kingly; Sit thou on my right hand, ver. 1. Be thou ruler in the midst of thine enemies, ver. 2. Secondly, his Propheticall; The people shall come willingly in the beautie of holinesse, ver. 3. Thirdly, his Priestly; The Lord sware, thou art a Priest, ver. 4. To obscure which most cleare and evi∣dent interpretation of this Propheticall Psalme, although some mists of doubts have beene cast in former times; yet now after the Sun of righte∣ousnesse is risen, and hath dispelled them by his owne beames, nothing without impietie can be opposed to it: forMat. 22.42, 43, 44. there he whom David mean∣eth, openeth Davids meaning; he whom this Prophesie discovereth, disco∣vereth this Prophesie; he to whom this Scripture pointeth, pointeth to this Scripture, and interpreting it of the Son of man, sheweth most evidently that he is the King who reigneth so victoriously, ver. 1. the Prophet that preacheth so effectually, ver. 3. and the Priest that abideth continually, ac∣cording to the words of my text; which offer to our religious thoughts three points of speciall observation: 1 The ceremony used at the consecration of our Lord, The Lord sware. 2 The office conferred upon him by this rite or ceremonie, Thou art a Priest. 3 The prerogatives of this his office; which is here declared to be 1 Perpetuall, for ever, 2 Regular, after the order, 3 Royall, of Melchizedek. First, the forme and manner of our Saviours investiture or consecration was most honourable and glorious, God the Father performing the rites; which were not imposition of hands, and breathing on him the holy Ghost, but a solemne deposition of his Father, with a protestation, Thou art a
Priest: ceremonies never used by any but God, nor in the investiture of a∣ny but Christ, nor his investiture into any office but his Priesthood.Plin. panegyr. Trasan. Impe∣rium super Im∣peratorem Im∣peratoris voce delatum est, & nihil magis subjecti animo factum est, quam quod cae∣pit imperare. At his coronation we heare nothing, but the Lord said, Sit thou on my right hand. The rule of the whole world is imposed upon our Saviour by command; and even in this did Christ shew his obedience to his Father, that he tooke upon him the governement of his Church. But at the consecration of Christ we have a great deale more of ceremonie and solemnity, God his Father taketh an oath, and particularly expresseth the nature and condition of his office, a priesthood after the order of Melchizedek: and he confir∣meth it unto him for ever, saying, Thou art a Priest for ever. Of all which circumstances the Apostle in the Epistle to thec. 7.20, 21. Hebrewes taketh speciall no∣tice, and maketh singular use to advance the Priesthood of Christ above that of Aaron: Inasmuch as Christ was made a Priest, not without an oath, by so much he was made a surety of a better Testament. For those Priests were made without an oath, but he with an oath, by him that said unto him, The Lord, &c. Jehovah is the proper and essentiall name of God, ne∣ver in the Scriptures attributed to any creature, as most of the learned Rabbins and Christian Interpreters observe: a name in such sort adored by the Jewes, that, in a superstitious reverence unto it, wheresoever they meet with it in the text, they either over-skip it, or in place thereof reade Adonai, or Lord: a name also so much admired by the Gentiles, that they called their chiefe God Jove, which is but a contraction of the Hebrew Jehovah. And as they glanced at the very name, so they had a glympse of the reason thereof, as may appeare by Plutarch his exposition of the word , or, Thou art, engraven in golden characters upon the gate of the Temple of Apollo, whereby (saith he) they who came to worship God, acknowledged that Beeing properly belonged to him. Him whom St. John calleth  Par∣menides and Melissus terme , I am (saith God toExod. 3.14. Moses) hath sent thee: and againe, I am that I am. Of all things else we may say truely that they are not that they are, because they are not of themselves, nor are their owne essence, nor continue what they are. God properly is that he is, because himselfe is his owne beeing, and because he is that he was, and was that he is, aad shall be what he was, and is, the same, yesterday, and to day, and for ever. Besides this reason of the name , derived from , God himselfe intimateth another, taken from his faithfulnesse and truth in performing his promises: I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the name of God all-sufficient: but by my nameExod. 6.3. Jehovah was I not knowne unto them; that is, I had not made good my promise unto them, I had not given beeing to my words; that is, I had not performed and accomplished them. According to which etymologie of the word Jehovah, the first straine of this verse soundeth to this tune; Jehovah sware, that is, he that giveth con∣tinuance to all things by his word, he giveth his word for the continuance of this thy sacred office: he who is alwayes as good as his word, nay, who is his word, hath said, nay, hath sworne, Thou art a Priest for ever. The Lord Sware. As we honour God in swearing by him, so the Father honou∣reth the Sonne in swearing to him, or taking a solemn oath at his investiture.
An oath is a sacred forme of speech, in which, for the confirmation of a truth, or assurance of faith, supreme majestie is called upon as a witnesse or surety: this, if it be done by any creature whomsoever, implieth a kinde of adoration of him by whom they sweare; who by this manner of ap∣pealing to him, is tacitly acknowledged to be the Discerner of our thoughts, and supreme Judge of all our actions: and therefore Aquinas defineth ju∣ramentum, adorationis speciem, a kind of adoration. But if supreme Maje∣sty himselfe vouchsafe to use the like forme, he doth not thereby adore himselfe, but most surely bindes himselfe to the performance of that, for which he pawneth as it were his glory and life. Thus St. Austine briefely resolveth the point;Quid est Dei juramentum? promissionis firmamentum: si tu jurando te∣staris Deum, cur non Deus jurando testetur semetiplum? L. 16. de Civit. Dei c 32. Quid est Dei vei veracis{que} juratio, nisi pro∣missi confirma∣tio, & infideli∣um quaedam in∣crepatio? What is Gods oath? (saith he) a solemne kinde of atte∣station to his promise for our greater assurance. As for the manner and forme of this oath, though it be not here set downe, yet it may be easily gathered out of other texts of Scripture. For God alwayes sweareth either by his essence, or by his attributes; by his essence,Ezek. 18.3. As I live, saith the Lord; or by his attributes, either of power, as Esay 62.8. He hath sworne by his strong arme; or by his holinesse,Psal. 22.16. Psal. 89.35 or the like. Whence we may take up this observation by the way, That Gods attributes are his essence, and his essence himselfe. For sith God cannot acknowledge any greater unlesse he should deny himselfe, it followeth, that he cannot sweare by any thing that is not himselfe. If Princes have this priviledge, to confirme all their Proclamations and Pa∣tents with Teste meipso, Witnesse our selves, shall we require farther security from God? Not to beleeve him upon his word, which is all that heaven and earth have to shew for their continuance, were incredulous impietie: to expect or demand further an oath of him by whom we all sweare, were presumptuous insolencie. Yet see how the goodnesse of God overcom∣meth the distrustfulnesse of man; he giveth us more security than we could have had the face to aske, or hope to obtaine; he vouchsafeth not onely a bill of his hand, his written word, but also entereth into bands for the per∣formance of all covenants and grants made to us in the name of our elder brother Christ Jesus. As often as I endevour to stay my thoughts up∣on this point, they breake out into that exclamation ofTertul. l. de peniten c. 4. O beatos nos quorum causâ Deus jurat; O miserrimos, si nec juranti Do¦mino credimus. Tertullian, O thrice happy we, for whose sake God taketh an oath; but most wretched we, if we be∣leeve not God, no not upon his oath. Or the like of Pliny upon occasion of the Emperours deposing before the Consul, O strange thing, and before this time unheard of, he sweareth by whom we all sweare, he confirmeth the Priest∣hood of his sonne by an oath, by whom all oathes are confirmed. In which consideration I marvaile not that Martin Luther was wont to say, he tasted more sweetnesse, and received greater comfort in his meditation upon this parcell of Scripture than any other. For what doctrine doth the whole Scripture affoord so comfortable to a drooping conscience, charged with many foule and grievous sinnes, as this, that God hath sworne his onely be∣gotten Sonne a Priest for ever, to sanctifie our persons, and purge our sins, and tender all our petitions to his Father? What sinne so hainous, what a∣bomination so grievous, for which such a Priest cannot satisfie by the obla∣tion of himselfe? What cause so desperate, in which such an Advocate, if he plead, will not prevaile? What suit so difficult, which such a Me∣diatour
will not carry? We may be sure God will not be hard to be intrea∣ted of us, who himselfe hath appointed us such an Intercessour, to whom he can deny nothing. Therefore surely if there be any Balme in Gilead, it may be found on, or gathered from the branches of this text, The Lord sware, And will not repent. Is not this addition needlesse and superfluous? Doth God ever repent him of any thing? May wee be bold to use any such speech concerning God, that he repented or retracted any thing? We may, the Scripture will beare us out in it, which in many places warranteth the phrase; as,Gen. 6.6. Then it repented the Lord that he had made man upon the earth, and he was sorrie in his heart: and,1 Sam. 15.35 It repenteth me that I have made Saul King; for he is turned from me, and hath not performed my commandements: and,Psal. 106.15. He remembred his covenant, and repented, according to the multitude of his mercies: and,Jer. 18.10. If this Nation, against whom I have pronounced, turne from their wickednesse, I will repent of the plagues that I thought to bring up∣on them; but if they doe evill in my sight, I will repent of the good that I thought to doe unto them: therefore now amend your wayes and your works, and heare the word of the Lord God, that the Lord may repent him of the plagues that he hath pronounced against you: and,Jon. 3.9. God saw their workes, that they turned from their evill wayes, and God repented of all the evill that he had said he would do unto them, and he did it not. All which passages I have entirely re∣lated, quia de Deo etiam vera dicere periculosum est, as the heathenHil. de Trin. l. 5. Non po∣test Deus nisi per Deum in∣telligi, à Deo discendum est quid de Deo in∣telligendum est Sage wise∣ly observeth, It is dangerous to speake even true things of God; for we may speake nothing safely of him which is not spoken by him in holy Scriptures. And above others the Ministers of the Gospel have a speciall charge gi∣ven them, not onely to looke to their matter, but to have a care also, retinere sanam formam verborum, to keepe unto a wholesome platforme of words and phrases, such as all those are which the holy Ghost hath sanctifi∣ed unto us, whereof this is one, God repented, &c. which may be safely uttered, if it be rightly understood. Certaine it is, and a most undoubted truth, that the nature of God is free from passion, his actions from excepti∣on, his will from controll, his purpose from casualty, his sentence from revocation; and therefore when God is said in holy Scripture to repent of any good by him promised, or actually conferred upon any, or any evill inflicted or menaced, we are not from thence to inferre, that there are any after-thoughts in God, but onely some alteration in the things themselves. As Parents and Nurses, that they may be the better understood of their In∣fants, clip their words, or speake in a like tone to them; so also our heaven∣ly Father, , that we may the better understand him, speaketh to us in our owne language,Num. 23.19. God is not a man that hee should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent: hath he said, and shall be not doe it? hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? and expresseth himselfe in such termes as best sort with our conceits and apprehensions. When we condemne the courses which we have formerly taken, or undoe any thing which we have done, our after-thoughts checke our former, and we retract our errour; and this retraction of our opinions, and change in our minde, we call repentance: which, though it be farre from the nature of God, yet is it by a figure at∣tributed unto him, the more significantly to expresse his infinite hatred and detestation of sin, in regard whereof he cast man out of his favour, as if he had repented that he had made him: he cast Saul out of his throne, as if
he had repented that he had set him in it: as also to represent his compassi∣onate love towards penitent sinners, which prevaileth so farre with him, that upon the least relenting and humiliation on our parts, he reverseth the fearefull sentence he passed upon us, as if it repented him that he ever had pronounced it. We repeale some act or constitution of ours, or cancell some deed, because we repent of that which formerly we had done: but God is said to repent, not because his minde or affection is changed, but because his actions are such, as when the like are done by men they truely repent. Thus St.L. 9. de Civ. Dei. Poeniten∣tiae nomen u∣surpavit effe∣ctus, non illius turbulentus af∣fectus. Austine resolveth the case, Some such effects, which in men proceed from repentance, descried in the Actions of God, have oc∣casioned these and the like phrases, God repented, and was sorrie in his heart. Yea, but what effects are these? Hath he ever reversed any sentence, re∣pealed any act, nay, recalled so much as any word passed from him? Is the1 Sam. 15.29. strength of Israel as man that he should lie, or as the sonne of man that hee should repent? Is not hee theHb. 13.8. same yesterday, and to day, and for ever? Are not all his menaces and promises, all his mercies and judgements, all his words and workes2 Cor. 1.20. For all the pro∣mises of God in him are Yea, and in him A∣men, unto the glory of God by us. Yea and Amen? Doubtlesse it shall stand for an un∣moveable truth, when heaven and earth shall passe away, Mal. 3.6. Ego Deus, non mutor, I am the Lord, I change not: therefore we are yet in the suds, there appeareth no ground to fasten repentance upon God, either quoad affectum, or quoad effectum. But here theAquin. par. 1. q. 16. art. 7. Ali∣ud est mutare voluntatem, ali∣ud velle muta∣tionem. Schoolemen reach us a distinction to take hold on, whereby we may get out of the mire: It is one thing to change the will, and another thing to will a change. God willeth a change in some things at some times, but he never changeth his will. Some things God appointeth to continue for ever, as the dictates of the law of nature, and the Priesthood of Christ: some things for a time onely, as the Legall Ceremonies, and the Aaronicall Priesthood. Againe, some things he promiseth absolutely, as all spirituall graces necessary to the salvation of the Elect: some things conditionally, as the blessings of this life, so farre as they tend to the attaining of a better hereafter. In like manner, some judgements he denounceth absolutely, as the destruction of the king∣dome of Satan and Antichrist; others upon condition expressed or under∣stood, as the subversion of Niniveh, the present death of Hezekiah. To apply these distinctions to our purpose, and close upon the very point in question: when any order, set downe by God for a time, altereth at the time, the date being expired, or any Prophesie depending upon a condition, falleth with it, God is said to repent, though he indeed doe nothing lesse; the change that appeares in the things themselves being nothing else but the execution of an unchangeable decree of God for their change. The meaning then of this phrase, will not repent, is, that the Priesthood of Christ is not like that of Aaron, which was after a time to expire, and is now actu∣ally with all the ceremoniall law abolished, but a Priesthood never to be al∣tered or changed. The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a Priest. There are three things that especially appertained to the office of Aaron and his Successours: 1 To keepe the originall and authenticall copie of the law, together with the golden pot of Manna, and the two tables written with the finger of God, and the Rod that budded.
2. To offer sacrifices both ordinary every day, and upon their set feasts and sabbaths, and extraordinary upon speciall occasions. 1. Either to professe their thankfulnesse to God, and mag∣nifie his goodnesse; which may be called gratulatory, or eucharisticall. 2. Or to confesse their sins and appease his wrath; which are called expiatory, or propitiatory. 3. To present themselves before God for the people, to assure on their part obedience to God, by way of promise or stipulation, and procure Gods favour to them by way of mediation. All which parts of their Priestly function they performed but typical∣ly and imperfectly: for neither did they keep the Law entirely, nor so much as the copy of it in later times, neither did their sacrifices purge thoroughly, neither did their prayers prevaile effectually: but our high Priest hath fulfilled all righteousnesse, and by one oblation of himselfe hath made a perfect satisfaction for the sins of the whole world: and he is in that grace and favour with God, that he putteth up no petition on our behalfe, but hee getteth it signed by his Father. The Leviticall Priests laid up the true originall of the Law, both written in the bookes of Moses, and engra∣ven in the two Tables, in the Arke, as a jewell in a sacred casket: but our high Priest both kept the Law it selfe, and perfectly fulfilled it, and wri∣teth it also in the tables of our hearts: they presented offerings for the sin of the soule, but he made his soule an offering for sinne:Esay 53.10. they appeared but once a yeere in the Holy of holies for the people, but hee being entred into the Sanctum sanctorum, the Heaven of heavens, sits at the right hand of his Father, and perpetually by the merits of his passion intercedeth for us. Now the reasons which moved him to take upon him this office of a Priest, are conceived to be these: 1. Because the salvation and redemption of mankind, wrought by the sacrifice of his Priesthood, being a most noble worke, and not inferiour to the creation, it was not fit that any should have the honour of it but the Son of God. 2. Neither was it agreeable that any should offer him, who was the only sacrifice that could expiate the sinnes of the whole world, but him∣selfe: therefore by offering himselfe, he added infinite worth to the sacri∣fice, and great honour to the Priesthood of the Gospel. For, as the gold sanctified not the altar, but the altar the gold; so it may be truly said with∣out impeachment to the dignity of that calling, that Christ was rather an honour to the Priesthood, than the Priesthood an addition unto him. For what got he by the Priesthood, which cost him his life? what preferment could it be to him, to take upon him an office, whereby hee was to abase himselfe below himself, and be put to an ignominious and accursed death? What were we vile miscreants, conceived and borne in originall sinne, and soyled with the filth of numberlesse actuall transgressions, that to purge and cleanse our polluted soules and defiled consciences, the second person in
Trinity should be made a Priest? It was wonderfull humility in him to wash his Disciples feet, but in his divine person to wash our uncleane soules, is as farre above humane conceit, as it seemeth below divine maje∣sty. There is nothing so impure as a fowle conscience, no matter so filthy, no corruption so rotten and unsavoury as is found in the sores of an exulce∣rated mind; yet the Sonne of God vouchsafed to wash and bathe them in his owne bloud. O bottomlesse depth of humility and mercy! other Priests were appointed by men for the service of God, but hee was appoin∣ted by God for the service and salvation of men: other Priests spilt the bloud of beasts to save men, but he shed his owne bloud to save us, more like beasts than men: other Priests offered sacrifice for themselves, he of∣fered himselfe for a sacrifice: other Priests were fed by the sacrifices which the people brought, but he feeds us with the sacrifice of his owne body and bloud: Lastly, others were appointed Priests but for a time, hee was ordained a Priest For ever. The rod of Aaron was a type of the Priesthood of Christ, which shooteth forth three buds or blossomes: 1. Obedience, the fruit whereof is our righteousnesse. 2. Sacrifice, the fruit whereof is our satisfaction. 3. Intercession, the fruit whereof is our confidence and bold accesse to the throne of grace. The two first buds seemed to wither at our Saviours death, though the fruit thereof be still preserved, but the third, though it put it selfe forth in his life time, yet it more flourished after his ascension. For although our blessed Redeemer now no more observe the ceremoniall Law, to which he gave a period at his consummatum est, nor offer any more sacrifice of his owne, yet he still offereth up our sacrifices of praises and thanksgiving, he still presenteth us unto God, and laboureth to reconcile God unto us; hee layes open before his Father his bloudy wounds and stripes, and by them beseecheth him to have mercy upon us; and in this respect, as well because the dignity of his Priesthood still remaines in himselfe, and the effect in us, as because continually he blesseth us, and mediateth for us, he is stiled a Priest for ever: not such a Priest as the Levites were, who held their office for their life, and after left it to their successors, who were in the end to re∣signe it into the hands of a Mediatour; but such a Priest as Melchizedek was, a singular Priest, an everlasting Priest, a royall Priest, a Priest who nei∣ther succeeded any, nor any him, a Priest for ever After the order of Melchizedek. For the opening of this passage three points are to be cleared: 1. The name. 2. The person. 3. The order or office of this singular and extra∣ordinary type of Christ. 1. Touching the name, though it bee one word in the Greeke and La∣tine,
and carry the forme of a proper name, yet in the originall it is two; , and seemeth rather to be an appellative, signifying my righte∣ous Lord, or the righteous Lord of my appointment: as Psal. 2.6. I have set my King, &c. Howbeit, as the name of Augustus was the common stile of all the Romane Emperours, yet  the sirname of Octavius, from whom the rest received it; so it is not unlikely, that the stile of Melchize∣dek was at the first attributed to this famous King of Salem, who met A∣braham with a present as he returned from the slaughter of the Kings; yet afterwards, either by adulation, or for other reasons, it might be given to his successors. Of the interpretation of this name we can make no doubt, sith the Apo∣stle hath construed it unto us (viz.)Hebr 7.2. King of righteousnesse, and after that, King of Salem, which is King of peace; whence some gather consequent∣ly, that the most righteous Kings are most peaceable, and that hee can bee no King of peace, who is not a King of righteousnesse. Where righteous∣nesse doth flourish, there shall be abundance of peace. As in the name of Melchizedek King of Salem, so in the heart of every good King righte∣ousnesse and peace ought to kisse each other. Now Christ is a King of righ∣teousnesse in three respects: 1. Administrando, because he administreth. 2. Operando, because he wrought and still worketh. 3. Imputando, because he imputeth righteousnesse. He administreth righteousnesse, because hee ruleth his Church with aPsal. 45 6. The scepter of thy Kingdome is a right scep∣ter. scepter of righteousnesse: he wrought righteousnesse in fulfilling the Law, which is calledMat. 3.15. Thus it becom∣meth us to ful∣fill all righte∣ousnesse. righteousnesse, and by his grace also he enableth us to work righteousnesse, and in some good measure to fulfill his commandements: he imputeth righteousnesse, when he justifieth the ungodly, and accoun∣teth faith forRom. 4.5. righteousnesse to him that worketh not, but beleeveth: for God made him that knew no sinne, to be2 Cor. 5.21. sinne for us, that wee might be made the righteousness of God in him, that no flesh should glory in his presence: for of him are1 Cor. 1.30. we in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisedome, and righteousnes, and sanctification, and redemption. 2. Tovching the person of Melchizedek, there are sixe opinions: the first, 1. Of certaine Heretickes, called the Melchizedekians, who taught, that Melchizedek was aEpiph. hae∣res. 55. power of God greater than Christ, and that hee was the Mediatour and Advocate of Angels, as Christ is of men. 2. Of Hierax the Egyptian and his followers, who taught, that Melchi∣zedek wasYstella in Gen. 14. Christ himselfe, who before his incarnation appeared in a hu∣mane shape to Abraham. 3. Of the author of the booke, q. Vet. & N. Test. who writeth, that Melchizedek is the Holy Ghost. 4. Of Origen and Didymus, who thought Melchizedek to be anHieron. ep. ad Evag. Angel. 5. Of Aben Ezra, Bagud Haturim, Levi Benyerson, David Chimki, and of theJer. & E∣piph. loc sup. cit. Samaritans and Hebrewes generally, who confidently affirme, that Melchizedek was Shem the son of Noah.
6. OfCoel. hierarc. c. 9. Haeres. 55. in Gen. 14. Dionysius Areopagita, Epiphanius, Theodoret, Hippolytus, Pro∣copius, Eusebius, Eustathius, Calvin, Junius, Musculus, Mercerus, Pereri∣us, Pareus, and divers others, who hold it most probable that this Mel∣chizedek was one of the Kings of Canaan. In this variety of opinions, backed with manifold authorities, as Tully spake of the soule, that it was lesse difficult to resolve what she is not, than what she is; so we may say of Melchizedek, that it is a far easier matter to determine who he was not, than who he was. 1. He was not any power of God greater than our Saviour, or the Angels Advocate: for neither is there any inequality between the divine persons, neither have the evill Angels any Advocate to plead for them, who are condemned already, and reserved in chaines of darkness till the great day. The text of Scripture which they wrested to their fancy, no way advan∣tageth them. For Christ is said, a Priest after the order of Melchizedek, not because he was inferiour to him in person or office, but because he succee∣ded him in time, and bare an office framed after a sort according to the pat∣terne of his. 2. He was not the Sonne of God, the second person in Trinity: for the type must needs be distinguished from the truth; but Melchizedek was a glorious type of Christ, and is saidHebr. 7.3. . assimilari, to be likened to the Son of God: he was not therefore the Son of God, but his fore-runner in the of∣fice of Priesthood. 3. He was not the Holy Ghost; for Moses describeth him to bee a man that ruled in Salem, and executed also the office of a Priest to God: which cannot be affirmed of the Holy Ghost, who never tooke our nature upon him, nor is any where in holy Scripture termed a Priest of the most high God. The onely footing which this opinion hath, is upon that ground, that Melchizedek is said to beHebr. 7.3. without father; which ground no way sup∣porteth this opinion. For wee cannot argue from one attribute of Melchi∣zedek affirmatively, though we may negatively. This argument is good, He that hath a father reckoned among men, is not Melchizedek; but this is not so, The Holy Ghost is without father, therefore he is Melchizedek. For God the Father, the first person in Trinity is, as also Adam the first man was, without father or mother, yet neither of them Melchizedek. 4. He was not an Angel: for it is a thing unheard of in the Church of God, that the angels of heaven should sway earthly scepters, or discharge the fun∣ction of Priests. What have Angels of heaven to do with feasting armies, or receiving tythes of spoyles, as Melchizedek did from the hands of A∣braham? These foure opinions have been long agoe exploded, the two re∣maining stand still in competition for the truth. 5. The advocates for Sem plead hard: Sem (say they) as appeareth in the story of Genesis, lived to the time of Abrahams victory, & to him it was promised, that the Canaanites should be his servants, and consequently that Salem their Metropolis should be his seat, where Melchizedek was King. Neither was there any greater man than Abraham, to whom that great Patriarch should doe homage, and pay tythes, save Sem. Lastly, those pre∣rogatives of Melchizedek (without father, without mother, without beginning of dayes, or end of life) agree best to Sem, who might be said to be without
these, either in the notice of the text, or in the speech of men: because he was now so aged, and had lived so long after the Floud, that no man then living remembred his Parents. He might likewise be said to be without beginning of dayes in respect of the new world after the Floud, and without end of life in respect of the old world before the Floud. Notwithstanding all these allegations in the behalfe of Sem, the truth goeth not so cleare for him, but that it is encountred with many and great difficulties. For there is no ground to beleeve that Sem left the East, and set up his rest inCalvin. in Gen. 14. Ne{que} enim virum ae∣ternâ memoriâ dignum, Do∣minus novo tantum & ob∣scuro nomine indicasset, ut maneret igno∣tus; ne{que} proba∣bile est Semum ex Oriente mi∣grasse in Judae∣am. Judea: neither is it likely that the Spirit would have de∣scribed a man worth eternall memorie in such an obscure manner, and under such a new name, that he remaines yet unknowne. Were he Sem, why should Moses conceale his name? Moreover, the Apostle in the seventh of theVer. 6. Hebrewes saith in expresse words, that the pedegree of Melchizedek is not accounted among men; but Sems is, as we reade inGen. 10.22. Genesis: neither is it a solid answer, which yet is given by many learned men, to say that Sems genealogie is not accounted by the name of Melchizedek. For no more is Jacobs accounted by the name of Israel, yet none thereupon would say that Jacobs genealogie is not set downe by Moses. The Apostles com∣parison standeth not in the bare name, but in the person of Melchizedek: whether by the name of Melchizedek, or by the name of Sem his pede∣gree be set downe, it is certaine hee cannot be that man whom St. Paul in this resembleth to Christ, that he was without father or mother accounted among men, for his Parents are upon record. 6 What then shall we conclude? Either that he was a Ruler of Canaan,Confirm. 6. whose genealogie is no where set downe, nor the day of his birth nor death; or that he was a man immediately sent from God, and shewed one∣ly to the earth, and afterwards taken away after the maner of Enoch, or E∣lias, that he might be likened in all things to the Sonne of God; or that the Apostle hath an eye onely to Moses his relation, in that place where Mel∣chizedek is brought in by him, blessing Abraham, and receiving tithes from him, without any mention there of his Parents in the flesh, or succes∣sour in his office, or day of his birth or death. So are wee to conceive of our high Priest, who was without father according to his manhood, with∣out mother touching his Godhead, and in his person, which was meerely di∣vine, without beginning of dayes, or end of yeeres. 3 Touching his order or offices, it is certaine that he was both King and Priest. For he was King of Salem, and Priest of the most high God: the conjunction of which two offices was not unusuall in those elder times a∣mong the heathen: for by the light of nature they saw such majestie in the person of a King, and eminencie in the office of a Priest, that they judged none so worthy of the Priesthood as their Kings, nor any so capable of the Kingdome as their Priests: and therefore in most places they either crowned their Priests and gave them power; or sacred their Kings, and gave them orders. Right so doth Virgil describe Anius, as Moses doth Melchizedek, invested with both dignities: Virg. Aen. 3.Rex idem Anius, Phoebi{que} Sacerdos. At this day the Kings of the East Indians are stiled Brameres, that is,
Priests, and by the law are to die in a holy place, as persons sacred to God.Arist. pol. . Aristotle remembreth such an ancient custome among the Grecians, Res divinae committebantur Regibus; andCic. pro dom. ad Pontif. Cum multa divinitus a majoribus nostris inventa atque instituta sunt, tum nihil praelarius quam quod e∣osdem religio∣nibus deorum immortalium & summae reip. prae esse volue∣runt. . Vid. Lips. polit. l. 4 c. 1. Tullie among the Romans: and Stobeus setteth a faire colour upon it, The best of all, that is, God, ought to be honoured and served by the best, that is, the Prince; and the service of God, which is or should be, in all well ordered States, the chiefest of all cares, ought to be the care of the chiefest, that is, the King: which made Lycurgus, the Law-giver of the Lacedaemonians, ambitious of the title of the Priest of Apollo, and Solon of Priest of Minerva, and induced Mercurius Trismegistus, Au∣gustus, Titus, and Trajan, to assume this sacred title into their stile, and an∣nexe the Priesthood to the Crowne. Ovid. Fast. l. 1. & l. 3. Et fiunt ipso sacra colente Deo.Accessit titulis Pontificalis honos. Wherein they may all seeme to have taken Melchizedek for their patterne, who the first of all that ever we reade, mingled both oyles, and compassed the Mitre with a Crowne; bearing a Scepter in one hand, and a Crozure in the other, more fully to represent the Sonne of God, who remaineth a Priest, and reigneth a King for ever. This resemblance betweene them satisfieth not our Adversaries, they straine this text hard to draw bloud from it, even the bloud of Christ sacri∣ficed in the Masse. If (say they) Christ be a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek, then he must daily offer a sacrifice unto God under the formes of bread and wine, as also did Melchizedek. And this is the fairest evidence they bring out of Scripture for the sacrifice of the Masse. Against which we object, 1 That neither the Hebrew letter, nor the vulgar Latine, the authority whereof no Papist dare impeach, importeth that Melchizedek offered bread and wine, butGen. 4.18. brought forth; protulit, non obtulit. 2 Admit of the word offered; what say they to Rabbi Solomon, Tertulli∣an, Ambrose, yea, Andradius also, and other Papists of note, who referre this offering to Abraham, not to God? the bread and wine he offered was a present to Abraham, not a sacrifice to God. Obtulit (say they) Abraha∣mo panem & vinum; and will they make no difference betweene an office of civility and a sacrifice of religion? 3 Admit Melchizedek offered this bread and wine, or some part of it, to God, yet doth not the Spirit of God recommend his Priesthood, as being any way remarkable for the sacrifice he offered, but for the blessing where∣with he blessed Abraham. For so it followeth in the text, ver. 19, 20. And he was the Priest of the most high God, and he blessed him, and said, &c. And from this act of his office the Apostle inferreth, thatHb. 7.7. Melchizedek was a Priest of a higher order and ranke than Levi, who blessed him in the loynes of Abraham, and received tithes from him: Without contradiction, saith the Apostle, the lesse is blessed of the greater. 4 Admit that his Priesthood were as remarkeable for his offering, as for his blessing, yet all this comes short of the point in question, to prove that Christ is said to be a Priest after the order of Melchizedek, in regard of his sacrifice of bread and wine. For Christ never offered a sacrifice of bread
and wine, as we are all upon an accord, the sacrifice which he offered was his body and bloud. 5. Had he offered at his last Supper a sacrifice of bread and wine, and not instituted a Sacrament in bread and wine, yet that offering would not intitle him to the Priesthood of Melchizedek, more than to the Priesthood of Levi. For the Priests of the Law also offered bread and wine. Doubtlesse there must be something eminent and extraordinarie in the Priesthood of Melchizedek, in regard whereof Christ is said to be a Priest after his order: and we need not seek far for singular resemblances between them, the Apo∣stle hath excellently paralleled them in the seventh of the Hebrewes. 1 Melchizedek, by interpretation King of righteousnesse: Christ, The Lord our righteousnesse. 2 Melchizedek, King of Salem: Christ, the Prince of peace. 3 Melchizedek, without genealogie reckoned among men: Christ, without Father touching his manhood, without mother tou∣ching his Godhead. 4 Melchizedek blesseth Abraham: Christ blesseth all the seed of the faithfull Abraham. 5 Melchizedek, a patterne without patterne, and president without a∣ny former president: Christ made after an order, after which there was no order. To contract all in briefe: Melchizedek was a Priest, 1 Singular in his person: for he neither succeeded any, nor any him. 2 Royall in his place: for his Kingdome was his Diocesse. 3 Perpetuall in his office: for his Priesthood was never abrogated. And in these respects chiefly Christ is stiled a Priest after the order of Mel∣chizedek, that is to say, a Singular Everlasting Royall Priest Had there beene yet a more speciall and remarkeable agreement between Christ and Melchizedek in regard of the sacrifice of bread and wine, how commeth it to passe that the Apostle omitteth it, where professedly hee compareth them, and maketh use even of nominall conveniences betweene them? He who presseth verball congruities, would he have pretermitted any reall, especially such an one, as, if it were true, were more remarke∣able than all the rest? viz. that as Melchizedek offered no flesh of beasts to God, or bloudy sacrifice, but bread and wine; so Christ at his last Sup∣per offered himselfe, and hath commanded the Priests of the Gospell to the end of the world to offer a daily unbloudie sacrifice, under the formes of bread and wine.
They will peradventure replie, that though the Apostle for some speciall reason pretermitted this resemblance betweene them, yet the ancient Fa∣thers have not baulked it. For St.Ep. l. 2. ep. 3. ad Cecil. Sacri∣ficium Deo pa∣tri obtulit, & obtulit hoc i∣dem quod Mel∣chizedek. Cyprian saith in expresse termes, that Christ offered a sacrifice to God his Father, and he offered the same which Melchizedek had done, to wit, bread and wine. And St.Hieron. ep. ad Mrc. Melchi∣zedek in typo Christi panem & vinum obtu∣lit, & mysteri∣u Christia∣norum in Sal∣vtoris corpore & sanguine de∣dicavit. Jeromes words are as direct, Melchizedek in a figure offered bread and wine, and dedicated the mysterie of Christians in the body and bloud of our Saviour. And EusebiusEuseb. Emis∣sen. Serm. 5. de Pasch. Melchi∣zedek oblatio∣ne panis & vini Christi sacrifi∣cium figuravit. Emissenus speaketh as fully as either St. Cyprian or St. Jerome; Melchize∣dek in offering bread and wine prefigured Christs sacrifice. This I confesse is the language of some of the Ancients, whose words notwithstanding, though put upon the tentors of a Jesuiticall interpretation, and stretched to the utmost, will not reach home to their purpose. For they passe not be∣yond one of these points, either that Christ resembleth Melchizedek in this, that as Melchizedek brought forth bread and wine to refresh Abra∣ham and his armie; so he at his last Supper brought forth bread and wine before his Disciples, and instituted a Sacrament by them to refresh their soules: or that Christ offered that in substance and veritie which Mel∣chizedek offered in type and figure, to wit, his bodie and bloud. Thus St. Cyprian expresseth himselfe in the same sentence, saying, He offered the same which Merchizedek did, bread and wine, suum scilicet corpus & sangui∣nem, to wit, his body and bloud. And the Author of the Treatise De coena Domini, who carrieth the name of St.Cypr. de unct. Chris. Dedit i∣ta{que} Dominus noster in mensâ in quà ultimum cum Discipulis participavit convivium pro∣priis manibus panem & vi∣num, in Cruce verò manibus militum corpus tradidit vulne∣randum, ut A∣postolis secreti∣us impressa sin∣cera veritas, & vera sinceritas exponeret gen∣tibus, quomodo panis & vinum caro esset & sanguis, & qui∣bus rationibus causae effectibus convenirent, & diversa nomina vel species ad u∣nam reduceren∣tur essentiam, & significantia & significata isdem vocabu∣lis censerentur. Cyprian, very well cleareth the mat∣ter, saying, Christ at his last Supper delivered with his owne hands bread and wine to his Disciples, but on the Crosse rendred his body into the hands of the Souldiers, to be wounded and crucified, to verifie the type, and accomplish the figure, and fully resemble the patterne of Melchizedek. And this may serve for the sense and construction of this text of Scripture: let us now see how it may serve for our use and instruction. First, it instructeth us in the lawfull use of an oath, which is here warran∣ted by the practice of God himselfe, Juravit Jehova, The Lord sware. Secondly, in the certaintie of our salvation, grounded upon the immuta∣bility of Gods purpose, He will not repent. Thirdly, in the dignity of the Priesthood of the Gospell, which was the calling of our blessed Lord and Saviour, Thou art a Priest. Fourthly, in the abrogation of all legall rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices, by the perpetuall Priesthood of Christ. But because these are pathes trod by every one, I will proceed to the three last observations. Fifthly, in the necessitie of order in the Church, Sacerdos secundum ordi∣nem. Though Christ were a singular and extraordinarie Priest, yet he had a president, and was made after an order: he who ordaineth all, would be or∣dained himselfe, to establish order in the Ministerie. As Christ himselfe, so all Ministers of holy things, must be secundum ordinem, after some order. I demand then after what order our Popist Priests are made? whether after the order of Aaron or Melchizedek? If after the order of Aaron, then are they to offer bloudie sacrifices, and performe other carnall rites, long agoe abrogated: if after the order of Melchizedek, then they are very happie. For then they are to be Kings and Priests, then they are not to succeed any other, nor any other them: then, as hath beene shewed, they are singular,
everlasting, and royall Priests. We may put a like interrogatorie to many of our Brownists or Anabaptisticall Teachers, who run before they are sent, and answer before they are called; being like wandering starres, fixed in no certaine course; or wilde corne, growing where they were not sowne; or like unserviceable pieces of Ordnance, which flie off before they are discharged. If men, though endowed with gifts, might discharge a Pasto∣rall function, or doe the worke of an Evangelist, without a lawfull mission, St. Pauls question had beene to little purpose,Rom. 10.15. How shall they preach un∣lesse they be sent? What calling have these men? ordinarie or extraordi∣narie? If ordinarie, where are their orders? if extraordinarie, where are their miracles? If Christ himselfe would not take upon him the Priest∣hood till he was called thereunto, as Aaron, what intolerable presumption is it in these, not to take, but to make their owne commission, and to call men by the Gospell without a calling according to the Gospell. It is not more unnaturall for a man to beget himselfe, than to ordaine himselfe a Priest. But because these men will not be ordered by reason, I leave them to au∣thority, and come to the Sixth observation, which is the Prerogative of Christ,Obs. 6. who was ordai∣ned a Priest of Melchizedeks order, whereby he was qualified to beare both offices, Kingly and Priestly. For that Christ alone may execute both charges, besides the faire evidence of this Scripture, Uzziahs judgement maketh it a ruled case, who presuming to burne incense to the Lord, incen∣sed the wrath of God against himselfe. A rare and singular judgement, and worthy perpetuall memorie; he who, not content to sway the royall Scep∣ter, would lay hold on the Censer, and discharge both offices, was for ever discharged of both: and even then when he tooke upon him to cleanse the people, was smitten with a foule and unclean2 Chr. 26.20. disease. So dangerous a thing is it, even for Soveraigne Princes, the Lords Annointed, to encroach upon the Church, and assume unto themselves and usurpe Christs prerogative. Whereof the Bishops of Roane and Rhemes were bold to bid their Sove∣reigne Lewis, the then French King, beware, informing him, Quod solus Christus fieri potuit Rex & Sacerdos, that it was the prerogative of Christ alone to beare both offices. And PopeCausab. l. de libert. Eccles. Gratian. dist. 96. cum ad ve∣rum. Nicolas himselfe concurreth with them in judgement; When the truth, that was Christ, saith he, was once come, after that neither did the Emperour take upon him the Bishops right, nor the Bishop usurp the Emperours, because the same Mediatour of God and man, the man Christ Jesus, distinguisheth the offices of each power, assigning unto them proper actions, to the end that the Bishop, which is a souldier of Christ, should not wholly intangle himselfe in worldly affaires: and againe, the Prince, which is occupied in earthly matters, should not be ruler of divine things, viz. the preaching of the Word, and administration of the Sacraments. To make a medley (saithSyn. p. Synesius) of spirituall and temporall power, is . There is great difference between the Scepter and the Censer; the Chaire of Moses, and the Throne of David; the tongue of the Minister, and the hand of the Magistrate; the materiall sword that killeth, and the spirituall that quickeneth. To the King (saith St.De verb. Esa. Chrysostome) are the bodies of men committed, to the Priest their soules: the King pardoneth civill offen∣ces and crimes, the Priest remitteth the guilt of sinne in the conscience: the
King compelleth, the Priest exhorteth: the Kings weapons are outward and materiall, the Priests inward and spirituall. A like distinction St.Hieron. ad Heliod Rex nolentibus praeest, Episco∣pus volentibus, &c. Jerome maketh betweene them; The King ruleth men, though unwilling, the Bishop can doe good upon none but those that are willing: the King holdeth his sub∣jects in awe with feare and terrour, the Priest is appointed for the service of his flocke: the King mastereth their bodies with death, the Priest preserveth their soules to life. But the farthest of any St.Bern. de con∣sid. ad Eugen. Reges gentium dominanturs, vos non sic; au∣de ergo usur∣pare, aut Do∣minus Aposto∣latum, aut Apo∣stolicus Domi∣natum. Bernard presseth this point, and toucheth Pope Eugenius to the quicke: It is the voice of the Lord, Kings of the Nations rule over them, &c. But it shall not be so with you; goe to then, usurp if thou dare, either an Apostleship, if thou art a Lord; or Lordlike dominion, if thou art an Apostle: thou art expressely forbid both: if thou wilt have both, thou shalt lose both. But why doe I prosecute this point? Doth it concerne any now adayes? Doth any one man beare both these offices? I answer affirmatively, the High-priest at Rome doth. For he compasseth his Mitre with a triple Crown: and, as if he bare this name written upon his thigh, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, challengeth to himselfe a power to depose Kings, and dispose of their Kingdomes. Doth any one desire to know who is that man of sinne, spoken of by the2 Thes. 2.3. Apostle, who opposeth and exalteth himselfe above all that is called God? Let him learne of the Prophet who are called gods, (Dixi dii estis,Psal. 82.6. I have said ye are gods) and it will be no matter of great diffi∣cultie to point at him who accounteth that hee doth Kings a great honour when he admitteth them to kisse his feet, hold his stirrop, serve him at table, and performe other baser offices, prescribed in their booke of ceremonies. I can tell you who it was that made the Emperour Henrie the fourth, with his Queene and young Prince, in extreme frost and snow, to waite his leisure three dayes, barefooted and in woollen apparell, at the gates of Canusium: it was Gregory the seventh, otherwise called Hildebrand. I can shew you who set the Imperiall Crowne upon the head of Henrie the sixt, not with his hand, but with his foot, and with the same foot kicked it off againe, saying, I have power to make Emperours, and unmake them at my plea∣sure: it was Pope Coelestine. I can bring good proofe who it was that would not make peace with Frederick the first, till in the presence of all the peo∣ple, at the doore of St. Markes Church in Venice, the Prince had cast his body flt on the ground, and the Pope setting his foot on his neck, advanced himselfe, blasphemously wresting the Scripture, and applying those words of the Psalmist to himselfe,Psal. 91.13. Thou shalt tread upon the Lion and the Basilisk: it was Pope Adrian, who was afterwards choaked with a flie. I could re∣late unto you in what Councell divine majestie is ascribed to the Pope, and a power above all powers: in the Councell of Lateran, under Leo the tenth. But I tremble at such horrible blasphemies, and leave the Authors and maintainers of them to the censure of the true Melchizedek; who, as he is a Prince of peace, so he is also Rex justitiae, King of righteousnesse, and will one day right himselfe, and all his servants, and destroy the man of sin with the breath of his mouth, and brightnesse of his presence. 7. The next point in which this Text instructeth us, is the strength and validity of an oath. God, when he would shew unto us the immutability of his decree concerning Christs Priesthood, confirmeth it unto him by an
oath, thereby declaring, that the greatest evidence of truth, and strongest assurance of faith between man and man, nay between God and man, is an oath. It is the soveraigne instrument of justice, the indissoluble bond of amity, the safest refuge of innocency, the surest warrant of fidelity, the strongest sinew of all humane society. Detestable therefore and amna∣ble is their doctrine and practice, who straine and weaken the sinew which holdeth the members of all politike bodies together: who cancell that bond, which being made on earth, is registred in the high Court of hea∣ven, and the three persons in the blessed Trinity are witnesses thereunto: who either untye this everlasting knot by cunning equivocation; or cut it asunder by Papall dispensation. O my deare brethren, hold not with them who breake with God, sweare not to their doctrine, who maintaine for∣swearing, take not part with that religion which taketh away all religious obligation. Is that (thinke you) the Orthodoxe faith, which alloweth, and in some case commendethAug. de men∣dac. ad consent. perfidiousnesse and treachery? Is their doctrine truth, Qui dogmatizant mendacium? who doctrinally teach the lawfulnesse of an equivocating lye; an that they may verifie their doctrine of lyes, be∣lye the Truth himself, and endeavour to make that which I tremble to utter, Jesum ipsumSee Parsons sober reckoning with Thomas Morton, and the same L. Bi∣shop of Du∣resme Tract. de aequivocat. Jesuitam, Jesus himselfe in this point a Jesuit? O ubi estis fon∣tes lachrymarum! Of all beasts, we have those in greatest detestation which devoure their owne young. What are our words and promises, our vowes and oathes, but the issue of our owne mouth? which they, who resume and recall, what doe they other than eate and devoure their owne off-spring? The first that brake his allegiance in heaven was the Divell, and thereby became a Divell: and the first that brake promise on the earth was likewise the Divell to Adam and Eve, whose scholars they shew themselves, who teach that the Pope can dispense with the oath of allegiance, that oathes are better broken than kept with Heretickes. Such was Julius the second, who (if we may beleeveBodin. de rep. l. 5. c. 6. Bodin) was not ashamed openly to professe, Fidem dan∣dam omnibus, servandam nemini. Such was Alexander the sixth, who when his son Borgias had drawne in the ring-leaders of the contrary faction by faire promises, and deepest protestations and oathes of pardon and reconci∣liation, and as soon as he had them all in his power, put them to the sword; his father applauded this his perfidious and barbarous act, and cryed out, O factum benè, O well done, and according to my hearts desire. Such wasCocleus hist. Hussit. l. 5. an∣no 1423 Noris te dare fidem haereti∣cis non potu∣isse, & peccare mortliter  servaris. Mar∣tin the fifth, who when Alexander Duke of Licuania had sworne to protect the Hussites, wrote to him in these words, Know that thou couldest not, nor mightest not give faith to Heretickes; and that thou sinnest mortally, if thou keepest thy word and oath with them. Such was Hambertus the Embassadour ofSleia l. 6. Anno 1527. Anno 1577. Charles the fifth, who when the Lady Katherine, the youngest sister of that Emperour, was espoused to John Frederick. Duke of Saxony, & the in∣struments were drawne and sealed, as soone as ever there was a change of Religion in Saxony, he perswaded the young Lady to break off the match, affirming openly, that faith was not to be kept with Heretickes. Such were the Popish Divines of Paris, who both in their Sermons and printed bookes taught openly, that theAug. Thual. hist. l. 63. Aper∣to capitein concionibus & evulgatis scrip∣tis ad fidem sectariis ser∣vandam non obligari prin∣cipem contn∣debant, allato in cam rem Concilii Con∣stantiensis de∣oreto. Prince was not bound to keep faith with Sectaries: and to that purpose alledged a decree of the Councell of Constance. Such was Clemens the seventh, who when Charles the fifth had resolved upon an
expedition against the Moores, to which hee had formerly bound himselfe by oath, sendeth unto him a Bull, whereby hee releaseth him of all oathes that hee had taken for the expulsing those Infidels, notwithstanding any constitution Apostolicall, statute, ordinance, or oath to the contrary; yea, though ratified by the See of Rome with an expresse clause of excluding any dispensation or relaxation whatsoever. Such was Julian the Popes Le∣gate, who perswaded Uladislaus King of Hungarie & Bohemia, to undertake a wicked warre against Amurath the Turke, contrary to oath, assuring him that the Pope allowed of it; and there is no doubt he did so: but (asLoc. ant. cit. Bodin observeth religiously) Pontifex probavit, Deus immortalis non probavit, Almighty God allowed not of it: for Uladislaus the King was slaine in the battell, his whole army put to flight, & Julian the Popes Legate mortally wounded; to whom, as he was now breathing out his last perjured breath, Gregory Sarmosa exprobated his wicked counsell and pestilent doctrine, say∣ing,I nunc, Juli∣ane, & dic egi tuo apud infe∣ros, Haereticis fidem non esse servandam. Goe to, Julian, and tell the King now in the other world (or in hell) that faith is not to be kept with Heretickes and Infidels. You have heard how this Text thundereth against the Fathers of the Ro∣mane Church, & all who embrace or practice their perfidious tenets: mark, I beseech you, now a while how it lighteneth upon the children of our Church, and all who defend the certainty as well of morall as theologicall faith. As when there came aJohn 12.28. voice from heaven, Jesus said, This voice came not because of mee,Ver. 30. but for your sakes; so we may truly say of the oath in my Text, God tooke not it so much because of Christ, to secure him in his of∣fice, as for our sakes, to assure us of the remission of our sinnes, purchased by the bloud which Christ as a Priest offered upon the Crosse▪ How are we assured hereof? what security doth he give us? The greatest that ever was taken or given, the oath of Almighty God. If the bare word of God is a∣ble to sustaine this whole frame of nature, shall not his oath be able to sup∣port a weake Christian in the hottest skirmish with Satan, and most dread∣full conflict with despaire? What though our consciences be so polluted, that we abhorre our selves? yet let us not languish in despaire; for we have a Priest that can cleanse them: there is no staine so fowle, which the bloud of Christ will not fetch out. If we have but so much faith as a graine of mustard seed, we may say withMors Chri∣sti mors meae mortis, quia il∣le mortuus est ut ego vivm: quopacto enim non vivat, pro quo moritur vita? Bernard in his divine rapture: The death of Christ is the death of my death, because he dyed that I might live: for how should he not live, for whom life dyed? O then in a spirituall dereliction, when our heart is as cold as a stone, and we are at the very brinke of despaire, apprehending the full wrath of God against us for all our sinnes, let us not say to the mountaines, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall upon us; but flie to the rocke in Horeb, Christ Jesus, and hide our selves in the holes thereof: Foramina petrae sunt vulnera Christi, The holes of this rocke are the wounds of our Savi∣our: let us by faith run into the holes of this rocke, and feare nothing. Yea, but even there wee heare the cry of our sins like the cry of Sodome; and therefore how can we be safe? Listen wee but a while, and wee shall heare another cry farre lowder, the cry of Christs bloud, which speaketh bet∣ter things for us than the bloud of Abel. Yea, but how may wee be assured that his bloud speaketh for us, and maketh continuall intercession to his Fa∣ther to be reconciled unto us? By his owne promise and his Fathers oath.
If he should neglect to solicite for them, who truly repenting of their sins by faith relye upon him, he should breake his owne word; and neglect the office, to the discharge whereof his Father hath sworne him, saying, Thou art a Priest for ever. How can we ever thinke, that hee will refuse us, who gave us himselfe? Will he spare breath for us, who breathed out his soule for us? Yea, but we sinne continually; and he intercedeth perpetually: he is a Priest for ever. Yea, but we are weake, and our enemies strong, what can a Priest stead us? he may purge our sinnes, but can he save our persons? he may appease the wrath of God, but can he rescue us from the violence of man? he may stand in the gap between God and us, but can he stand in the field for our defence against our enemies? That hee can: for hee is a Priest after the order of Melchizedek, a Kingly Priest; a Priest to instruct us, and a King to protect us: a Priest to reconcile us to God, and a King to subdue our enemies unto us: a Priest to cloth us with his righteousnesse, and a King to arme us with his power: a Priest to consecrate us Priests, and a King to crowne us Kings. To whom King and Priest, and to the Father who or∣dained him, not by imposition of hands, but by deposition of oath, and to the holy Spirit who made the instrument and sealed it, three persons, and one everliving and everloving God, let us as Kings command the ut∣most service of our bodies and soules, and as Priests offer them both intirely for living sacrifices, most agreeable and acceptable to him. Amen.
THE ARKE UNDER THE CURTAINES. A Sermon preached in Oxford at the Act, July 12. Anno 1613. THE XXXVIII. SERMON. 2 SAM. 7.2. The King said unto Nathan the Prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of Ce∣dar, but the Arke of the Lord dwelleth within curtaines. Right Worshipfull, &c. WEe reade of small or no raine that falls at any time on di∣vers parts of Africa; and the cause is supposed to bee the sandy nature of the soyle, from whence the Sun can draw no vapours or exhalations, which ascending from other parts in great abundance, resolve themselves into kinde showres refreshing the earth: This, beloved, is the true reason why God powreth not down his benefits in such plentifull manner as he was wont upon us, because our hearts, like the dry and barren sands of Africa, send up no vapours of divine meditations, mel∣ting into teares, no exhalation or breath of praise or thanksgiving backe to heaven. Undoubtedly, if wee were thankfull to God for his benefits, hee would be alwayes beneficiall to us for our thankfulnesse, and account him∣selfe indebted unto us for such acknowledgement of our debt. For there is nothing that obtaineth more of him, or deserveth better of men, than a thankfull agnition of favours received, and a present commemoration of benefits past. It is the easie taske and imposition which the supreme Lord of all layeth upon all the goods we possesse, & blessings of this life, which we
receive from his bountifull hands; and if we be not behind with him in this tribute of our lips, he will see that all creatures in heaven and earth shall pay their severall tributes unto us: the sun of his heat, the moon of her light, the starres of their influence, the clouds of their moisture, the sea and rivers of their fish, the land of her fruits, the mynes of their treasure, and all things living of their homage and service. But if wee keep backe this duty from him, which the poorest may pay as well as the rich out of the treasuries of their owne heart, no marvell if hee sometimes make fast the windowes of heaven, and locke up the treasures of his bounty, to make us cry to him in our wants and necessities, who would not sing to him in our wealth and pro∣sperity. Upon this or the like consideration good King David, as soone as God had given him rest from all his enemies, thought presently of prepa∣ring a resting place for the Arke. Having therefore a holy purpose to conse∣crate the spoyles he tooke from his enemies, to him that gave him victory over them, and to build a stately and magnificent Temple to the honour of the God of his salvation, and desirous to receive some encouragement from him, to set to so noble a worke, hee calleth for Nathan the Prophet, and breaketh his minde unto him in the words whereof I have made choice for my Text: which containe in them, 1. A godly resolution. 2. A forcible motive. The resolution is implyed, viz. to build God an house; the reason is ex∣pressed, the consideration of his own royall palace. A reason drawn à dissen∣taneis, I dwell in a house of Cedar, but the Arke of the Lord within curtaines. Is this decent or fitting, that the King should bee better housed than his maker and advancer to his royall throne? Yee would expect, that hereupon he should have concluded upon building God an house; but hee proposeth only the major, his owne house; the minor the Arke, and leaveth the Pro∣phet to inferre the conclusion, because in a matter that so neerly concerned the honour and service of God, he would not seem to lead the Prophet, but rather be led by him: from whence we may gather three speciall observa∣tions, not unworthy our most serious thoughts. 1. That in matters immediately appertaining to the service of God and advancement of religion, the Prophets of God are to be called, and their advice to be asked and taken, even by Kings themselves. 2. That it is a noble and princely worke to build Temples or Churches. 3. That we are to set more by the glory of God, than our own ease and safety, and rather to desire the erecting of his house, than the raising our owne fortunes. After we have gathered these, there be other which will fall of themselves from the branches of the Text as wee lightly passe over them. And it came to passe, when the King sate in his house, and the Lord had gi∣ven him rest round about from all his enemies, that the King said unto Nathan, Behold now, &c. The circumstance of time challengeth our due considera∣tion in the first place. It is not usuall for men sitting at ease and at rest to entertaine godly motions, and resolve upon workes of pious bounty: Otium
pulvinar Satanae, rest is oftentimes the Divels cushion; but here it was not so, but rather a chaire of state for God himselfe to rest in. After David had been for a long time pursued by his enemies, and driven from place to place, as it were powred out of vessell into vessell, when he now stood still, he settled not upon his lees with Moab; but breathed out these sweet and hea∣venly meditations and vowes: Behold now I sit at rest, and the Arke of the Lord tosseth and tumbleth from place to place: I lye safely under a sure roofe, able to beare off wind and weather, and the Arke of God hath no better fence than a few curtaines spread over it: the walls of my house are hung with rich arrasse, and the sides of the Arke are covered but with skins; is it fit that it should be so, Nathan? Speak thou on Gods behalfe, who art his Prophet: Is the Kings Cabinet more precious than the Lords Arke? Shall the King have a palace, and God have no house? Shall I pro∣vide a safer place for my records and evidences, than for the records of heaven, and the tables of the testimony, and the inspired Oracles of God? This must not be so, I protest it shall not be so: IPsa. 132.3, 4, 5. sweare unto the Lord, and vow a vow unto the mighty God of Jacob, that I will not henceforth enter into the tabernacle of my house, nor come upon my bed: I will not suffer my eyes to sleep, nor my eye-lids to slumber, until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. Such holy vowes and religious oathes and protestations many of Gods children make in the depth of their misery; but few (as here David doth) in the height of their prosperity, and the midst of their triumphs. The zeale of most men lieth in their heart like fire in a flint, it must be strucke out with some violence; their prayers and fervent meditations like hot spices are then most fragrant, when their hearts are bruised in Gods mortar, and broken with afflictions and troubles. Some such thing befalleth the soule in prosperity, as the husbandmen observe in a fat soyle and plentifull yeere: LuxuriantOvid. l. 1. de art. animi rebus plerunque secundis. Prosperity breedeth a ranknesse in the desires and a dangerous riot of sinne: whereof Moses maketh great complaint in his song; ButDeut. 32.15. Jesurun waxed fat and kicked (thou art waxed fat, thou art growne thicke, thou art covered with fatnesse) then he forsooke God that made him, and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation: and God by the ProphetHos. 13.6. Hosea, According to their pa∣stures so were they filled: they were filled, and their heart was exalted; there∣fore have they forgotten mee. O how great is our ingratitude? when God most remembreth us, we most forget him, drinking our fill of the rivers of his pleasures, and never thinking of the spring; devouring greedily the good blessings of God, as Swine doe acornes upon the ground, never looking up to the tree from whence they fall. David was farre from this brutish vice; for as soone as God had destroyed his enemies round about him, he thought of building a magnificent Temple. When other Kings after so good suc∣cesse and glorious victories obtained in war would have cast away all care or thought of Religion, at least for the present, to give the more scope to their licentious desires and lusts; David confineth himselfe to his closet, there recounteth the innumerable benefits God had heaped upon him, and
studieth how to expresse his gratefulnesse to him: in fine, he resolveth with himselfe to build a stately palace for the King of heaven, and sendeth for the Prophet Nathan to advise with him about it. The King said to Nathan the Prophet. David a Prophet himselfe con∣ferreth with the Prophet Nathan. Saint Peter a prime Apostle is repro∣ved by the Apostle Saint Paul. John the elder is instructed by an Elder. Whence we learn, That Prophets need Prophets advice, Apostles need Apo∣stles admonitions, Elders need Elders instructions. As two tooles whet one the other, and two Diamonds point each the other, and two Torches mutually light one the other; so it pleaseth the wisedome of God to divide the gifts of his Spirit severally among the Pastours of the Church in diffe∣rent kindes and degrees, that they might be one bettered by the other. In which consideration, among many others not lesse important, the Founders and Benefactors of Collegiate Churches and Universities have built so many houses for Prophets and Prophets children as you see, to live together, and by lectures, conferences and disputations, to whet and sharpen one the other. And if one starre, one eminent Doctor in the Church give so great a light in the darke of ignorance, what a lustre, what an ornament must a Col∣ledge of such Doctors, an University of such Colledges, as it were a con∣junction of many starres, or rather a heaven of many such conjunctions and constellations uniting their light be? If one aromaticall tree send forth such a savour of life, as we smell in every particular congregation, what shall we judge of a grove of such trees? surely it can be no other than the Paradise of God upon earth. But because David is not here stiled the Prophet, but the King (The King said to Nathan the Prophet,) I rather gather from these words the great honour which Nathan the Prophet received from David the King, than the direction or advice that David the King received from Nathan the Prophet. The King said. Though Kings areBils suprem. p. 1. supreme Commanders for the truth, yet they are not the supreme or sole directers unto truth: for in scruples of conscience and perplexed controversies of Religion, they are to require the law from the mouth of the Priest, to aske counsell of the Prophets, and generally in all matters appertaining to God to heare the Ministers of God declaring to them the will of God out of his Word: Symmachus was bold to tell Anastasius the Emperour, that as Bishops owe subjection to Gods Sword in Princes hands, so Princes owe obedience to Gods Word in Bi∣shops mouthes;Causab. de lib. eccles. Defer Deo in nobis, nos deferemus Deo in te, O Emperour, heare God speaking by us, and wee will feare God ruling by thee. The same God, who hath put a materiall sword in thy hands, to smite malefactors in their body, hath put a spirituall sword in our mouth, to slay sinne in the soule. The Magistrate is the hand of God, but the Preacher is his mouth. And for this cause all wise and religious Kings have given them their eares, and taken some of them into their bosome, as David doth here Nathan, to receive instruction and direction from them how to sway the royall scepter within the walls of the Church. Let it not seeme burthensome unto you, my dearest brethren, upon so just occasion as is offered mee in my Text, to speake somewhat of the ho∣nour of that calling which calleth you all to God. From whose mouth doe
ye heare the glad tidings of salvation? From whose hands doe ye receive the seales of grace? Who have the oversight and charge of your soules? Who are the meanes under God to reconcile God unto you by their pray∣ers, and bring you unto God by their powerfull ministerie, but your faith∣full and painfull Pastours, who in performing these holy duties of their cal∣ling, are termedProsp. de vit. contem. l. 1. c 25. Hisunt Ministri verbi, Adjuto∣res Dei, Ora∣cula Sp. S. coadjutores Dei, as it were fellow-labourers with God? Per istos Deus placatur populo, per istos populus instruitur Deo. All other lawfull callings are from God, but this was the calling of God himselfe: other offices he appointed, this he executed: others he commends, this he discharged. When he tooke our flesh upon him, and lived upon earth, he would not be made a King, nor sit as a Judge upon a Nisi prius of inheri∣tance; yet performed he the office of a Preacher through his whole life, and of a Priest at his death; offering himselfe by the eternall Spirit upon the high Altar of the Crosse, where he was bothConfes. l. 10. c. 42. Pro no∣bis tibi Victor & Victima, & ideo Victor quia Victima: pro nobis tibi Sacerdos & Sa∣crificium, & i∣deò Sacerdos quia Sacrifici∣um; faciens ti∣bi nos de ser∣vis filios. Victor and Victima, & ideo Victor quia Victima, as St. Austine playeth sweetly in a rhetoricall key. May the civill Magistrates glorie in this, that God calleth them gods? and may not they that serve at Christs Altar take as great comfort, in that God himselfe calleth his Sonne a Priest, saying,Psal. 110.4. Thou art a Priest for ever? Wherefore, if the glorious titles wherewith God himselfe graceth the Mi∣nisterie, of Stewards of his house, Dispencers of his mysteries, Lights of the world, Angels of the Church: if the noble presidents in Scripture of Mel∣chizedek King and Priest, David King and Prophet, Solomon King and Preacher, suffice not to redeeme the sacred order from the scandall of pro∣fane men, and contempt of the world; yet, methinkes, sith the Son of God, and King of glorie hath taken upon him the office, and executed the functi∣on of a Priest, all men should entertaine a reverend opinion of the Priest∣hood of the Gospel, and not to use the word Priest as a reproach to man, which was one of the three dignities of God himselfe, much lesse seeke to dis∣grace their persons, who are Gods Instruments to conveigh grace into their soules. What shall I say more? Nay, what can I say lesse? He that ho∣noureth not the name of Christ, which signifiethLuke 4.18. Annointed to preach the Gospel, is no Christian: he that conceiveth basely, or speaketh contumeli∣ously of the sacred order of Priests, is worse than an Infidell. For the heathenCa sar. Com. de bello Gal. French and English, in Julius Caesars time, placed their Priests, which they called Druides, above their Gentrie, yea, and most of the Nobi∣litie; appointing the chiefe of them to beare on his breast the Image of Truth, engraven in a rich Jewell. TheBodin. de repub. l. 3. c. 8. Turkes, Moores, and Arabians, have their Priests, which they call Mophtae, in highest estimation, and de∣volve the most important matters of State, and doubts of their law, to their definitive sentence and order. The Syrians adorne their Priests with aPhilost. de vit. Apo. T n. 2. Crowne of gold: the Brachmans with a Scepter of gold, and Mitre beset with precious stones. The Romans stiled their chiefe Flamen, Regem sa∣crorum; adoring that name in their Priests which they abhorred in their Princes and Consuls. Lastly, the Egyptians, Athenians,Strab. geog. l. 7.

Lacedaemonians, and almost all the Heathen, who either had Kingly Priests, or sacrificing
Kings, shall condemne such Christians at the day of Christ: then they shall see of that calling which seemed so vile, darke, and obscure in their eyes, some glistering as Pearles in the gates, others sparkling as Diamonds in the foundation, and no small number shining as Starres in the arch of the hea∣venly Jerusalem, and amidst them the Sunne of righteousnesse Christ Jesus, exercising his royall Priesthood, and making intercession to his Father for all those, and those onely, who honour his Priestly function here upon earth in his Ministers, by maintaining and countenancing them; and in themselves, by sacrificing their dearest affections to him. But I list not to dwell on this argument, but rather with the Kingly Pro∣phet in his house of Cedars. I dwell in an house of Cedars. In these words David findeth not fault with the beautifull roofe of his Princely Palace, but the meane and vile covering of the Arke: it troubled him not that he was so well provi∣ded for, but that the Arke was so ill. Princes may dwell in houses of Ce∣dars, stately built, and richly furnished with all the rarities which nature or art affoords. Why were Jewels, and precious Stones, and rich metals cre∣ated, but for mans use? And what better use can be made of them, than to shew forth the glorie of God, and the splendour and magnificence of his Vicegerents on earth? Certainely they were never made to maintaine the luxurie of private men, which is now growne to that excesse, especially at Court, that the Embassadours of forreine Princes speake as loud of it a∣broad, as the poore cry and wring for it at home. Where shall we finde a Paula, deserving the commendation which St.In Epitaph. Paul. Non in marmora, sed lapides vivos. Jerome giveth her for lay∣ing out her money, not upon marble or free-stone, but upon those living stones which she knew one day should be turned into gemmes, and laid in the founda∣tion of the heavenly Jerusalem? Doth not the liberality of most of the weal∣thy of this age resemble their heart, which is hard, cold, and stony? The greatest expence they are at is in building houses of Cedar for themselves, by which they are better knowne, than their houses by them. As the world, so the Proverb is turned upside downe: it stood thus, Non domus Domi∣num, sed Dominus domum: but now it is thus overturned, Non Dominus domum, sed domus Dominum: the house gets no credit by the owner, but the owner, if he have any, by the house. Ye will thinke, when ye come into many of them, that ye are fallen into an Egyptian Temple, most glorious without, but within nothing to be seen but the picture of a Jack an Ape, or a Cat, or some such contemptible creature as that superstitious Nation wor∣shipped. I sharpen my stile the more against this abuse of our age, because it is well knowne that the superfluous expence upon the Sepulchres of the dead, and the erecting of houses of Cedars for the living, farre above, I will not say the wealth, but above the ranke and worth of those that dwell in them, is the cause why the Arke of the Lord lieth yet in many places under the curtaines; nay, not so well, but under the open aire, without cover or roofe to keepe out raine and weather. If that which hath beene luxuriously cast away in building houses of pleasure, and ambitiously, if not superstiti∣ously, consumed in erecting Statues, Obelisques, Tombes, or Monuments for the dead, had beene employed in rearing up houses for Prophets, and erecting Temples to the living God, the Prophets of God should not need
to complaine, as now they are constrained, against the men of this age, in the words of the Prophet Haggai, c. 1. ver. 4. Yee dwell in sieled houses, and the house of the Lord lieth waste: or in the like in my text, Behold, now ye dwell in houses of Cedars, and The Arke of the Lord within the Curtaines. Before the Sunne rise you see no light, but through mists, and vapours, and shadowes on the earth: even so before the Sunne of righteousnesse Christ Jesus arose in the Firma∣ment of his Church, there was no light of the Gospell to be seene, but through mists and obscure shadowes; so theHeb. 8.5. & 10.1. Apostle termeth the types and figures of the old Law: among which the Tabernacle, and in it the Arke, and therein especially the Tables, Rod, and Pots of Manna, shadowed the state of the Christian Church, and presented to the eye of faith the princi∣pall meanes of salvation under the Gospell, which are three: 1 The preaching of the Word, summarily contained in the two Ta∣bles. 2 The Sacrament of Christs body and bloud, figured by the Manna. 3 The exercise of Ecclesiasticall discipline, lively set forth by the bud∣ding of Aarons rod. As for Baptisme, which is the Sacrament of entrance into the Church, the type thereof was set at the entrie into the Tabernacle, where stood a great Laver, in which those that came to worship God, after they had put off their clothes, bathed themselves, as we Christians put off the old man, and wash away the corruption of originall sinne in the Font of Baptisme, before we are admitted as members into the Christian Church; whereunto three sorts of men belong: 1 Some that are to be called. 2 Others that are already called into it. 3 Such as are called out of it into Heaven. 1 The first are in the state of nature. 2 The second in the state of grace. 3 The third in the state of glorie. Answerable whereunto God commandeth three spaces or partitions to be made: 1 Atrium, the outward Court, for the people. 2 Sanctum, the holy place, for the ordinarie Priests. 3 Sanctum sanctorum, the most holy place, for the High-Priest to enter once a yeere, and shew himselfe to God for the people. Which are similitudes of true things. For as by the outward Court the Priest went into the holy place, and from the holy place into the most holy; so from the state of nature the children of God are brought into the state of grace, and from the state of grace into the state of glorie. If any que∣stion these mysticall expositions, for the first I referre them to St.Apoc. 11.2. John, who saith expressely, that the Court was given to the Gentiles, and was not
therefore to be mete with a golden reed: for the second, to St.1 Pet. 2.9. Peter, who calleth all Christians Priests, for whom the holy place was appointed: for the third to St.Heb. 9.24. Paul, who openeth the vaile of that figure, and sheweth how Christ our High-Priest, after his death, entered into the holy of holies, and there appeared before God for us. To these observations of the Ta∣bernacle may be added many the like resemblances betweene the Arke and the Church. In the fore-front of the Tabernacle there was the Altar of burnt-offerings, and a place of refuge for malefactors, who, if they could take hold of the hornes of the Altar, were safe. Christs Crosse is this Al∣tar, the hornes whereof whosoever take hold by faith, be they never so great malefactors, escape Gods vengeance. In the Sanctuarie was the mer∣cy seat, towards which the Cherubims faces looked, to teach us, that the An∣gels of1 Pet. 1.12. heaven desire to looke into the mysteries of the Gospell. The di∣mensions of the Arke were small, and the limits of the militant Church in comparison of the malignant are narrow. The outside of the Arke was co∣vered with skins, but the inside was overlaid with gold: in like manner, the Church hath for the most part no great outward appearance, pompe, or splendour; but yet is alwayes mostPsal. 45 13. glorious within. The arke when it was taken by the Philistims conquered Dagon, and cast him downe on his face: even so the Church of Christ, when shee is in captivitie and grea∣test weakenesse in the eye of the world, getteth the better of her ene∣mies; and is so farre from being diminished by persecution, that she is rather encreased by it. For the ashes of Martyrs in this exceed the ashes of the Phoenix; out of her ashes riseth but one Phoenix, but out of the ashes of one Martyr many hundreds. The Arke at the first was carried on the shoul∣ders of the Levites, but in later times was put in a2 Sam. 6.6. Cart, and drawne by beasts, who shooke it, and were like quite to have overturned it. I need not make the Antapodosis, ye shall find it in the Writers of the Ecclesiasticall storie: at the first the Church was governed for neere sixe hundred yeeres by worthy Prelates and Pastours; but afterwards, especially in some parts, by such as deserved rather the name of beasts than men, and some of them of monsters than beasts. The arke removed still from place to place,See Spec. Pon∣tif. Plat. omh. & Mgaeburg till Solomon brought it with joy and triumph into the Temple which he had built for it: even so the militant Church is tumbled and tossed from one countrey to another, and shall finde no resting place till the true Solo∣mon Christ Jesus carry her in triumph into the Temple which hee hath built for her in heaven; meane while she still remaineth under the Cur∣taines. Under the Curtaines. The Curtaines under which the Arke remained (saith an ancient Father) prefigured the Bishops and Governours of the Church, who are set in high and eminent places above their brethren, as the Cur∣taines made of Camels haire and badgers skins were spread over the Arke to cover it, and save the precious stuffe within it from wet and soyling. Which interpretation if we allow, certainely they who live in Colledges and private Cures, under the governement of Bishops and Prelates, have no cause to envie at their eminent dignity, but all reason to pray for their safety. For if any storme of persecution arise and beat upon the Church, the cur¦taines that are uppermost must beare it off: and while they hold out, the
inferiour Clergy, who resemble the inward linings of blew silke, are safe. There are many fruits that are set in sunny places to ripen them, but as good are scorched and dryed up with the heat of the Sunne beames, which would have thrived in the shade. As the corall branch is fresh and greene under the water, but as soone as it appeareth above it turneth red, ac∣cording to the motto of the Poets embleme: —nunc rubeo, ante virebam. so have wee seen many that prospered under the government of others, and flourished as it were in the shade, who after they came into the Sun, that is, into the eye of the world, being advanced to great dignities and preferments, have turned red with the corall, blushed with shame enough, having too narrow mindes for such ample dignities and e∣states. Thus I might enlarge and spread my meditations to the full length of the curtaines in my Text; but because I see the time will out-strip mee, if I make not the more haste, and because I see many composing themselves to their rest, and some fast already, I will begin to draw the curtaines, and shut up all that hath beene delivered with a briefe application to our selves. Behold now I dwell in an house of Cedars, and the Arke of the Lord within the curtaines. If ever God affected any King above others, David was he, a man after Gods owne heart. If ever David affected any worke above o∣thers, it was the building of Gods House, which he solemnlyPsal. 132.2. vowed, and largely contributed of his1 Chron. 29. owne to it, as we may reade in the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. Yet David, who dedicated himselfe wholly to God, was not permitted to dedicate a Temple unto him. David, whose heart so boyled with the zeale of Gods house, that it consumed away in sighes and teares, and these and the like meditations and exclamations: Whom have I in heaven, but thee, O Lord? and, O how amiable are thy dwellings, thou Lord of hosts? My soule is athirst for God, even for the living God. When shall I come and appeare in the presence of God? David, whose ambition was to be a doore keeper in the house of God, and his greatest envie against the birds that built upon Gods Altars, where he desired to repose his soule, yet could not obtaine the honour to begin, much lesse to finish the holy worke of building the Temple. What may wee conceive to bee the reason hereof? God forbad him. Why did God forbid so good a King to undertake so good a worke? God himselfe yeeldeth a reason, Because his hand had shed much bloud. Yet it may be truly alledged in Davids defence, that his warres were just, and that it was his infelicity, not his fault, that his sword had bin so often drawne against his enemies. Howsoever, because hee had embrued his hands in bloud, God would not suffer him to lay a stone in the foundati∣on of the Temple, to teach us, that the foundation of the Church is not to be laid in bloud. Speares and Swords are not fit to build withall, Phyfes and Drummes are no proper instruments to sound out the Gospel of peace. Religion is such a professed friend to peace, and a sworne enemy to bloudy warres, that shee suffereth not willingly a sword to be drawne in her owne
defence: How then doth she make her part good against her mortal enemies & cruell persecuters? not by the Sword, but by the Word; not byLactan. divin. instit. l. 5. c. 20. Non occiden∣do, sed mori∣endo, non sae∣vitiâ, sed pati∣entià, non sce∣lere, sed fide; nam si sangui∣ne, si tormen∣tis, si malo re∣ligionem de∣fendere velis, non defende∣tur illa, sed polluetur, violence, but by patience; not by resisting, but by submitting; not by killing, but by dying. The best armour of a Christian is his proofe of patience, and his only lawfull weapons against his lawfull Soveraign are prayers & teares, where∣with S. Ambrose fought against the Arrian Emperor: Rogamus, Auguste, non pugnamus, we fall down before thee, O Emperor, we rise not up against thee; we beset thee with petitions, not with armes. And when the Emperor com∣manded him peremptorily to give up a Church to the Arrians, hee useth no other violence in withstanding the command of the Hereticall Prince, than of passionate affection; no troupes, but tropes: I can sorrow, saith he, I can sigh, I can weep, these are my weapons, by other means I neither may nor can make resistance: If you seeke for my goods, take them: if you desire my life, I lay it at your feet, I will not stand upon my guard, I will not flye to Sanctuary to save my life, I will most gladly be sacrified for the Altars of my God, if it so please you, upon them. This was the ancient carriage of Christian subjects towards their Soveraigne, though infected with heresie, & enraged against the true professours, not to take armes against them, but to lift up their hands to heaven for them; not to contest, but to obtest; not to attempt any thing a∣gainst them, but cedendo vincere, to conquer them by yeelding. But the Ge∣nerall of the Romane military forces hath quite altered the ancient disci∣pline, by turning prayers into threats, supplications into excommunicati∣ons, cries into alarums, teares into bullets, and words into swords: and which is to be bewailed with bloudy teares, the Garland of red Roses (as Saint Cyprian sweetly termeth the Crowne of Martyrdome) is put upon their heads, not who dye for the faith, but who kill; not who shed their owne bloud, but who draw the bloud not of Infidels, but of Christians; not of private persons, but publike; not of subjects, but of Soveraignes. The de∣testable oration of Pius made in the Conclave upon the news of the murder of the French King, and the damnable Legend of Jaques Clement should not have moved me to have laid so fowle an aspersion upon any Romish Priests or Jesuites, if I had not seen with my eyes at Paris the names of Old corne & Garnet executed for the Powder Treason, inserted into their Catalogue of Martyrs; and heard also of certaine English Priests sharply censured for offering to pray for their soules, because thereby they made scruple of their crowne of Martyrdome, which (according to their doctrine) dischargeth all that are called unto it from Purgatory flames, and giveth them present entrance into heaven. O blessed Jesu, are these of thy company? didst thou make such a profession before Pontius Pilate? didst thou teach thy Disciples to save mens soules by murdering their bodies, to plant Religi∣on, and found thy Church by blowing up Parliaments? are these of thy spirit that call not downe fire from heaven, but rather call it up from hell, to consume a whole Kingdome with a blaze, and offer it up as a Holo∣caust to the Molock at Rome? NoBosquier. in Evang. Domin. fish will be caught in a bloudy net: if they see but a drop spilt upon it, they will swimme another way. Therefore let all the fishers of men, that cast the net of the Gospel into the sea of the world to take up soules, looke henceforward that they bloud not their net with cruell persecutions and slaughter of Gods servants. In the building
of the materiall Temple there was heard no noise of any iron toole, to shew, that in stirres and broyles there is no building of Gods house. As King-fishers breed in a calme sea, so the Church exceedingly multiplyeth in the dayes of peace, which long may we enjoy under our Solomon, who deserveth as well the title of Preserver of the Peace, as Defender of the Faith of the Church. For what doth he not, to take up quarrels, and com∣pose differences in all reformed Churches? wherein God hath so blessed his zealous endeavours, that as he hath hindred the growth of much cockle sowne by Vorstius and Bertius in the Low-countries, so hee hath cleane cut off two heads of controversies lately arising one in the place of the other in France, the former concerning the imputation of Christs active obedi∣ence; the latter concerning his immunity from the Law. As for his love to his Nathans, and infinite desire of repairing the Temple, I cannot speake more than you all conceive. What then is the cause that so good a worke goeth on so slowly? How commeth it to passe, that in so many places of this Land the Spouse of Christ lieth sick of a consumption, crying pitifully, Stay me with flagons, and comfort me with apples: for I faint, I swoune, I dye? Whose fault is it, that many hundreds of soules, for whom Christ shed his precious bloud, are like to famish & perish for the want of the bread of life, and there is none to breake it unto them? It seemeth strange to mee, that in France and other countries, where the poore flocke of Christ Jesus is mise∣rably fleeced and fleaed by the Romish Clergy, yet they finde meanes to maintaine a Preacher in every congregation, and that in divers places of this Kingdome, where neither the wild Bore of the forrest digges at the roote of ou Vine, nor the wild Beast of the field browseth upon the branches thereof, there should not be sufficient allowance no not for an insufficient Curate. Elie's zeale was none of the hottest, yet he made no reckoning of his private losse in comparison of the publike: when he heard the messenger relate the flght of Israel, and the death of his two sonnes, Hophni and Phi∣neas, he was mentis compos, and fate quietly in his chaire: but as soone as mention was made of the taking of the Arke, hee presently fell downe back∣ward, and gave up the Ghost. Deare Christians, many living Temples of the Holy Ghost have bin lately surprised by Papists, & yet no man taketh it to heart. The Jewes, as Josephus reporteth in the siege of Jerusalem, though they were constrained themselves to eate Mice, Rats, and worse Vermine, yet alwaies brought faire and fat beasts to the Temple for sacrifices. And Livie testifieth, that when the Tribunes complained of want of gold in the treasury to offer to Apollo, the Mations of Rome plucked off their chaines, bracelets, and rings, and freely offered them to the Priests, to supply that defect in the service of their gods. I pray God these Painims and Infidels be not brought in at the day of Judgement to condemne many of our great professours, who care not how the Temple falls to decay, so their houses stand; have no regard how God is served, so they bee well attended; take no thought though the Arke be under the curtaines, so they be under a rich canopy, or at least a sure roofe: who are so farre from offering to God things before abused to pride and luxury, that they abuse to pride and luxu∣ry things by their religious ancestors offered unto God: who with Zeba and Zalmunna having taken the houses of God into their possession, lay out the
price of bloud, the price of soules upon riotous feasting, gorgeous apparrell, vaine shewes, Hawkes, Hounds, and worse. What sinne may be compared to this, that turneth those things to maintaine sinne, that should convert many unto righteousnesse? How is it possible that they should escape Gods venge∣ance, who nourish pride with sacriledge, maintaine luxury with murder, not of bodies, but of soules, whom they and their heires starve, by keeping back the Ministers maintenance, who should feed them with the bread of life? What boldnesse is it? nay, what presumption? what contempt of divine majesty? what abominable profanenesse and impiety to breake open the doores of the Tabernacle, and rifle the Arke of the Covenant, and rob God himselfe? No marvell therefore if hee have shewed extraordinary judge∣ments upon such felons, as he did upon Achan, who payed deare for his Ba∣bylonish raiment: for it cost him all his goods, and hisJudg. 7.25. And all Israel stoned him with stones, & burned him with fire after they had stoned him with stones. life too, and the life of his sonnes and daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had. As he did upon Belshazzar, who as hee held the plate of the Temple in his hand, quaffing andDan. 5.5, 25. carowsing, saw a hand∣writing on the wall before him; Mene, Tekel, Upharsin: Mene, God hath num∣bred thy Kingdome, and finished it: Tekel, Thou art weighed in the ballance, and art found wanting: Peres, Thy Kingdome is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. As he did uponAct. 5.3, 5, 10. Ananias and Sapphira, who were strucke with sudden death for saving but part of that for themselves, which they had before consecrated to God. As he did upon Pyrrhus his souldiers,Lact. l. 2. di∣vin. instit. c. 8. Praefectus An∣tonu Turul∣lus, cum apud Coas everso Aesculapit lu∣co classem fe∣cisset, eodem loco à militi∣bus Caesaris interemptus est. who after they had robbed the Temple of Proserpina, and sailed away joy∣fully with the rich prize, were driven backe againe with a violent tempest, and suffered shipwracke at the shore in sight of the Temple which they spoyled: The Mariners were all cast away, and nothing was saved but the gold and silver which they stole out of the Temple. As hee did upon He∣rods servants, who entring into the Temple of Jerusalem, and opening the sepulchre of David, to filch away the great masse of treasure that was laid up there, were all burnt with a fire that suddenly brake out of the chest or coffin in which the Kings bones were enclosed. As he did uponD. Andrewes conc. ad Cler. Laqueos mon∣stro vel in ipsâ gentium histo∣riâ Cambysen, qui sacrum Hamonis sibi exitio fuisse sentit Bren∣num, qui Del∣phicum, Cras∣sum, qui Hie∣rosolomita∣num, &c. Leo Copro∣nimus, who entering into a Church endowed by Constantine the great with a precious crowne of gold beset with Carbuncles, had no sooner taken the crowne out of the place, and put it upon his sacrilegious head, but there a∣rose a Carbuncle in his temples, of which hee dyed, as the Historians of that age report; verifying the Proverbe of Syracides, Quo quis peccat, eo punietur: a Carbuncle was his sinne, and a Carbuncle was his end: Capus sa∣crilegio pollutum Carbunculo aduritur. To make towards the shore, and leaving this salt discourse, to give you a taste of sweet water in the haven. As I have made it good unto you by many arguments and instances, that nothing is worse taken than by sacriledge from God, so nothing is better given than by pious bounty unto God. O∣bed-Edom found it in his house, the widow of Sarepta in her cruce, the Sa∣maritane in her childe, David in his race, and Mary Magdalen in her soule. And here that observation ofNat. hist. l. 1. Multa in pre∣tio habita sunt, tantummodo quod templis dicata. Pliny taketh place; Many things have been highly esteemed onely for this reason, because they have been dedicated to Gods service. The giving of any thing to God addeth worth to the gift. We of∣fer things to great personages, because they are rare and precious; on the
contrary, things are precious and sacred, because they are given to God: not onely the giver, but the gift also gaineth by being given unto God. The cruce that ministred nourishment to the Prophet, became an everlasting spring of oyle: the water that cleansed the sacrifices after the Angel trou∣bled it, received a medicinall vertue to cure all diseases: the Manna that was kept in a golden pot in the Arke never corrupted: the boxe of oynt∣ment which Mary brake upon our Saviours head, yeeldeth yet a fragrant smell in the Church.Plin. nat. hist l. 12. c. 14. Cum Leonidas di∣ceret Alexan∣dro isto modo cùm deviceris thuriferas gen∣tes supplicato, ille Arabiâ po∣titus thure o∣nustam navem misit ei, ex hor∣tatus ut largè deos adoraret. Alexander the Great, by burning frankincense frankly and liberally in the service of God, gained by conquest the King∣dome of Arabia, where all sweet trees grow. Davids vow of building God an house, and desire to performe it, though he accomplished not his desire, yet so endeared him to God, that he and his sons after him to many genera∣tions fared the better for it. How much more shall the performance of so noble a worke obtaine of God the performance of his gracious promise, to build their houses, and establish their private estates, who out of love of his ordinance, and zeale of his worship contribute liberally to the maintenance of his service, and beautifying of his Sanctuary? Who would not willingly fill his hand to God, who filleth all things living with plenteousnesse? Who would not willingly by pious bounty bind the Lord of the whole world in an obligation to him, who is so good a pay-master, that hee will make al∣lowance for a cup of coldMat. 10.42. water given to a Prophet, and keep a register of two mites that are cast into his treasury? Howbeit I must enforme you from the Apostle, that God dwelleth not inActs 17.24. Temples made with hands, but in the hearts and mindes of the faithfull, who (as living stones) being built upon the corner-stone Christ Jesus by faith, and coupled fast together by unity and Christian charity, rise up by elevated desires and affections to a holy and spirituall temple of the living God; and this spirituall and inward temple farre surpasseth in the beauty of holinesse the outward or materiall. For that is holy only by denomination and relation, this by inhesion and infusion of the graces of sanctification: that is adorned with lights and tapers, this with the Word of God: that with rich vestments and ornaments, this with heavenly habits and divine vertues: that when it is once built needs only to be repaired, and when it is suffici∣ently repaired, needs no more cost or labour to bee bestowed upon it for a good space; this needeth continually to be built, repaired, enlarged and a∣dorned: for to build it in the ignorant, to repaire it in the relapsed, to enlarge it in the proficient, and beautifie and adorne it in those that are perfect, is the end of our mission, and tenour of our commission, and in a word, the whole duty of the man of God. Wherefore, I beseech you (beloved brethren) suf∣fer your selves to be hewne and fitted for this building, and set in order by the line of Gods Word. Now, that stones orderly set may make a sure buil∣ding, three things are requisite: 1. Ut inhaereant fundamento. 2. Cohaereant inter se. 3. Adhaereant tecto. First, that they be built upon a firme foundation. Secondly, that they sticke and hold fast together. Thirdly, that they joyne unto, and bear up the roofe.
First, you must be built and lye upon a sure foundation: no other sure1 Cor. 3.11. foundation can be laid, than that which is already laid, even Christ Jesus; cleave fast to him, relye only upon him, build upon his Gospel for your in∣struction, his grace for your conversion, his bloud for your redemption, his prayer for your intercession. Secondly, Cohaerete invicem, sticke fast together, bee firmly united in Christian charity, keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Unities severed or divided make no number, letters divided make no syllable, syl∣lables divided make no word, words divided make no speech, members di∣vided make no body, stones divided make no wall. The Ark of the Church is like the ship in controversie of law, in which two owners claimed right, of which it was said,Eras. Adag. Si dividas, perdis, if you cut it in two parts to satisfie both parties, you destroy the whole. Thirdly, Adhaerete tecto, be pinned fast unto, and support the roofe. What is the roofe, but the higherRom. 13.1. powers ordained of God? As the roofe must beare off stormes from the walls, so the walls must beare up the roofe; if the roofe decay, the walls will soone feele it. The Athenians in their greatest dangers were wontEras. chil. , to cast out the great ancher, which they called the holy ancher: the chiefest Pilots and Steresmen in our State discover so great dangers, that they command the holy ancher to be cast out; and if this ancher fasten not on your golden sands, the great vessell, in whose bottome lyeth not only the safety of the Prince, the honour of the King∣dome, but the state of sincere Religion throughout the Christian world, is in perill of drowning; and if the great vessell miscarry, what will become of the skiphs of every ones private estate? Yee have heard (beloved Christians) of the materiall Temple to be ere∣cted and kept in repaire by you that are wealthy; and the spirituall to bee built, repaired, and adorned in you all: yee have learned how yee (as living stones) are to be drawne to this building, fitted for it, and placed in it; yet when we have done what we can to build you in your most holy faith, and yee have helped & furthered the work what yee are able, except thePsal. 127.1. Lord build the house, their labour is but in vain that go about to build it. Wherefore let us addresse our praiers to God the Master-builder, and to Jesus Christ the foundation and chiefe corner-stone, to build us upon himselfe by faith, and fit us for this building by obedience, and couple and joyne us fast by charity, that we may continue as solid and firme stones here in the earthly, and shine hereafter as precious stones in the heavenly Jerusalem.

JOHAN. 21.15, 16, 17. 15. Quum ergo prandissent, dicit Simoni Petro Jesus, Simon fili Jonae, di∣ligis me plùs quàm hi? Dicit ei, Certè, Domine, tunosti quòd amem te. Dicit ei, Pasce agnos meos. 16. Dicit ei rursum secundò, Simon fili Jonae, diligis me? Ait illi, Certè, Domine, tu nosti quòd amem te. Dicit ei, Pasce oves meas. 17. Dicit ei tertiò, Simon fili Jonae, amas me? Tristitiâ fuit affectus Pe∣trus, quòd tertiò dixisset ipsi, Amas me? Dixit{que} ei, Domine, tu omnia nosti, tu nosti quòd amem te. Dicit ei Jesus, Pasce oves meas. QUod de tribus in coelo testibus Johannes, idem de tribus hisce versibus liceat usurpare,1 Johan. 5.7. Hi tres unum sunt. Ete∣nim sacro huic contextuitrina intexitur interrogatio, quae tamen unica est, Amas me? & trinae interrogationi tri∣plex redditur responsum, quod tamen unicum est, tu no∣sti quòd amem te: & triplici responso triplex additur man∣datum, quod tamen unicum est, Pasce oves meas. Ter repetita interrogatio, summam examinandi diligentiam; ter accommodata Petri responsio, sum∣mum amandi desiderium; ter inculcatum Petro mandatum, summam pas∣cendi necessitatem indicat, & Pastorum omnium mentibus intimis infigit. Enim verò,Nat. hist. l. 22 de med. herb. c. 21. Magi He∣liotropium in Tertians ter alligari jubent ab ipso aegro. quemadmodum Heliotropium non nisi ter alligatum corpori ter∣tianae febri mederi, ex Magorum doctrinâ refert Plinius; ita planè Augusti∣nus, Cyrillus, & interpretum recentiorum facile princeps Calvinus, conjiciunt gravissimam illam plagam, quam sibi Petrus, & dignitati Apostolicae trinâ negatione inflixerat, non alia potuisse, quàm trinae confessionis medicinâ sa∣nari. Hinc est quòd Petrus tertianae suae quâ in domo Pontificis cohor∣ruerat, quasi ter heliotropium applicans, ter ad solem justitiae se convertit; & quoties negavit se Dominum scire, toties affirmat Dominum scire, quòd ipse eum ex intimis animi sensibus & medullis amet. Ita nimirum loci hu∣jus rationem subducitTract. in Jo∣han. 123. Augustinus, Redditur trinae negationi trina confessio, ne minus amori lingua serviat quàm timori. Quam ut ab eo confessionem Christus eliceret, & pristinae eum dignitati restitueret, ter animum fodit amoris aculeo, amas me? iterùm, amas me? etiam tertiò, amas me? Amas me propter te? amas me propter me? amas me supra te? Prorsus ut ma∣ritus sponsam suam quam toto orbe chariorem habet, derelicturus solet af∣fari, amas me? curam suscipe parvulorum meorum: ita Christus Petrum blandè compellat, Simon Jonae, amas me? pasce agnos meos, & ter ut dixi eandem tundit incudem, ut copiosas amoris stricturas exprimeret, quas in responsione Petri relucere conspicimus. 1 Tu nosti quòd amem te amore desiderii. 2 Tu nosti quòd amem te amore amicitiae. 3 Tu nosti quòd amem te amore excellentiae. Hisce enim tribus quasi gradibus ad summum divini amoris fastigium per∣venitur. Primò Deum propter nos ipsos diligimus, deinde à rivis bonitatis
ad fontem naturae recurrentes, ipsum propter se amamus; denique omnis pulchritudinis & decoris florem, & perfectionis ipsius expressam imagi∣nem in ipso contemplantes, supra omnia ipsum, & in ipso, omnia ample∣ctimur. Cùm omnium quae antur, judice Augustino,Lib. 11. de Civ. Dei. c. 28. Utrum ipse a∣mor ametur di∣ctum est. Ama∣tur autem, & hinc probatur, quòd in omni∣bus quae recti∣ùs amantur, ipse magis ametur: neque enim vir¦bo nus meritò dicitur, qui scit quod bonum est, sed qui di∣ligit. amor ipse magis amandu∣sit, equidem libentèr amoris ipsius amorem aspirante numine, in pectoribus vestris hoc tempore accendere satagerem, nisi nuperrimè in hac coronâ licet non hoc in loco huic flammae oleum affudissem, & totum myrothecium ex∣hausissem. Adde quòd oratio Christi in amore non se sistat, quin imò amo∣rem ipsum gradum faciat ad solicitudinem pastoralem. Amas? pasce. Pascis? ita demum amas. Ille in amore prior est, qui plures perduxerit ad amorem Dei, ut scitè Bernardus. Dicit ei, Simon amas me plus quàm hi? Dicit ei Petrus, tu nosti quòd amem te. Quod hic in responsione Petri desideratur supplet modestia. Sciscitabatur Christus, non de amore , sed de amoris ipsius ardore, af∣fectu{que} vehementiore, amas me plus quàm hi? Petrus de amore timidè & diffidenter respondet, de gradu nihil omnino spondet. Piscator, nempe Petrus, ictus sapuit, & qui primas obtinere non poterat prudentiae, secundas tenet mo∣destiae. Quando plus pollicitus fuerat quàm caeteri, minus praestitit; ideò{que} quo plus praestet, minus nunc pollicetur. Didicerat experimento se Chri∣sto notiorem quàm sibi, at{que} idcircò non jam ampliùs suâ conscientiâ, sed Christi scientiâ nititur, inquiens, tu nosti, Domine, tu omnia nosti,Apoc. 2.23. tu renes & corda scrutaris, tu animorum latebras excutis, tu intimos hominum sen∣sus perspectos habes, & exploratos, nec latere te potest affectus, quem ipse impressisti: cur ergo toties repetitâ interrogatione eum qui te deperit ene∣cas? Actum de me est, & spes omnis conclamata, si amorem meum Dominus meus habeat su spectum. Ad haec Christus nihil refert aliud, quam pasce, pasce, pasce. 1 Pasce mente. 2 Pasce ore. 3 Pasce opere. Pasce animiBern. Serm. Pasch. devotione, pasce verbi exhortatione, pasce exempli exhi∣bitione. Pasce agnos, pasce oves, pasce oves: semel ait pasce agnos, bis pasce o∣ves, fortè, quia agni simplici lactis cibo contenti esse debeant, oves cibo multiplici. 1 Modo solido doctrinae. 2 Modo dulci consolationis. 3 Modo amaro reprehensionis sunt pascendi. Nam si quis aurium delicatiorum verba tantum byssina plumea{que} probet, quasi nihil nisi rosas, quod aiunt, spirare debeamus, noscat ille apes alveos suos amarioribus succis illinere, adversas aliarum bestiarum aviditates: & à medicis discat nulla remedia tam facere dolorem, quam quae sunt saluta∣ria: aut si malit à theologis, discat virgam cum Manna, seu sacrum ana∣thema Arcae inclusum fuisse.Ep. 19. ad Eust Et quoniam mel (ut observat Hieronymus) in sacrificiis Dei non offertur, nimia dulcedo arte mutata est, & quadam
piperis austeritate condita. Apud Deum nihil tantum suave placet nisi quod habet in se aliquid mordacis veritatis. Pascha Domini cum amaris herbis erat comedendum; & omnis oblatio Christiana sale est condienda. Hinc est quòd Christus Petro mandat primò , tum  veritate do∣ctrinae,  severitate disciplinae;  verbo & exemplo,  vir∣gâ & baculo: de quibus appositèIn Job. exp. mor. l. 27. Gregorius, Virgâ percutimur, & baculo sustentamur: sit ergo discretio virgae quae feriat, & consolatio bacúli quae sustentet. Quos tandem? Non hircos lascivos, non sues immundas, non lupos voraces, non pardalos maculosos, non leones truces, non ursos saevos, non vulpes astutas, sed Agnos & oves. Sincerum, simplex, & sine fraude pecus. Etenim Deus qui omnibus fluviis Silunta placidè & leniter fluentem, omni∣bus arboribus vitem ramo, & folio, & flagellis, & fructu tenerrimis, omni∣bus floribus lilium sine spinis, omnibus volucribus columbam felle caren∣tem: idem omnibus animalibus agnos & oves praetulit, & in peculium suum ascivit: hae nam{que} solae audiunt vocem ejus,Mat. 11.29. Discite à me, quôd mitis sim & hu∣milis corde. Omnes Christi Discipuli vel agni sunt lacte fidei{que} rudimentis a∣lendi, vel oves sunt ad virentia sacrae Scripturae prata, & vivas Spiritus sancti scaturigines, ut sitim animae restinguant, deducendae: quas quia Dominus sui sanguinis pretio acquisivit, meritò suas indigitat, ne tanquam nostras tondere, ne dum deglubere aut mactare audeamus. Interim luculenter te∣statur Christus quanti faciat salutem nostram, dum ita singulariter pastori∣bus eam commendet, atque hoc sibi documentum fore asserat quantopere ab illis ametur, si eam solicitè curent. Nihil certè efficaciùs dici potuit ad animandos evangelii ministros, quàm dum audiunt nullum gratius officium esse, quàm quod pascendo ejus gregi impenditur; piis autem omnibus non vulgaris inde haurienda est consolatio, dum se filio Dei tam charos esse ac pretiosos audiunt, ut eos quasi in locum suum surroget: sed eadem doctrina non parum terroris incutere debet falsis doctoribus,Calv. in hunc loc. qui Ecclesiae regimen pervertunt, quia non leves Christo poenas daturi sunt, qui se ab illis violari pronunciat. Posui vobis ob oculos, viri, patres, & fratres in Christo dilectissimi, praecipua doctrinae & exhortationis capita in hoc sacro contextu expressa ad vivum, & filo aureolo intexta, quem sic deducere liceat; Simon Jonae non jam amplius Petre, cum levissimâ aurâ, spiritu nimirum ancillae concussus, & de tuâ statione dimotus fueris, num quemadmodum prae te fers, me prae omnibus in sinu & delitiis habes? ideone te in mare projecisti, quòd amoris ardorem ferre non possis? ideone Johannem cursu superasti, ut a∣moris palmam ei praeriperes? age itaque, ostende reipsâ quantopere Do∣minum tuum ex animo colas: en campum in quo excurrere amor tuus, cognoscique possit, en materiem & segetem virtutis tuae; oves mihi sunt, pretio sanguinis constantes, prae fame sitique jamjam moriturae: has pasce, iterum pasce, ac tertiò dico pasce. 1 Pasce verbo. 2 Pasce Sacramento. 3 Pasce disciplinâ.
Quò turpiùs prolapsus es, eò alacriùs resurge, & constantiùs me sequere usque ad aram crucis: sic amorem prómissum praestabis, dignitatem a∣missam recuperabis, & trinae negationis maculam, partim triplici pascendi diligentiâ, partim Martyrii patientiâ: partim sudore, partim cruore elues. Atque hunc quidem exitum habuit, ut pulchrè depingitTract. 123. in Johan. Augustinus, ille negator & amator, praesumendo elatus, negando prostratus, flendo purga∣tus, confitendo probatus, patiendo coronatus: hunc invenit exitum, ut pro ejus nomine perfectâ dilectione moreretur, cum quo se moriturum perver∣sâ festinatione promiserat: ita enim oportebat, ut priùs Christus pro Petri salute, deindè Petrus pro Christi praedicatione moreretur. Renunciare filia Sionis, Ecce, venit tibi Rex tuus mitis & mansuetus,Mat. 21.5. qui arundinem comminutam non confregit,Mat. 12.20. imò in calamum aromaticum convertit, & linum fumigans non extinxit, imò amoris igne accendit, ut lucem Evangelii toti terrarum orbi porrigeret. Improbè, inquit ille,Eras. Adag. Nep∣tunum incusat, qui bis naufragium fecit: Petrus verò etiam ter fidei pro∣fessionis, famaeque naufragium fecerat: poenitentiâ tamen quam elegan∣tèr vocat Hieronymus, tabulam post naufragium, sustentatus è tentatio∣num fluctibus enatavit, & Dominum in littore offendit prandium ei ap∣parantem, & amicè compellantem, Petre, amas me? Frustra Judaeo spicu∣latori dica scribitur, quòd Christi manus violaverit: in cassum Romani militis nomen defertur, quòd latus ejus transverberarit. tu Petre Do∣minum tuum vulnerasti, tu confodisti, tu perfidâ negatione perjurio im∣plicitâ cor ipsum servatoris tui transfixisti: audes tamen in amplexus ejus ruere? audes Dominum appellare, quem abnegasti? salutare, quem abdi∣casti? invocare, quem ejurasti? Ecquis jam ad gratiam & misericordiam sibi viam desperatione intercludet? ecquis sceleribus ingemiscens Deum fore placabilem & propitium diffidet? Cùm videat Petram scandali, & lapidem offensionis in gemmam mutatum, & inter pretiosos illos lapides, quibus superna CivitasApoc. 21.19 inaedificata est, refulgentem. Discamus, patres & fratres, hoc Domini nostri exemplo conservis no∣stris, etiamsi animos nostros exulceraverint, ignoscere, poenasque etiam debitas remittere in tempore. PerperàmArist. rhet. l. 2. . Aristoteles summâ in laude po∣nit vindictae studium, quasi justitiae & fortitudinis prolem communem. Christus enim qui via est & veritas, consulit reditum in gratiam cum ad∣versario, dum sumus in viâ, utut justas offensionis causas praebuerit, irae∣que fomitem copiosum subministraverit: nec enim convenit cum ipse Do∣minus peccata nostra digito scripserit in pulvere, Johan. 8.6. nos conservo∣rum injurias marmori insculpere, idque stilo adamantino, ad diuturnam, si non aeternam .

Caveant interim moneo, ne in nervum erumpat istaec fortitudo, & anseres a∣pud Plinium referre videantur, qui apprehensâ radice morsu saepè conantes avellere, ante colla sua abrumpunt. Pessimè sibi & posteris suis consuluit Tarquinius ille superbus (qui postea exactus est) summa papaverum capita decutiendo: debuit potiùs ex Apollonii Tyanei sententiâ infimas noxia∣rum herbarum radices evellere. Haeccine illa lenitas & mansuetudo est, quam Christus Dominus tacendo docuit, cùm velut ovis mactationi destinata, & velut agnus coramEsa. 53.7. Heb. 10.30. Rom. 12.19. tonsore os non aperuit? Sed non ero diutiùs (quod aiunt) unguis in hoc ulcere animorum, cui sua∣derem ex Tertulliani &Cyp. ser. 3. de bon. Patient. Cypriani praescriptionibus illud emplastrum adhi∣beri, Vindicta mea est, ego rependam, dicit Dominus. Idoneus potentiae nostrae sequestor Deus est, hunc expectemus, patres & fratres, judicem & vindicem Ecclesiae suae populum, & ab initio mundi justorum omnium numerum secum paritur vindicaturum. Qui ad vindictam suam nimiùm properat & festinat, consideret, quia nec dum vindicatus est ipse qui vin∣dicat. Caeterùm quoniam ex hoc loco potissimùm Pontificii culmen Papatus nituntur adstruere, quò Babylonicam illam turrem ab imis subruam fun∣damentis, ostendam primò summam potestatem Ecclesiasticam Petro his verbis non fuisse demandatam, proindè non exercuisse; deindè non exer∣cuisse, proindè nec Christum hoc loco ei demandasse. Nempe ut ilex tonsa bipennibus ab ipso ducit opes animumque ferro;Horat. ita veritas catholicae fidei ab ipsis adversariorum telis vires sumit ad istum modum. Fatentur Papicolae omnes Pontificiam cathedram aut hic à Christo stabiliri, aut nusquam: summa enim omnium argumentorum huc redit. Itaque si hunc locum de quo seriò triumphant, in quo omnia causae suae praesidia constituunt, è ma∣nibus eorum extorsero; cedant, & in gravissimâ & planè supremâ de prin∣cipatu Pontificis controversiâ herbam porrigant necesse est. Age itaque, singulas contextus circumstantias, singulas voculas & literarum tendiculas excutiamus, ex quibus nescio quibus fidiculis elicitur Papatus. Jesus dixit Simoni, ergo soli Simoni? pasce, ergo regio more impera? oves meas, ergo universam Ecclesiam in toto terrarum orbe propagatam? Hìc quia ut scitè Hieronymus, quod sine Scripturae authoritate, addo & rectâ ratiotianatione affertur, pari facilitate rejicitur, quâ asseritur eo inficias primùm soli Petro fuisse praeceptum, Pasce: ad hoc ipsum enim pascendi mandatum sancti Pa∣tres (ut infrà ostendam) illa Domini verba accommodant, Quod uni dico, om∣nibus dico. Secundò, pernego pascendi praeceptum vel innuere dominandi potestatem: Petrus ipse sententiam ex his verbis planè repugnantem ex∣piscatus est,1 Pet. 5.3. pascite gregem Domini, non dominantes clero. Ac si rem pe∣nitius introspiciamus pabulum subministrare, quae vis est vocis ; po∣tius ad servi officium spectat, quàm Domini potestatem. Nec aliud voce  quàm  denotatur: nam quo argumento Augustinus concludit,
&  idem sonare, quod in repetendâ eâdem interrogatione Do∣minus, modò unam, modò alteram vocem assumat, eodem convincam ver∣bum  &  eodem recidere, quod nimirum in ejusdem mandati in∣culcatione Christus modò hoc modò illud vocabulum  usurpet. Id∣circo Syrica, vetus & vulgata versio latina in tribus hisce versiculis trinum Christi mandatum iisdem verbis effert. Quin & nostra quoque Anglicana editio  eandem vocem ubique retinet, nec est sanè quod mutet. Nam , si Etymon spectes, quid est aliud quam  si u∣sum, communi pastorum officio designando adhibetur,1 Pet. 5.2. cujus duo munia in sacrâ paginâ distinguntur, alterum pascendi doctrinâ,Act. 2.28. alterum disciplinâ regendi: regendi vero pedo pastorali, non sceptro regali. Quantumvis enim Homerus Agamemnonem belli ducem , appellitet, & Deus ipse Cyrum Persarum principemEsa. 44.28. pastorem suum nuncupet, cujus rationem luculentam Cyrus ipse apudXen. cyr. paed. l. 8. . Xenophontem reddere videtur: nunquam ta∣men sacra Scriptura aut Patres quod sciam magistratum civilem pastoris o∣vium Christi titulo insigniunt: non sunt certè synonima pastor populi, & pa∣stor ovium Christi, nedum pastor ovium, & aspectabilis Ecclesiae monarcha; cui unquam principi Christiano Christus in mandatis dedit, pasce oves meas? cùm ipsi pastores populi, oves sint Christi pastoris & pastorum Christi quod veteres Augusti probè intellexerunt dum ad Christi altare si∣ne diademate, sine satellitibus, sine caeteris magistratus infulis accederent, significantes (ut piè notatLib. de libert. eccles. Caussobonus) intra Ecclesiae septum se quoque o∣ves esse, solumque Christum potestatem habere. Tertiò, nunquam efficient adversarii pronomen meas ad omnes in univer∣sum Christi oves necessariò extendi. HabeoJohan. 10.16. oves, inquit Christus, quae non sunt ex hac caulâ, puta Judaicâ, oves illae erant Christi oves, non tamen omnes Christi oves sed ovilis pars aliquota. Ecquis vero animum induxe∣rit suum, omnes Christi oves ab unius mortalis animâ pendere, Christumve omnium ovium ab initio promulgati Evangelii pereuntium sanguinem repe∣titurum à Petro? cui quidem oves suas indefinitè, aut si malint quaslibet communiter cómendavit, ut Apostolo, nulli certo gregi addicto: non omnes universè ut pastori oecumenico. Cur ergo Petrum Dominus seorsim allo∣quitur? eique nominatim, idque ter praecipit, Pasce? Respondent antiqui patres, non ut triplicem ei coronam contexeret, sed ut triplicis negationis memoriam ei refricaret: non ut monarchiam quam fingunt adversariiMat. 16.18. pro∣missam in personâ ejus institueret, sed ut Apostolatus dignitatem amissam restitueret trina professio, & triplex interrogatio, & ter repetitum manda∣tum infirmitatis Petri subsidia erant, non potestatis argumenta. Sed enim acriter instat Bellarminus, multisque argumentis contendit, Christum his verbis Petrum eumque solùm esse alloquutum, quem Simonem Jonae ap∣pellat, cui trinam negationem occultè exprobrat, quem in pristinum gradum reducit, eique martyrii coronam offert verbis sequentibus, Cùm senueris a∣lius te cinget, &c. Damus haec omnia, Bellarmine, sine causae dispendio. Quid enim si Christus Petrum seorsim & singulariter compellavit? exinde infe∣res Ecclesiae principem renunciasse, aut pascendi munus Petro soli imposi∣tum? aut ad eum solùm verba Christi pertinuisse? Perpende hoc argu∣mentum tuum, & nihil habere ponderis comperies. Quis enim ferret sic argumentantem? Petrus Simonem Magum nominatim perstringit, in∣quiens,
Fili Diaboli, plene omni dolo & malitiâ, pecunia tua tecum pereat: er∣go Petri verba ad eos nihil pertinent, qui in curiâ Romanâ hamo, ut dicitur, aureo piscantur: vel sic, Paulus Timotheum adjurat, O Timothee, serva de∣positum, hoc est, Catholicae fidei talentum, Interprete Vincentio Lirinensi; ergo fidei talentum soli Timotheo concreditum est? Christus Angelo Eccle∣siae Smyrnensis sic scribit,Apoc. 2.10. Esto fidelis usque ad mortem, & tibi dabo coro∣nam vitae; & Angelo Ephesino,Apoc. 2.5. Memento unde excideris, & resipisce; & Angelo Laodiceno,Apoc. 3.18. Eme à me aurum igne probatum, ut ditescas; & integu∣mentum, ut vestiaris; & collyrium, ut videas: ergone recipiscentia, con∣stantia, fides, zelus, unctio Spiritus, ipsaque adeo Christi imputata justitia non sunt omnium christianarum mentium ornamenta? Hic non animadver∣tit argutulus sophista se messes (quòd aiunt) suas urere. Nam si hoc pascen∣di praeceptum, ut ipse contendit, ad eum solùm spectat, qui a Jonâ oriundus, ter Christum ivit inficias, & trinam negationem trinâ priùs confessione, posteà & sanguine expiavit; nihil hìc Paulo quinto seritur, aut metitur; nihil ei oneris imponitur, aut muneris mandatur; ad eum haec verba non omninò spectant: non est enim a Jonâ credo oriundus, nec ter (opinor) statuit Do∣minum negare, nec dibaphum pontificium sanguine unquam tinget suo, nec de morte crucis (quam fortè mereri poterit) unquam cogitat.

Si peccaverit in te frater tuus, &c. quae dicuntur ei ratione aliquâ propriâ personae ipsius, ei solidicuntur, ut vade post me Satana, & ter me negabis: ista enim dicuntur ei ratione propriae imbecillitatis & ignoran∣tiae; quaedam deni{que} dicuntur ei ratione officii pastoralis, quae proindè dicta intel∣liguntur omnibus Pastoribus, ut, pasce oves meas, & conversus confirma fratres.

facilè est colligere, nunquam ei à Christo fuisse delegatam, quòd ut  evincam, edisseram. 1 Petrum non fuisse Apostolorum collegio praefectum. 2 Utut praefectus fuerit, non fuisse toti Ecclesiae praepositum. 3 Utut praepositus fuerit, hunc honorem ad successorem non fuisse delatum. 4 Utut delatus fuerit Pontificem Romanum hunc sibi vindicare non potuisse. 5 Utut vindicare potuisset, cum 700. à Christo nato annis non obtinue∣rit, nunc obtinere non posse: hisce quasi gradibus à fastigio turris Babylonicae ad fundamentum evertendum, descendam. Ac primò gradui summo insistam, & ipsum apicem sic adorior. Si nihil Petro promissum fuit, Mat. 16.19. nihil commissum, Johan. 21.16. quod non caeteris omnibus Apostolis pariter promissum, Mat. 18.18. & reipsâ praestitum collatumque, Johan. 20.22, 23. diplomate illo, Sicut misit me Pa∣ter, ita mitto vos; quorum peccata remiseritis, remissa sunt; quorum pecca∣ta retinueritis, retenta sunt. Si (ut Jacobum fratrem Domini, & dilectum Discipulum qui in sinu Jesu recubuerat, contentionis invidiâ liberem) B.

Nihilo sum inferior, seu nullâ in re cedo summis Apostolis? Hoc ait (inquit Ambrosius) Quia minor non est, neque in praedicatione, neque in signis edendis, neque dig∣nitate, sed tempore. Quin & ipseLeo in nat. Pet. & Paul. Leo pontifex, qui si quispiam alius aùtho∣ritatis pontificiae fimbrias dilatavit, omnia tamen in Petro & Paulo paria esse agnoscit, & ita paria, ut neque hic dignitate vinci potuerit, neque illum dignitate superaverit: De quorum meritis & virtutibus (inquit) quae omn superant loquendi facultatem nihil diversum, nihil sentire debemus discre∣tum, quia illos & electio pares, & labor similes & mors fecit aequales. Non fuit igitur Petrus Apostolici collegii praeses: fuerit, non tamen con∣tinuò universae Ecclesiae administrandae cura uni incubuit. Aliud est Aposto∣lorum caetui, aliud universo Christi gregi; aliud urbi, aliud orbi praeesse: aliud duorum scalmorum navigii in sinu Adriatico, aliud Argonavis, seu po∣tius universae classis Dominicae in ocaeano cursum moderari. Nunquid quia unus agricola uni agello colendo sufficit, torus perinde terrarum orbis erit uni vilico demittendus? nunquam profectò adversarii ex eo quod Petrus in∣ter Apostolos eminuit, efficient totius Ecclesiae gubernacula ei fuisse tradita. Nec enim Christus ipse qui per vicariam, ut appellat Tertullianus, vim spi∣ritus Ecclesiae perpetuò adest Episcoporum consiliis prae est, Ministrorum vocationi, verbi praedicationi, & sacramentorum administrationi interest, & omnia pastoris munia ad amussim praestat expletque, caret vicario. Nec si careret mortalium quisquam tanto muneri par esset sustinendo, ut in singulis Christi caulis perpetuò ageret, & universas Christi oves toto terrarum or∣be dispersas unus pasceret. Nec si quisquam huic oneri esset ferendo, ex usu foret Ecclesiae, ut ab extimis mundi oris & plagis remotissimis totus Christi grex ad unum confugeret, in negotio salutis & causâ fidei ab uno penderet, qui saepè incertus, semper majori diaeceseos parti absens, non rarò veritatis adversarius, & Ecclesiae perduellis extitit, ne dicam eum propriâ vi vocis pro Christo, seu vice Chri∣sti, ut apud Hom.  vicedeus, seu Deo simi∣lis, Il. 2. Antichristum censendum, qui se in Ecclesiâ pro Christo venditat, Christi ipsius locum arrogat, & omnes titulos capitis, fundamenti, sponsi Ec∣clesiae, universalis episcopi usurpat: à quo nomine tanquam profano, sacrile∣go, blasphemo, Antichristiano, Luciferiano semper abhorruit GregoriusGreg. epist. 32, 78, 80, 82, 83. magnus, qui bonorum pontificum agmen clausit. Nec turpissimam Anti∣christinotam pontificià pontifice inustamBellar. de Rom. Pontif. l. 2. c. 31. Bellarminus unquam eluet distin∣ctione suâ nimium dilutâ Episcopi universalis, qui ita dicitur (inquit) vel ut intelligatur esse solus Episcopus omnium christianarum urbium, ita ut cae∣teri non sint Episcopi, sed illius tantum vi rii: & hoc sensu nomen hoc Gregorio profanum, sacrilegum, antichristianum visum est; vel dicitur universalis Episcopus qui generalem habet curam totius Ecclesiae, ita ut non excludat particulares Episcopos, & hoc sensu Gregorio ipsi arrisit titulus
universalis. Siccine verò Bellarmine? si haec responsio tua Gregorio arrisit, ridendus est certè ipse Gregorius, qui tantoperè exarsit in Johannem Con∣stantinopolitanum, non quod omnes Episcopos suâ dignitate spoliare, sed quod novo & inusitato titulo novam in Episcopos omnes authoritatem si∣bi vindicare videretur. Audiamus ipsumGreg. ep. 82. Gregorium irâ inflammatum, ver∣borum fulmina in Patriarcham Constantinopolitanum conjicientem. Si PaulusEp. 82. membra dominici corporis certis extra Christum capitibus, & ipsis quidem Apostolis subjici particulariter evitavit, tu quid Christo universalis scilicet Ecclesiae capiti in extremi judicii es dicturus examine, qui cuncta ejus membra tibimet conaris universalis appellatione supponere? Quis rogo in hoc tam perverso vocabulo, nisi ille ad imitandum, proponitur, qui despectis An∣gelorum legionibus secum socialiter constitutis, ad culmen conatus est singula∣ritatis erumpere, ut & nulli subesse, & solus videretur omnibus praeesse? Et a∣libi in eundem, Quia juxta est ille de quo scriptum est, ipse est rex superbiae, super universos filios superbiae, quod non sine gravi dolore dicere compellor, frater & co-episcopus noster Johannes mandata dominica, Apostolica praecepta, regulas pacis despiciens, eum per elationem praecurrere conatur in nomine ex eo in quo sedebat cinere, ex eâ quam praetendebat humilitate jactantiam sumpsit, ita ut universa sibi tentet ascribere, & omnia quae soli uni capiti co∣haerent Christo per elationem pompatici sermonis, ejusdem Christi sibi studeat membra subjugare. Haec & similia in epistolis passim Gregorius quae au∣thoritati pontificiae securim injiciunt, quam cote dialecticâ sic exacuo. Quicunque universalis Episcopi nomen usurpat, cuncta Christi membra, quae soli uni capiti cohaerent Christo, conatur sibi sup∣ponere, & subjugare, & ad culmen singularitatis erumpere, ut & nulli subesse, & solus velit omnibus praeesse: is est Luciferi discipu∣lus, Antichristi prodromus (si Gregorio fides.) At Pontifex Romanus jamdiu nomen universalis Episcopi usur∣pavit, & indies conatur universa Christi membra sibi supponere, & ad culmen singularitatis jamdudum erupit, ut & nulli subesse, & solus velit omnibus praeesse. Ergo Pontifex Romanus calculo Gregorii damnatur, & ad in∣feros cum Lucifero & Antichristo amandatur. Cum hunc nodum Gordianum (Gregorianum dicerem) solverint adver∣sarii, duriorem iis adhuc provinciam imponam, ut argumento aliquo solido confirment, dignitatis Petri praerogativam ad omnes successores quales tan∣dem cunque fuerint, jure veluti haereditario pertinere, quasi Christus prin∣cipatus si quis tandem, sit, seu primatus potiùs in Ecclesiâ fundandâ hono∣rem non Petri personae & fidei, sed sedi & loco detulisset, cum jam Petrus nusquam cathedram collocasset. Certè verba illa, Et ego etiam tibi dico, Pe∣tre, tu es Petrus, &c. ad Petri professionem apertè respiciunt, & hunc sensum prae se ferunt: Tu me, Petre, omnium primò coeli haeredem, & Ecclesiae ca∣put professus es: ego itidem tibi profiteor me tibi primùm claves▪ regni coelorum in manus daturum, teque intra Ecclesiae fundamenta seu lapidem pretiosum in primo ordine positurum. Quem honorem Petri successor, ideo sibi nequit arrogare, quia Petrus sibi aeternùm retinet: non secus ac A∣brahamo
patri fidelium, & Patriarchis in vet. Test. qui duodecim stellis inApoc. 1.1. Apocalypsi assimilantur; duodecim quo{que} Apostolis suus in coelo honos illibatus reservatur, ibi enim tanquam gemmae inApoc. 21.19. fundamento muri sanctae urbis collucent, & inter eas Petrus tanquam Jaspis primo loco conspicitur. Si haec pontificiis ratio minus allubescat, assignent ipsi rationem cur Petro soli succedatur in honore, non itē reliquis? seu potiùs cur Petro ipsi in prin∣cipatu succedatur, non in Apostolatu: si Apostolatus in exemplum trahi ne∣quit, nedum principatus ille quem fingunt Apostolorum? ut hoc peracutum Junii telum frustrentur, nunquam tamen Tertulliani interrogationi satis∣facient. Si quia Petro dixerat Dominus,Tertul. lib. de pudicit. c. 21. Super hanc petram aedificabo Ec∣clesiam meam, & quodcunque ligaveris in terrâ, erit ligatum in coelo; idcirco praesumis ad te derivasse hanc solvendi & ligandi potestatem, qua∣lis tu es evertens & commutans manifestam Domini intentionem perso∣naliter hoc Petro conferentis. Quod si praerogativa Petri dignitas ex Christi institutione personalis fuerat, successio loci hìc locum non ha∣bet. Etenim episcopatus Petri ut omnium Apostolorum , nul∣lis loci cancellis erat circumscriptus, nedum rupi Tarpeiae affixus. Ad∣de, quod si ideo Romano Episcopo primae deferendae sint, quia Petri audit successor, Hierosolomytanus & Ephesinus Patriarchae, qui Johan∣ni & Jacobo successerunt, saltem in secundis tertiisve consisterent: at secundum locum semper tenuit Alexandrinus, tertium Antiochenus, ul∣timum Hierosolomytanus, Ephesinus ne in extremo quidem angulo haesit. Quis verò adducatur ut credat Petro mortuo Linum Petri ut fertur successorem ad clavum totius orbis Christiani sedisse, Johanne praesertim Apostolo & Marco Evangelista superstitibus? haec clarissima Ecclesiae lumina Lino nescio cui tanquam capiti subjicere cujus tandem fu∣erit ignorantiae, ne dicam stultitiae? Sed largiamur adversariis quod nunquam vi rationis, aut Scripturae autho∣ritate evincent, dignitatem Petri successoribus in universum omnibus cōmu∣nicatam, & certae etiam cathedrae implicitam & annexam: ne sic tamen Eccle∣sia Romana obtinebit principatum. Interveniet Antiochena, & eam ex jure manu consertam vocabit, quod temerè in ipsius possessiones & privilegia in∣vaserit: satis enim ex ipsis sacris literis constare Ecclesiam Antiochenam primam Christi fide imbutam, & Christianae titulo insignitam: in ea Pe∣trum Apostolorum principem cathedram collocasse, exHom. 3. ad pop. Antioch. Chrysostomo eam Christo charissimam, omnium{que} civitatum sub oriente principem: exEp. 48. Ba∣silio inde tanquam ex capite in totum Ecclesiae corpus sanitatem derivari, demùm ex Matthaeo Parisiensi suum antistitem in Pontificem ipsum Roma∣num sub annum 1238. excommunicationis gladium strinxisse, quid hic comminiscuntur Romanenses? Petrum cathedram pontificalem ab Antio∣chiâ Romam transtulisse ibi{que} (credo Dei Termini operâ) qui nulli cedit, immotam fixisse. Non ergo jam verbis Christi, sed facto Petri nititur Papa∣tus. Esto, factum hoc Petri ubi scriptis consignatur? quo teste probatur? Non in tabulas profectò sacras refertur, nec publicas. Apocryphi quidam autho∣res aliquid memoriae produnt, quorum in multis fides laborat: nec hi tamen asserunt Petrum Romae cathedram statuminasse, nedum immobiliter, mini∣mè omnium jure divino. Narrant tantum Petrum Antiochiae Romam mi∣grasse, ibi{que} martyrii coronâ redimitum. Palmarium planè argumentum:
Petrus Romae cruci suffixus est; ergo fixit ibi cathedram pontificiam. An non Christus ipse Hierosolymae fuit in crucem sublatus, & primatus honorem loco Christus morte suâ acquirere non potuit, Petrus potuit? Istâ ratione probarem cathedram summi pontificatus in deserto statuendam, quòd ibi summus pontifex Aaron stolam pontificiam exuens expiraverit. En quò tan∣dem recidit res: fides pontificia Ecclesiae, Ecclesia pontificis Romani cathe∣drâ, cathedra Romani pontificis Petri successione, Petri demùm successio tenuissimâ conjecturâ ex narratione authorum fidei dubiae ductâ nititur. De quâ Bellarminus ipse timidè & diffidentèr loquitur, Cùm Petrus,Lib. 2. de Rom. Pontif. c. 12. Domino jubente, Romam venerit, & ibi martyrium pertulerit, non improbabile est Do∣minum jussisse ut Romae sedem figeret, & Romanus pontifex ei absolutè succe∣deret, & si fortassè non est de jure divino Romanum pontificem, quâ Romanus pontifex est succedere in praefecturâ totius Ecclesiae: ergone quod non est im∣probabile, quod forte est, forte non est, de fide est? imò fidei catholicae basis substernitur & fundamentum? Satis mihi videor quatuor columnas, quibus fabrica papatus incumbit, convellisse & labefactasse: quintum restat ut aggrediar, quam cum nube testi∣um, & procellâ rationum & exemplorum obruero, magnae Babylonis ne∣cesse erit, Ut collapsa ruant subductis tecta columnis. Petrus caeteris Apostolis dignitate & honore non praeluxit, praeluxerit: sum∣ma tamen potestas Ecclesiastica penes ipsum non resedit, resederit; haec po∣testas ad successores non fuit derivata, derivata fuerit; cathedrae Romanae non fuit alligata, fuerit alligata; tamen cùm tot pontifices qui Romae na∣scente, & adultâ Ecclesiâ sederunt, hanc aut sibi non vindicaverint, aut si vindicaverint, non obtinuerint, post tantum temporis intervallum non po∣terit jam pontifex jus suum (si unquam suum, quod inficiamur) velut post∣liminio recuperare. Age itaque, annales replicemus, & ex his potissimùm hanc litem dirima∣mus hunc in modum. 1 Quem antiqui Episcopi purioribus temporibus à fastu seculi remoti∣oribus, modò fratrem, modò collegam, modò consodalem,Vid. Cypr. ep. 1. ad Jubaian. modò Romae Sacerdotem, & urbis Episcopum salutarunt, aliquando etiam liberè & a∣cerbè increparunt: ad quem, testeEp. 288.

temporis summus causarum ecclesiasticarum Judex. 4 Is qui in conciliis celeberrimis nec per se, nec per legatos praesedit; imò quo invito & reluctante concilia coacta sunt, canones editi, Episcopi confir∣mati & depositi, non fuit supremus Ecclesiae dictator. 5 Denique, is cujus literae repudiatae, minae spretae, sententiae rescissae, er∣rores notati, haereses damnatae, legati repudiati, ipse etiam cathedrâ excussus, & de culmine Papali deturbatus, non fuit aspectabilis Ecclesiae summus mo∣narcha, illis saltem seculis quibus haec non abhaereticis, sed à catholicis passus est.

Caeterùm, ut officii hujus onus & amplitudo plurimùm deprimit, ita dignitas erigat animos nostros necesse est, cum seriò cogitemus Christum Dominum praetiosissimum illud depositum, pro quo animam suam posuit, oves illas pro quibus pastor se devovit, oves pro quibus tanquam ovis est ductus ad mactandum, illas inquam oves quas sanguine suo abluit, & auteo justitiae suae vellere integit, nostrae curae fideique commisisse. Non poterat Christus singularis illius amoris quo Johannem prae caeteris est complexus, luculentius specimen edere, quam cum inter horrendos animi corporisque cruciatus jamjam expiraturus matrem ipsi commendavit hisce verbis, Ecce matrem tuam: vobis verò etiam quam matre non minus charam habuit di∣lectissimam sponsam commendatam reliquit, vosque ejus custodes & tuto∣res constituit. Atque ut haec cogitatio vobis summum gaudium & laetitiam qui pastores estis, affert: ita ex eodem fonte non vulgaris consolatio ovibus arcessenda est, cum subinde recolant eas Christo tam charas esse, ut ex ipsa∣rum curâ & solicitudine amorem nostrum erga ipsum metiatur: unde verè & severè ratiocinaturGreg. serm. in Evang. Gregorius, Si dilectionis testimonium est cura pasto∣ralis, quisquis virtutibus pollens gregem Dei renuit pascere, summum pastorem convincitur non amare. Hunc verò Paulus gravissimi anathematis fulmine percutit,1 Cor. 16.22. Quisquis (inquit) non amat Dominum Jesum, sit anathemamaran∣atha. Omne quod spirat, teste Plinio, vocem aliquam aut sonum licet inar∣ticulatum edit: ideò spiritus cum fonitu veluti turbinis specie linguarum ig∣nearum in Apostolos illapsus est, ut disceremus eos pastores Spiritu sancto repleri, quorum linguae sunt zelo Dei accensae, & vocis sonus tanquam tur∣binis templum Domini, & fidelium aures implet. Cuiconsonant aurea Aaro∣nis tintinnabula scitè pulsante eaVid. Greg. de curâ pastoral. part. 2. c. 4. Gregorio magno, Scriptum est, inquit, audiatur sonitus quando ingreditur, vel egreditur sanctuarium in conspectu Domini, & non moriatur, sacerdos namque ingrediens vel egrediens moritur si de eo sonitus non auditur, quia iram contra se occulti judicis erigit, qui sine sonitu praedicationis incedit. Equidem ab iis vehementer dissentio, qui eos tantùm agnoscunt pastores, quibus oves unius caulae (quam parochiam seu congregationem dictitant) septis conclusae commendantur: eos verò five praelectores, sive doctores, sive verbi divini ministros, qui in Academiâ ip∣sos pascunt pastores, hoc honore spoliant. Etenim meliùs deWaram. Arch. Cant. a∣pud Eras. in Ap. republicâ & ecclesiâ meretur, qui unum medicum quam qui multos imperitos curaverit. Adde quod si hi fontes Heliconis sitiant, illorum rivi in vicis pagisque citò arescant necesse est. Nec eos violati praecepti Dominici insimulo, qui Hie∣rosolymae ad tempus sanctum spiritum praestolantur in ipsos descensurum: Hi enim conchas marinas quae margaritas concipiunt,Plin. nat. hist. l. 9. c. 35. referunt: Hae namque ubi genitalis anni stimulaverit hora, pandunt se quasi oscitatione, donec roscido conceptu impleantur, gravidae postea enituntur, & pro qualitate roris hic imbi∣biti pariunt margaritas: quibus Sponsam Christi mirificè ornant & illu∣strant. Utinam plures tales conchas haberemus: nunc verò, ut scitè Bernar∣dus, Canales multos hodie habemus in Ecclesiâ, conchas paucas, tantae chari∣tatis
sunt, per quos nobis fluenta coelestia dimanant, ut priùs effundere quàm infundi velint, loqui quàm audire paratiores, prompti docere quod nunquam didicerunt. Nec sanè mirum est hos saepiùs de faece (utaiunt) haurire, cùm tam facilè ubivis exiguum illud, quod plerumque non ex ipsis fontibus coelestis doctrinae, sed aliorum puteis contritis collegerunt, expromant. Hos tamen angustos canales, seu potiùs fractas cisternas aquam continere non valentes, tubis illis aureis longè capacissimis praefero, in quibus aquae coe∣lestes, quia meatus obturati sunt, putrescunt. Nolo in eos aliquid acer∣biùs statuere, quàm statuit olim ipse Gregorius; Sunt nonnulli, inquit, qui magnis muneribus ditati, dum solis contemplationis studiis inardescunt, parere utilitati proximorum praedicatione refugiunt, secretum quietis diligunt, secessum speculationis petunt; de quo si districtè judicentur, ex tantis procul dubio rei sunt,Greg. de cur. past. quantis venientes ad publicum prodesse potu∣erunt. Sed ut clariùs adhuc perspiciatis, in quos orationis meae aculei erigantur, , Pastores in quatuor genera dispertiam, aut enim ex iis sunt qui om∣ninò non pascunt, aut non oves, aut non Christi oves, aut noncibo idoneo. 1 Genus eorum est, qui nec se pascunt, nec oves. 2 Eorum, qui se pascunt, non oves. 3 Eorum, qui oves pascunt, sed non Christi. 4 Eorum qui oves Christi pascunt, sed non salubri gramine, sed cicutâ, herbisque noxiis. Hos omnes cùm officii in mentem revocavero, praeceptisque & minis dominicis, sanctionibusque Apostolicis, veluti stimulis quibusdam fodica∣vero, perorabo. 1 Ac primò illis litem intendo, qui nec se pascunt, nec oves; qui in agro dominico nec cogunt, nec spargunt: sed in Academiâ, aut occupati infelici∣tèr, aut malè feriati consenescunt. Ex hoc genere alii sicci sunt & sobrii, qui abdicatis bonarum artium, & sacrarum literarum studiis, se curâ rei fa∣miliaris & negotiis secularibus ferè implicant: alii factioni fovendae, & parti cui tanquam scopulo adhaerescunt, amplificandae evehendaeq́ue tem∣pus transmittunt: alii tanquam milites Mariani paludibus Minturnensibus immerguntur, popinis dico & tabernis, in quibus non Minervae & Musis, sed Veneri & Baccho diurna & nocturna sacra faciunt, quo cum incaluerint in Magistratus, in privatos, in optimum quemque, in omnes ordines (horres∣co referens) in religionem, in fidem, in sacram Scripturam, in Deum ipsum despumant: ad extremum, postquam patrimonium, famam, fidem, tempus, ingenium, omnesque animi & corporis dotes in foedissimas voluptates pro∣fuderint & prodegerint, turpem vitam infami exitu concludunt, nescias pri∣usne animam an crapulam exhalent.

Attamen ex hac hominum colluvie nonnulli ad me∣liorem frugem, nec tamen bonam redeunt, subducunt se ex iis inquibus diu meruerant castris, curiam advolant, nobili aut magnati adhaerent, & sub illius umbrâ paulisper delitescunt, postea Academiam repetunt: ac utCic. de Ha∣rusp. resp. Vatinias strumam suam pontificio dibapho, ita hi prioris vitae tenebras & sor∣des purpurâ academicâ tegunt, & ita demum turpibus obsequiis, & arti∣bus (ut aiunt) simonaicis ad praefecturas & dignitatum apices ascendunt, & Ecclesiae bona quae per scelus adepti sunt, per luxum effundunt.

Non tamen possunt aut debent docti Scribae in domo Dei Icona & imagi∣nem Christi Domini penicillo ductam parvi pendere.Mat. 13.52. Scriba in regno Dei doctus (inquit) est patri familiae similis, qui de thesauro suo depromit nova & vetera, non qui in thesauro servat recondita. Dispar siquidem & longè dissimilis est nummi corradendi, & hujus thesauri congerendi ratio: illi ser∣vando crescunt, expendendo minuuntur, hi servando minuuntur, conge∣runtur dissipando, retinentur impertiendo; si parcas perdis, si prodigas par∣cis, amittis si recondas, si distribuas custodis: non erunt diu tui si sint solius tui. Itaque graviter monetLib. 12. con∣fes. c. 25. Veri∣tas nec tua, nec mea, nec illius, est, aut illius, sed omnium nostrum quos ad ejus com∣munionem publicè vocas: terribiliter ad∣monens, ne, &c.

Spartae olim laudi dabatur, quod in eâ homines optimè consenescerent, at hoc ipsum maximè vitio vertitur Academiis nostris, quòd in iis doctissimi viri de maturo in vineam Dominicam ingressu neutiquam soliciti, pessimè consenescant: siquidem Academiae sunt Ecclesiae & Rei∣publicae seminaria, in quibus plerunque feracissima ingenia, ut rosae eodem horto diutiùs consistentes sylvescunt, aut sterilescunt, translatione verò & ipsâ plantatione proficiunt. Hierosolymae moram 40. duntaxat dierum Christus Apostolis imperavit, Ecclesia mater indulgentissima tot annorum commorationem in hac florentissimâ Academiâ sacrarum literarum, studi∣osis etiam sacerdotio aut dignitate Ecclesiasticâ auctis, quibusdam de causis indulget: quos qui superant, & ultra 50. imò & 60. annos, & ultimam us{que} ad senectutem, & extremum spiritum ad Verbi ministerium, & Evangelii praeconium hîc se parant, instruuntque; reliquum est, ut apud inferos habeant conciones. Cedrorum duo genera, refertPlin. nat. hist. l. 14. c. 5. Cedri Majoris duo genera, quae floret fructum non fert, fru∣gifera non flo∣ret. Plinius, unum quod floret qui∣dem, fructum verò nullum affert; alterum quod flore caret, fructus tamen ubertate hunc defectum quodammodo compensat: simillima est sacerdotum & Verbi ministrorum ratio: qui festinant & sacris quam primum ordini∣bus initiantur, flosculos emittunt, hoc est, ostentationis pleni sunt, fructum verò perexiguum, aut nullum ferunt: qui è Fabio cunctatore oriundi sunt, & serò in sacerdotum collegium se recipiunt, fructum quidem nonnulli proferunt, sed specie carent & floris decore: superest igitur ut verbi praeco∣nes futuri maturent, & praecocibus tardiùs cunctatoribus citiùs Ecclesiasti∣co muneri se accingant, ita fiet ut quod de patre refert Ausonius: Auson. in Epigr.Maturam frugem flore manente ferant. 3 Tertium genus eorum est, qui sedulò pascunt oves, sed non Christi oves, seu ut commodiùs rem explicat Augustinus, qui oves Christi pascunt, sed tanquam suas, non tanquam Christi, gloriam suam in iis pascendis quae∣runt, non Christi, emolumentum suum, non Christi. Hos Paulus perstrin∣git, Phil. 2.21. Omnes (inquit) quae sua sunt quaerunt, non quae sunt Jesu Christi: & acriùs insectatur, 2 Tim. 2.4, 5. Erunt homines sui amatores, pe∣cuniae avidi, gloriosi, superbi, maledici, ingrati, profani, charitatis exper∣tes, &c. En scaturiginem vitiorum impurissimam a fonte φιλαυτίασ manantem. Ne nos ergo sed Christum amemus, & in pascendis ejus ovibus, ejus com∣modis
non nostris serviamus: nescio quo enim inexplicabili modo, inquit Augustinus, fi, ut quisquis seipsum, non Deum amat, non se amet: & quis∣quis Deum, non seipsum amat, ipse verò se amet. 4 Postremum genus eorum est, qui oves Christi pascunt, sed cibo insa∣lubri, quo magis inficiuntur quàm reficiuntur Christi oves agnique: eorum dico qui floribus & fructibus Paradisi aut noxias herbas admiscent, aut flo∣res Adonidis adspergunt. Cujusmodi sunt ista dogmata, dari meritum ex congruo, ut non ex condigno vires liberiarbitrii ab Adamo lapsu ad bonum spirituale fractas, & debilitatas non penitus profligatas & amissas, labem originis nemini unquam fraudi fuisse, justificationum impii non in solidum imputatae Christi justitiae ascribendam, suas inhaerentis justitiae partes esse. Christum morte suâ nobis exemplum patientiae exhibuisse, non  pro peccatis persolvisse, fiduciam salutis propriae à praesumptione parum ut nihil differre, tutius esse à parte Bellarmini quàm Calvini stare; Calvinum enim blasphemias in Christum eructare, horrorem aeternae mortis, & de∣sperationem illi impingere in commentariis foedè hallucinari, non un∣quam ut ipsorum verbis utar, Judaizare, & in multis Arrianizare, ut de reli∣quis notis quas alii eluerunt nihil dicam, quid hoc sibi vult calumniae de Arinismo? nunquid Calvinus ejus{que} discipuli qui in Arrianos non stylum modo sed & gladium strinxerunt,Aristoph. in Plut. nuper evaserunt Arriani? Scitè Poeta ille, aversus sycophantae morsum nullum datur remedium: nam quantumvis ulcus curari posse videatur, manet tamen apud nonnullos infamiae cicatrix. Attamen quaero, quibus fidiculis è Calvini dictis aut scriptis elicient, aut Judaismum, aut Arrianismum? Calvinus (inquiunt) in sacrae paginae sensibus investigandis ferè vias à patribus tritas & consignatas relinquit: & saepè Ra∣binorum; est etiam ubi Arrianorum vestigiis insistit: Judaizat ergo, ergo Arrianizat Calvinus, mirum ni Papizet etiam: certè enim non rarò in sacrae Scripturae expositione patres deserit, & Pontificiorum Interpretum vesti∣gia premit. Quid hic tandem dignum virgulâ censoriâ? Nunquamne licet in sacrorum oraculorum interpretatione à sanctis patribus dissentire? Assenti∣untur ipsi patres licere; & patribus impendiò magis addicti Pontificii Caje∣tanus & Andradius, hic Lectori consulit, si in sensum aliquem incideret tex∣tui consonum, licet aliò rapiat sanctorū patrum torrens, non abduci, sed com∣modissimae interpretationi constare, ille ingenuè fatetur. Patres saepè genui∣num Scripturae sensum non assequi, quem tamen recentiores Theologi multum indagando repererunt: necesse est (inquit) fateamur, nisi praeclarissimis inge∣niis ingrati esse volumus, plurima in Mose & Prophetis esse, nostro hoc aevo doctorum hominum diligentiâ multô accuratiùs quàm unquam anteà explica∣ta. At (inquiunt) invidiosum est sanctis patribus refragari, & haereticis in e∣volvendis Scripturae sensibus suffragari. Si hoc sit vitio vertendum, faba cu∣denda erit in B. Hieronymum, qui in historiâ Melchizedeci illustrandâ quin∣que patrum sententias Hebraeorum opinioni posthabuit: Augustinus itidem ejusdem criminis affinis est, qui in Scripturae loco quodam explicando Cy∣prianum prius secutus, posteà incidit in aliam ejusdem loci in Tycone Do∣natistà expositionem; quam quia veriorem putabat, Cypriani Martyris interpretationi praetulit. Quid Hieronymum aut Augustinum comme∣moro? in B. Apostolum & Christum Dominum restat ut hi censores Cal∣vino mastiges animadvertant, qui quasdam veteris instrumenti sententias
ad normam Pharisaeorum ita interpretantur, ut ex iis resurrectionis doctri∣nam eliciant. Occurrent sat scio Christum Dominum, & B. Apostolum, & sanctos patres Hieronymum & Augustinum praelibatas interpretationes non ideò suo calculo comprobasse, quia à Judaeis aut Haereticis prolatae aut probatae fuerint: sed quia verae & proindè à Spiritu sancto dictatae: agnosco & addo, nisi livor in Genevates, aut propensior affectus in Romanenses eos transversos ageret; idem de Calvini & Anglo-Genevensium annotationibus aut interpretationibus à patrum orbitâ deflectentibus statuissent. Equidem non arbitror quenquam eorum qui Calvinum toties convitiis proscindunt in pontificiorum castra migrasse, illud tamen ausim affirmare, illos qui Bel∣larmino aequiores sunt, quàm Calvino à Papismo propiùs abesse, quàm il∣lum strenuum Christi athletam ab Arrianismo. Libet ergo symbolismum retorquere, & suis eos hastis transverberare. 1 Pontificiis solenne est quo doctrinae Protestantium conflent invidiam, omnes ansas arripere Calvino, Bezae, aliisque reformatae Ecclesiae Doctori∣bus detrahendi, detrahant hi non minus: symbolizant ergo cum pontificiis. 2 Decrevit Synodus Tridentina veterem & vulgatam editionem Lati∣nam ab Haebreo fonte (immanè quantùm discrepantem) omnibus versio∣nibus praeferendam, & in publicis lectionibus & disputationibus seu authen∣ticam proferendam: praeferunt hi, & proferunt in concionibus, & praelectio∣nibus spretâ Tremelianâ & quavis aliâ à reformatae Ecclesiae sive pastori∣bus, sive professoribus elucubratâ: symbolizant ergo cum pontificiis. 3 In plerisque Academiis transmarinis, in quibus obtinet Papismus, Pe∣trus Lumbardus, & Aquinas Neophytis in Theologiâ degustandi propo∣nuntur, ut Papismo eos penitùs imbuant, proponunt hi suis discipulis pri∣vatim legendos, & Calvinos, Zanchios, Ursinos tanquam levis armaturae milites contemptui habent: symbolizant ergo cum pontificiis. Accedam propiùs, & pedem (ut dicitur) conferam, non desunt ex his qui arctissimae amicitiae symbolum pontificiis dant, & ab iis accipiunt, an non hi cum pontificiis symbolizant? 4 Denique si valeat illud philosophicum axioma, symbolizantia elemen∣ta sunt, in quibus datur facilior transitus nullus dubito, ipsos citiùs ad ponti∣ficios, quam Calvinum ad Arrianos defecturum: praesertim cùm Calvinus & Genevenses hanc Arrianae haeresios notam non tam atramento suo, quàm sanguine Serveti Arriani effuso eluerint. Obstrepentes videor audire quos∣dam huic orationi meae, & tragicè exclamantes, sustinebisne venerandis Do∣ctoribus, aliisque clarissimis Academiae luminibus, apud quos Calvinus tuus meritò vapulat isto modo obtrectare? quibus liceat mihi regerere an ut Hie∣ronem refert Aelianus anteà indoctum per morbum factum doctissimum, ita quidam apud nos per morbum animi evadunt doctissimi? siccine res ha∣bet qui ex subraucidis pontificiorum, aut Lutheranorum adversariis cento∣nem possunt in Calvinum, Bezam, P. Martyrem, Piscatorem, aliosque ortho∣doxos contexere, ii soli Ambrosiâ alendi sunt; reliquos verò ex Academiâ, sive doctores, sive pastores, suo in genere suspiciendos foenum esse oportet? Attamen inquiunt, iniquè iis qui Calvino minus favent, symbolismus cum pontificiis impingitur: quoties enim eos audivimus pro suggestu in Bellar∣minum & Jesuitas involantes? Nescio tamen quonam malo fato accidat, ut cùm in Scismaticos, quos Puritanos indigitant, miseros homines, & omni∣um
eruditorum judiciis explosos invehantur, eos perindè ut Galbam non vis ingenii solùm, sed & animi acris quidam dolor dicentes incendat, effici∣atque ut incitata, & vehemens eorum videatur oratio: contra verò, cùm in pontificios stantes, & erectos, & tantùm non Ecclesiae & Academiae mi∣nantes detonandum esset, omnis motus animi tanquam ventus homines defi∣cit, & planè flaccescit oratio: & Scismatis quidem radici securem injiciunt, haereseos tantùm ramos circumcidunt, seu potiùs sarmenta quae luxuriant amputant. Hic verò eorum non egemus operâ, offerunt se nobis presbyteri, seculares, doctores Sorbonici, & tota Papistarum natio (solos excipio Jesui∣tas) qui technas & versutias Jesuiticas, Romanorum pontificum ambitio∣nem, Caesarum coronis imminentem, & varias curiae Romanae corruptelas multò quam ipsi acriùs insectantur, omnes in hisce argumentis diserti sunt. Quid est hoc aliud, quàm cum capiti mederi debeant reduvias curare? Enim∣verò si Papismi suspitionem seriò à se cogitent amoliri, bonâ fide agant, pon∣tificis in Ecclesiâ principatum, seu potestatem spiritualem, missae sacrificium, crassam praesentiam quam vocant realem, Transubstantiationis monstrum, justitiae inhaerentis perfectionem, bonorum operum meritum, invocatio∣nem Sanctorum, suffragia mortuorum, cultum imaginum, & reliquiarum, deni{que} novum Pii quarti symbolum, & conciliabuli Tridentini decreta non timidè & diffidenter, sed alacriter & fortiter impetant, & valentissimâ rati∣one profligent. Cùm Caecinae milites rebellem quemque in exercitu, noctu, ferro invasissent, truces animos cupido posteà involat, eundi in hostem, pia∣culum furoris: nec aliter placari posse cōmilitonum manes, quam fi pecto∣ribus impiis honesta vulnera accepissent: utinam Deus iis hanc cupidinem inspiraret hostem communem adoriendi, in piaculum furoris: nec enim ali∣ter placari possunt, Calvini, Bezae, Foxii, Anglo-Genevensium, & beatissi∣morum Martyrum manes, quos irritarunt, quam si Ecclesiis reformatis hostium pontificiorum devictorum manubias consecrent. Haec habui, quae in malos pastores, qui aut omninò non pascunt, aut se pascunt, non oves, aut oves pascunt, at non Christi, aut Christi oves pascunt, at non salubri gramine, sed noxiis herbis in hoc tempus dicerem, in quibus si quid mordaciùs videatur, Hieronymi verbis obsecro, ut non tam meae pu∣tetis austeritatis esse quam morbi, putridae carnes ferro curantur, & cauterio, venena serpentina pelluntur antidoto, quod satis dolet, majore dolore expelli∣tur.

SERMONS PREACHED AT PARIS IN THE HOUSE OF THE RIGHT HONOURBLE Sr. THOMAS EDMONDS, LORD EMBASSADOR, RESIDENT IN FRANCE, LYING IN THE FAUXBURGE OF St. GERMANS, IN THE YEERES OF OUR LORD 1610, 1611, 1612.
THE CHECKE OF CONSCIENCE. THE XL. SERMON. ROM. 6.21. What fruit had yet then in those things, whereof yee are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. Right Honourable, right Worshipfull, &c. NO speech of wisdome can be so discrectly uttered, but it may by ignorance be depraved: no action of vertue can be so exactly performed, but it may through ma∣lice be mis-construed. It is not more proper to God to bring light out of darknesse, peace out of trouble, joy out of sorrow, and out of sinne (the greatest of all evils) to extract much good, by governing and disposing it to the declaration of his mercy and justice; than it is natu∣rall to the Divell and his impes, out of the light of truth to endeavour to draw darknesse of errour, and out of the best speeches and actions to straine and force out somewhat, to maintaine and nourish their corrupt humours and bosome sinnes. And what marvell, sith even in Paradise, amidst the sweetest flowers and wholsomest herbes and plants, a Serpent could live, and find there something to feed upon? Paradise was the seat of mans hap∣pinesse, the garden of pleasure, the soyle of the tree of life, seated in the cleerest ayre, watered and environed with sweetest rivers, enamelled with pleasantest flowers, set by God himselfe with the choicest plants, and yet was it not free from the serpent, which turned the juices of those soveraign and medicinall simples into poyson. Aristotle writeth of the Cantharides, that they are killed with the sent of theArist. de mi∣rabil. aus cult. sweetest and most fragrant oynt∣ments:
and it is morally verified in those gracelesse hearers, to whom the Word, which is the2. Cor. 2.16. sweet smelling savour of God to life, becommeth a sa∣vour of death. Such hearers the blessed Apostle Saint Paul sharply censu∣reth in this chapter,Occas. who when hee preached to them salvation by the free grace of Christ, hence concluded free liberty of sinne: when to the comfort of all that are heavie laden with the burden of sinne, he set abroach that hea∣venly doctrine, where sinne abounded, there grace superabounded; they sub∣sumed, Let us therefore continue in sinne, that grace may more abound: whereas indeed they should have inferred the cleane contrary conclusion, thus: Grace hath abounded much more to us; therefore wee of all men should not continue in sinne, because God offereth us so good meanes to escape out of it. The dew of heaven hath fallen plentifully upon us; there∣fore wee ought to be most fruitfull in good workes, not only because God hath better enabled us to doe them, but also in a duty of thankfulnesse wee are to offer him our best service, who hath enriched us with the treasures of his grace. Therefore to beat them, and in them all carnall Gospellers from the former hold, St. Paul in this chapter planteth ordnance of many most forcible arguments, drawne from three principall heads. Analys.1. Christ and his benefits. 2. Themselves and their former condition. 3. The comparison between a sinfull and a holy course of life, and their contrary effects. 1 From Christ and his benefits after this manner: The effect of grace is to mortifie sinne, how then can they who have received a greater measure of grace by the merit of Christs death and buriall, continue in sinne? How can they that are dead to sinne live therein? Whereas they urged grace for liberty of sinne, the Apostle from grace enforceth sanctity of life: whereas they alledged their redemption for their exemption from all service, Saint Paul strongly concludes from so great a benefit, a greater tye and obligati∣on to serve the Lord their Redeemer: whereas they built a fort of sin with the wood of Christs crosse, he maketh an engine of the same wood to over∣throw it: by grace we are united to Christ, and planted in him; therefore we must live the life of the root, & bring forth the fruit of theVer. 5. Ver. 6. spirit: If we have been planted together in the likenesse of his death, wee shall be also in the likenesse of his resurrection, knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sinne might be destroyed, that henceforth wee should not serve sinne, &c. 2 From themselves and their former condition, thus: When yee were free from righteousnesse, yee were servants unto sinne; now therefore being freed from sinne, yee ought to be servants unto righteousnesse: As yeeVer. 18, 19. yeelded your members servants of uncleannesse and iniquity unto iniquity, so now yeeld your members servants of righteousnesse unto holinesse, &c. 3 From the comparison between the state of sin and grace, thus: When you were in the state of sinne, you had no profit at all of your workes, and you were confounded with shame for them, and by them were brought to the very brink of death;Coharent. but now being in the state of grace, you reap fruit
here in holinesse, the fruit of peace and joy, and hereafter you shall reap the fruit of everlasting life and glory. Thus you see the scope of the Apostle, the occasion and coherence of the words, which carry this sense: Tell mee,Exposit. Gen. yee unsettled and unstable Christians, who have been delivered from the thraldome of sinne and Sa∣tan, and have given your names unto Christ, and your members as ser∣vants unto righteousnesse; why goe yee about to enthrall your selves a∣new to your ghostly enemies, or make your selves vassals to your fleshly lusts? Observe yee not the heavie judgements of God lighting daily upon presumptuous sinners? See yee not before your eyes continuall spectacles of Gods justice? and marke yee not in them the fearfull ends of those courses, which now yee begin to take againe, after yee had long left them? Beleeve yee not the words of God,Rom. 2 9. Tribulation and anguish upon every soule that sinneth? for hee willPsal. 68.21. wound the hairy scalpe of every one that goeth on in his wickednesse. Or if you turne away your eyes from beholding the vialls of wrath daily powred upon sinners, and stop your eares, that yee may not heare the dreadfull threats which God thunde∣reth out in his Law against such backsliders and relapsers as yee are: yet can yee stifle your owne hearts griefe? can yee forget the wofull plight into which your former courses brought you, when free from righte∣ousnesse, yee let loose the reines to all licentiousnesse, that yee might worke wickednesse even with greedinesse? yee glutted your selves with earthly vanities, and tooke a surfeit of sinfull pleasures. What gaine did yee not then greedily gape after? what preferment did yee not ambiti∣ously seek? into what mire of impurity did not yee plunge your selves? No sinfull pleasure but yee tooke your fill of, no dish of Satan which yee left untouched; yet speake the truth between God and your owne con∣science, what true delight or solid contentment tooke yee in those things? I know yee are ashamed to speake of it, and I will not wound modest eares to relate it; and ought yee not much more to be ashamed to returne with the dogge to his former vomit, and with the sow to her wallowing in the mire? Your soules have been cleansed by the bloud of your Redeemer from all spots of impurity, will yee againe pollute and soile them? It is folly eagerly to pursue that which will bring you no profit at all; and greater to follow afresh those things whereof ye were not only ashamed in the enjoying them, but also are now confounded at the very mention of them: yet this is not the worst, shame is but the beginning of your woe: For the end is death, yea death without end. Will yee then forsake the waies of Gods Commandements, leading to endlesse felicity, and weary your selves in the by-pathes of wickednesse, in the pursuit of worldly vanities, without hope of gaine, with certaine losse of your good name, nay, of your life? will yee sell heaven for the mucke of the earth? set yee so much by the transitory pleasures of sinne, mixed with much anguish and bitternesse, attended on with shame, that for them yee will be content to be deprived of celestiall joyes, the society of Archangels and Angels, and the fruition of God himselfe for ever? nay, to be cast in∣to the darke and hideous dungeon of hell, to frie in eternall flames, to be companions of ghastly fiends and damned ghosts, howling and shreeking
without ceasing, complaining without hope, lamenting without end, li∣ving, yet without life, dying, yet without death, because living in the torments of everlasting death? Divis. & ex∣plicat. verb.Having taken a generall survey of the whole, let us come to a more par∣ticular handling of the parts, which are three forcible arguments, to deterre all men from all vicious and sinfull courses. 1. The first ab inutili, What fruit had yee? 2. The second ab infami, Whereof yee are now ashamed. 3. The third à pernicioso or mortifero, The end of these things is death. 1. Fruit.What fruit. This word fruit is fruitfull in significations; it is taken: 1 Properly, for the last issue of trees, and so it is opposed to leaves or blossomes: for nature adorneth trees with three sorts of hangings as it were; the first leaves, the second blossomes, the third fruits: in this sense the word is taken in the first of Genesis, and in the parable of the figge-tree cursed by our Saviour, because hee found no fruit thereon. 2 Improperly, either for inward habits, which are the fruits either of the spirit, whereof the Apostle speaketh, TheGal. 5.22. fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith, meeknesse, temperance; or of the flesh, reckoned up by the sameVer. 19, 20. Apostle; or for outward workes, which are the fruits of the former habits: whereof we reade, BeingPhil. 1.11. filled with the fruits of righteousnesse: and in the Epi∣stle of S.Jam. 3.15. James, Full of mercy and good fruits: Or for the reward of these works, either inward, as peace, joy, and contentment; whereof those words of S.Ver. 18. James are to be meant, The fruit of righteousnes is sowne in peace of them that make peace: and those of S. Paul, NoHeb. 12.11. af∣fliction for the time is joyous, but grievous; but in the end it bringeth the quiet fruit of righteousnesse to those that are exercised thereby: Or last∣ly for outward blessings, wherewith God even in this life recom∣penseth those who are fruitfull in good workes, as the Prophet Esay and David assure them: Surely it shall beEsay 3.10. Psal. 58.11. well with the just: for they shall eate the fruits of their workes: Utique est fructus justo; Verily there is fruit for the righteous, verily there is a God that judgeth the earth. 2. Had.Had. It is written of the Lynx, that he never looketh backe; but Ho∣mer contrarily describeth a wise man, . looking both forward and backward, forward to things to come, and backward to things past: for by remembring what is past, and fore-casting things future, he ordereth things present: and in speciall what advantage a Christian maketh of the memory of his former sinnes, and the sad farewell they have left in the conscience, I shall speake more largely hereafter: for the present, in this cursory interpretation of the words it shall suffice to ob∣serve
from the pretertense habuistis, had ye? not habetis, have ye? that sin, like the trees of Sodome, if it beare any fruit at all, yet that it abideth not, but assoone as it is touched falls to ashes. Musonius the Philosopher out of his owne experience teacheth us, and that truely, that if we doe any good thing with paine, the paine is soone over, but the pleasure remaineth; but on the contrarie, if we doe any evill thing with pleasure, the pleasure is soone o∣ver, but the paine remaineth. In those things whereof yee are now ashamed.3. Those things. As after the wound is hea∣led there remaines a scar in the flesh; so after sinne is healed in the conscience, there remaines as it were a scarre of infamie in our good name, and of shame also in the inward man. The act of sinne is transcunt, yet shame the ef∣fect, or rather proper passion of it, is permanent: sinne is more ancient than shame, but shame out liveth sinne. It is as impossible that fire should be without scorching heat, or a blow without paine, or a feaver without shaking, as sinne, especially heinous and grievous, without a trembling in the minde, and shame and confusion in the soule. For, asIn Saturnal. Macrobius well observeth, when the soule hath defiled her selfe with the turpitude of sinne, pudore suffunditur, & sanguinem obtendit pro velamento, she is ashamed of her selfe, and sends forth bloud into the outward parts, and spreadeth t like a vaile before her; just as the Sepia or Cuttle fish, when she is afraid to be taken,Plin. nat hist. l. 9. c. 29. Sepiae ubi sen∣sere se appre∣hendi, offuso atramento quod illis pro sanguine est, absconduntur. sends from her bloud like inke, whereby she so obscureth the water that the angler cannot see her. If it be objected, that some men as they are past grace, so past shame also, and some foreheads of that metall that will receive no tincture of modestie, such as Zeno was inL. 16. Si clam scelera perpe∣trasser, obscu∣rum & minus gloriosum pu∣tabat; sin pub∣licitùs & aper∣tè in conspectu omnium abs{que} pudore flegiti∣osus esset, id dmùm Prin∣cipe & Impe∣ratore dignum putabat. Nicephorus his sto∣ry, who held it a disparagement to himselfe to commit wickednesse in secret, and cover his filthinesse with the darke shadow of the night; for that it be∣came not soveraigne majestie to feare any thing: he thought he could not shew himselfe a Prince, unlesse without feare or shame he committed outrages in the face of the sunne. Such were those Jewes whom the Prophet Jeremie brands in the forehead with the marke of a Strumpet that cannot blush;Jer 8.12. Were they ashamed when they committed abominations? nay,Jer. 3.3. Thou hadst a whores forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed. they were not a∣shamed, neither could they blush. I answer, 1 By distinguishing of shame, which is sometimes taken for the inward affection and irksome passion of a sinner, that hath cast any foule staine up∣on his conscience; sometimes for the outward expression, by dejection in the countenance, faultring in the speech, a cloud in the eye, and flushing in the forehead and cheekes. No sinner is without shame in the first sense, though many by custome in sinne grow senselesse thereof, and consequent∣ly shamelesse in the latter sense; and in the end they come to that height of impudencie, that they blush for it if they blush, and are ashamed of their shamefacednesse, & pudet non esse impudentem. But this hardinesse doth them no good at all; for they doe but stop the mouth of the wound that it bleed not outwardly, it bleedeth inwardly the faster, and much more dangerously. 2 A sinner may be considered either before or after his regeneration; before his regeneration he committeth many sinnes, whereof he is not then ashamed, either because he accounteth them no sins, or not such sinnes as may any wayes trench upon his reputation. For though the dim light of
corrupt nature discovereth some workes of darkenesse, yet not all, nor any in the right hiew. As a man that is in the water feeleth not the weight of it; so the sinner whilest he is in the state of corruption feeleth not the weight of sinne. For he accounteth great sinnes small, and small none at all: but when he is out of that state, then he feeleth the smallest sinne unrepented of as heavie as a talent of lead, able to drowne his soule in eternall perdition; as it followeth: For the endFor the end of these things is death. That is the end of all these things. By end here the Apostle meaneth not the finall cause moving the sinner, but the finall effect of sinne: for the sinner propoundeth to himselfe a divers end; either gaine, which the covetous man shooteth at; or glorie, which the ambitious; or pleasure, which the voluptuous: but they misse their marke, and in stead of gaine, which the covetous man pro∣mised himselfe in his sinfull course of life, in his returne by weeping crosse he findeth irrecoverable losses; (for what fruit had yee?) in stead of glorie and honour, which the ambitious aimeth at, shame and infamie; (whereof yee are now ashamed:) in stead of a pleasant temporall life, which the voluptuous shot at, a painefull and eternall death. For the end of these things Is death.Is death. That is death temporall which is the sinners earnest as it were, and death eternall, which is his full hire and wages; death corporall, which is the separation of the soule from the body, is hastened by sinne; death spirituall, which is the separation of the soule from God, is sinne; and death eternall, in Scripture termed the second death, which is the tormen∣ting of body and soule for ever in the lake of fire and brimstone, is the full reward of sinne; and this death is here principally meant, as may be ga∣thered from the words ensuing my text; but the gift of God is eternall life: for that death which is opposed to eternall life can be no other than e∣ternall death. Obser.The meaning of the text being thus cleared, the speciall points of obser∣vation are easily discerned; the first is, That the smart of the wound of con∣science for sinnes past is a speciall meanes, through grace, to keepe us from sinne to come. Upon this the Apostle worketh in the words of my text, What fruit had yee in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? The burnt child doth not more dread the fire, nor the scholar severely corrected be∣ware the fault for which he smarted, nor the Pilot keep off from the rock at which he formerly dashed his bark, and hazzarded his life and goods, nor the intemperate gallant, tormented with an extreme fit of a burning feaver, for∣beare the pouring in of wine and strong drinkes, which were the oyle that kindled and maintained the flame within his bowels, than he that hath felt the sting of sinne in his conscience, and beene formerly confounded with the shame thereof, dreadeth and flieth, and seeketh by all meanes to shunne those sinnes which have left so sad a remembrance behind them. As some parts of our bodies are more sensible than others, (the sinewie parts more than the fleshly) yet all that have life in them have some sense of paine: so some consciences are more tender, that feele the least pricke of sin; some harder, and more stupid and benummed, like theSolin. c. 29. Matres Urso∣rum diebus primis 14. in omnum ita concidunt, ut ne vulneribus pridem excita∣ti queant. Numidian Beares, which scarce feele stripes or wounds: yet all that have any life of grace in them,
or use of reason, have some touch of conscience at some times, which mar∣reth all their mirth, and overcasteth their faire weather with clouds of griefe, powring downe showres of teares. I know the wicked seeke to dis∣semble it, like the man in Plutarch, who having a foxe under his cloake, ne∣ver quatched, though the beast bit through his sides and devoured his bowels. ThePro. 14.13. foole, saith Solomon, maketh a mocke of sinne, but the heart knoweth the bitternesse of his soule: for even in laughing the heart is sorrow∣full, and the end of that mirth is mourning. I speake not of a melancholy dumpe, but of an habituall and constant pensivenesse, arising from the sting of sinne left in the soule. No tongue can sufficiently expresse it, onely the heart that feeleth it can conceive the nature of this griefe, and smart of this paine which the lash of conscience imprinteth: Juven. sat. 13. Mens habet attonitos, & surdo verbere caedit.Occulto quatiente animum tortore flagello. Yet some sense wee may have of it by the similitudes whereby it is ex∣pressed. It is called aAct. 2.37. pricking of the heart: and lest that wee should ima∣gine it to bee as it were a pricke with a small pinne, or needle, it is called a wound in the heart, (MyPsal. 109.22 heart was wounded within me.) O what paine must a wound in the heart needs be, where the least prick is death? Yet farther, that wee might not thinke this wound might bee drawne together, it is cal∣led the cutting asunder of the heart, (Joel 2.13. Rent your hearts and not your gar∣ments: yet farther, that wee might not thinke any part of the heart to re∣maine entire, it is called thePsal. 51.17. breaking of it into small pieces, andPsal. 22.14. melting these also; and can there bee any sorrow like unto this sorrow, which pricketh the heart, nay woundeth it being pricked, nay rents it being woun∣ded, nay breaketh it being rent, nay melteth it being broken? This prick∣ing, wounding, renting, breaking, melting the heart, is nothing else but re∣morse of conscience for some hainous and grievous sinnes, whereby Gods image in us is defaced, our credit stayned, our profession scandalized, and Gods anger provoked against us. This remorse is found both in the godly, and in the wicked: but in the one it is cured; or at least eased with seasona∣ble comfort; in the other this continuall biting of conscience is without any ease, or hope of cure: and therefore it driveth them to blaspheme God, and curse themselves, & sometimes to lay violent hands upon their own bodies, and apply a remedy worse than the disease. In the godly and penitent it breedeth a loathing and detestation of sinne, and a speedy recourse to the Physitian of their soules, with sighes and groanes that cannot be expressed. For as Lactantius writeth, that the ashes of a burnt viper are a present re∣medy against the sting of the viper, so the remaines of sin in the conscience, viz. remorse and shame, are a present remedy against sinne; as wee may see in David:Psal. 51.3. I know mine owne iniquity, and my sinne is ever before mee:Psal. 38.4, 5. Mine iniquities are gone over my head, they are a burden too heavie for me to beare; my wounds stink and are putrefied through my foolishnesse: and in Solomon, who upon experience of the unfruitfulnesse of sinne indited that ex∣cellent Sermon delivered in the booke of the Preacher; the premisses wherein are,Eccl. 1.2. Vanity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation of spirit: and the conclusion,Eccl. 12.13. Feare God, and keepe his commandements, for this is the whole
man: and in the Jewes, who when Saint Peter set before their eyes their crucifying the Lord of life, their saving a murtherer and murthering their Saviour, wereAct. 2.37. pricked in heart, and said, Men and brethren, what shall wee doe? And in the2 Cor. 7.8, 9. Corinthians, in whom remorse of conscience like the dart of Jason wrought a strange cure, whereat the Apostle much rejoiced: Though I made you sorry, saith hee, with a letter, I repent not. Nay I rejoice, not that yee were sorry, but that yee were sorry to repentance: for godly sorrow causeth repentance to salvation not to bee repented of. For behold this thing that yee have beene godly sorry, what great care it hath wrought in you, yea what clearing of your selves, yea what indignation, yea what feare, yea what zeale; in all things ye have shewed your selves to be pure in this matter. For this cause Saint Paul in his Epistles often rubbeth up their memory to whom hee writeth, with the consideration of their former unregenerate estate: as the Corinthians;1 Cor. 6.9. Know yee not that the unrighteous shall not inherite the King∣dome of heaven? Be not deceived: Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adul∣terers, nor wantons, nor theeves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor extortio∣ners shall inherite the Kingdome of God: and such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are cleansed, but yee are sanctified, but yee are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus. And the Ephesians;Eph. 5.8. Ye were sometimes darknesse, but now yee are light in the Lord:Eph. 4.17, 18, 19. This therefore I testifie unto you, that yee walke not from henceforth as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, having their understanding darkened, and being deprived of the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindnesse of their heart: which being past feeling have given themselves to wantonnesse, to worke all wickednesse with greedinesse. The Angel bid Tobias to unbowell the fish, and take out the gall, as being usefull in medicine and a speciall meanes to recover his eye-sight: The story is Apocryphall, but the application of it is Canonicall, and agreeable to the doctrine of the inspired Scriptures. If wee unbowell wordly pleasures and carnall delights, and take out the gall of them, that is, seriously thinke upon the bitternesse which they leave behind them, it will prove a soveraigne remedy against our spirituall blindnesse. A reason of this observation wee neede not fetch farre; wise men by others fall prevent their owne, but even fooles learne a lesson from their woefull experience:Eras. Chil. Piscator ictus sapit, the fisherman who hastily thrust his hand into his net to take out a fish, and was stung by a Scorpion, was ever after wiser. Remorse of conscience, if no Balme of Gilead bee seasonably appli∣ed to it to asswage the paine, is farre worse than the sting of a Scorpion; which made Cain roare, My punishment is greater than I am able to beare: which forced Judas to hang, and Nero to stab himselfe, Julian the Aposta∣ta to teare his bowels and throw them into the ayre, saying, Vicisti Gali∣laee. The greatest bodily torments that can be devised have beene borne chearfully by many Martyrs; but a troubled spirit, saith the wise man, who can indure?Pro. 11.14. This observation is not more pregnant in the proofe, than poignant in the use, both for tryall and instruction. For if the experience of the unfruit∣fulnesse and shamefulnesse of sinne bee a speciall curbe of sinne in the rege∣nerate; they surely who are not perswaded hereof, who taste no bitternesse in the forbidden fruit, who can thinke of their former sinnes not only with∣out
griefe and remorse, but also with some delight and contentment, were never thoroughly converted. For there can be no vivification without pre∣cedent mortification; no mortification where the old man is yet alive. There is a strugling in the soule in the travell of our new birth between the flesh and the spirit, as there was in the wombe of Rebecca at the time of her la∣bour between Jacob and Esau. Every one, that is renewed in the spirit of his mind,Rom. 7.22, 23. delighteth in the Law of God, as touching the inward man; and therefore cannot approve the law of the members rebelling against the law of the mind. He that truly returneth to God, and placeth his chiefe happi∣nesse in his union with him, cannot but be offended grievously at the re∣membrance of those things that made a separation between him and his God. The weeds that have taken deep root, cannot bee plucked up with∣out stirring the earth. Such are the weeds of sinne rooted in our heart; they cannot be plucked up without tearing and breaking it through contrition. That heart which hath never bin so broken up, was never thorowly weeded. Wherefore (beloved Christians) if ye desire to know whether ye are in the way of life, whether ye are effectually called, whether ye are in the state of grace, whether ye have any part in the promises of salvation; loe here is a touch-stone to try your spirituall estate. When ye recall your for∣mer profanenesse, and uncleannesse, and worldlinesse, and maliciousnesse to mind, is the remembrance of these sinnes grievous unto you? is the bur∣then of them intolerable? are ye pricked in heart with the sting of consci∣ence? doe your eyes melt into penitent teares? then are you quickned by the Spirit of grace, then have you sense and life in you, then have your eyes been annointed with the eye-salve of the spirit, then stand ye recti in curiâ. But on the contrary, Are ye tickled with the remembrance of your former follies? can ye thinke of them without remorse? can ye speake of them without shame? can ye glory in them, and your heart not smite you? then in vaine doe ye flatter your selves with the name of Professours, ye falsly arrogate to your selves the title of Sonnes of God, ye know not what regeneration or the new creature meaneth, the sunne of righteousnesse ne∣ver shone upon you, but ye are still frozen in the dregges of your sinnes. Wherefore examine your owne hearts and consciences, take a view of your whole life past, runne over in your mindes the vanity of your childhood, the lusts of your youth, the audacious attempts of your riper yeeres, and the covetousnesse, frowardnesse, worldlinesse, and distrustfulnesse of your old age: call your selves to an account for your unlawfull gaming and sporting, your immoderate drinking, your Lords day breaking, your la∣scivious dancing, your chambering and wantonnesse; and if the remem∣brance of these your former sinnes be loathsome unto you, if the sent of them in the nostrils of your soule be like a stinking fume exhaled from the finke of originall corruption, then have your senses been purged, then have you smelt the savour of life. But on the contrary, if the cogitation of these things be delightfull unto you, if the traversing these thoughts in your mind blow the coales of your former lusts, if the Sodome of your unrege∣nerate estate seem to you as a Paradise of pleasure, then certainly yee were never redeemed from the corruption of the world, yee never felt the pangs and throes of a new birth, your understanding was never enlightened, nor
your will reformed. Hee that can take delight to play at the hole of the Cockatrice, or behold the shining colour of the Snake, was never stung by them; but the truly regenerate Christian, who hath bin grievously stung by the fiery Serpent the Divell, and by fixing his eyes upon the brazen Serpent Christ Jesus, hath bin cured, dares not come nigh the Serpents hole, much lesse gaze upon his azure head and forked tongue. 2. If the experience of the unfruitfulnesse and shamefulnesse of sinne be a speciall meanes to restraine Gods children from it, certainly the recoun∣ting of their former wayes, and the survey of the whole course of their life, cannot but be a profitable exercise for them. It was the practice of Solomon, who beheld all the workes of his hands, and the delights of his life, and passeth this censure upon them,Eccles. 1.2. Vanity of vanities, all is but vanity and vexation of spirit. It was the practice of David,Psal. 51.3. I know mine owne iniquity, and my sinne is ever before mee. It was the practice of Saint Austine, who a little before his death caused thePossid. in vit. August. Penitentiall Psalmes to be written about his bed, which hee looking upon, out of a bitter remembrance of his sinnes, continually wept, giving not over, long before he gave up the ghost. Mee thinkes, I heare you say, we have buri∣ed those sinnes in oblivion long agoe, and we hope God hath done so: put not these stinking weeds to our noses, but gather us a posie of the sweet flowers of Paradise, the promises of God in Christ Jesus, in which there is a savour of life, and we will smell unto it. I had rather do so, but the other are more proper, and fitter for many of you; for those whose senses are overcome with over-sweet oyntments, can by no better meanes reco∣ver their smell, than by strong and unpleasant savours: and therefore in the country of Arabia, where almost all trees are savoury, and frankincense and myrrhe are common fire wood,Plin. nat. hist. l. 12. c. 17. E Syriâ revehunt Stycacem acri odore ejus in focis abigente suorum fasti∣dium. Styrax (as Pliny writeth) is sold at a deare rate, though it bee a wood of an unpleasant smell; because ex∣perience proveth it to bee a present meanes to recover their smell, who before had lost it. Beloved brethren, we all that have lived in the plea∣sures of sinne, have our senses stuffed and debilitated, if not overcome; and the best remedy against this malady will be the smelling to Styrax, the unsavoury and unpleasing smell of our former corruptions. Let the cove∣tous man recall to mind his care in getting, his anxiety in keeping, his sor∣row in losing that which nature hath put under his feet: how to increase his heapes he hath not onely taken from others, but robbed his owne belly and backe. Let the Glutton thinke of the loathsomnesse of his sinne, which subjecteth him to divers diseases, and maketh him a burthen to himselfe: the Drunkard his drowning of his reason, distempering of his body, and exposing himselfe to the laughter and scorne of all men: the Adulterer the corruption of his owne body, the transgressing the covenant of God, the wronging and provoking his neighbour, the staine of his owne reputation, the rottennesse of his bones, and besides all this, the heavie wrath of God for his sinnes, and feare of hell fire due to him for them. I know no man willingly remembreth that whereof he is ashamed; and therefore no exer∣cise of Christianity more tedious and irksome than this, because it with∣draweth the mind from pleasant and delightfull objects, to behold her own deformity: yet none more necessary, none more profitable. And though it
begins in sorrow, yet it ends in joy: for even this is an exceeding delight to the soule, to find a change in her selfe, and an alteration in her affections: it is pleasant unto her that shee now distasteth the forbidden fruit, and shee rejoyceth that shee can be heartily sorry for her sinnes. And God (asCypr. de card. op. Cy∣prian saith sweetly) wipeth away these teares from the soule, Ut magis plo∣ret, & gaudeat fletibus, that shee may weep the more, and take pleasure in her weeping. For after we have pricked our hearts with the sting of con∣science for our grievous sinnes, after they bleed with compunction, after we have powred out our soules with sighes and groanes into the bosome of our Redeemer, his heart will melt within him, and his repentings will roll together; hee will bind up our wounds, and shew his wounds to his Father: then shall we see the frownes of an angry Judge, turned into the smiles of a loving Father, the crimson colour of our sins into the whitenesse of wooll, our mourning weed into a wedding garment, our sighes and sobs into exultation of spirit, and the fearfull cloud, which before over∣cast our minds, into a cleare skie, into peace of conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost, the true taste and beginning of the joyes of heaven. To which the Lord bring us for his Son Jesus Christ his sake. Cui, &c.
THE VINE OF SODOME. THE XLI. SERMON. ROM. 6.21. What fruit had yee then in those things, &c. Right Honourable, &c. ALL the advised thoughts and purposes of men that are not elevated above the levell of earthly desires to a higher marke than the top of worldly happinesse, fall and fasten themselves upon such things as most neerly concerne either life it selfe, and the commodities or ne∣cessities of life, or their credit and reputation among those with whom they live. These three, life, estate, estimation, are their portion in this life; and therefore the maintenance of them their chiefe care. The world hath nothing besides these to allure and draw on the love of her darlings: for the pleasures that are, spring out of these, and are either their fruits or their blossomes; honour is the pleasure of the ambitious, wealth of the covetous, and the pride of life of all. As for those sensuall delights, which now (I know not how) have engrossed the name of pleasures to themselves, they receive their birth from youth, the spring of our age, their nourishment and maintenance from wealth and pro∣sperity. So that the former limits, within which I have confined the aime and desires of the naturall man, stand sure and immoveable. Of all things in this life, or rather of this life, nothing is so deare and precious as life it selfe: for without it neither honour, nor riches, nor pleasures can bring forth any fruit, because they can have no root; life oftentimes surviveth them, they never survive it. Howbeit, because a miserable and painfull life is a kind of sensible death, and to live and not to be reputed of, is in effect to be repu∣ted not to be, infamy and obscurity being the death of our name, and obli∣vion
the buriall of our best parts: hence it commeth to passe, that the rest∣lesse desires and endeavours of men for riches and honour, especially if they be pricked on forward by covetousnesse and ambition, are not much lesse eager and violent, than is the striving and strugling for life it selfe. The pur∣suit of these is the highest flight of the naturall man: but the regenerate Christian, who is of a nobler breed, soareth farre higher in his desires and affections; the life he pursueth is immortality, the riches hee esteemeth of are celestiall graces, the honour he aspireth unto is a crowne of glory. Now the meanes to attaine the ends of both, viz. temporall happinesse, and happy eternity, the glory of the Kingdomes of the earth, and a King∣dome of glory in heaven, is one and the selfe same, the religious service of the onely true God, in whose gift they are: for1 Tim. 6.6. &c. 4.8. godlinesse is great gaine, and hath the promises of this life, and the life to come: therefore by the law of contraries, ungodly and sinfull courses must needs bee incommodious, and to our greatest losse, as having the curses of this life, and the life to come. Whereby (as by many other things else) we may perceive the folly and blindnesse of the naturall man, who taketh a wrong course to com∣passe his ends: for his way lyeth in the straight pathes of Gods Comman∣dements; but he taketh by-pathes laid out by Sathan, and treadeth endlesse mazes. As theEras. Apoph. Athenians, against whom Diogenes whet his cynick tooth in the feasts of Aesculapius, even when they sacrificed to health, banqueted riotously against health; so the worldly wise man, by inordinately desi∣ring, and craftily pursuing, and immoderately affecting the blessings of this life, loseth them and his life too: for these his desires and pursuits are sinnes, and by sinne all the promises and covenants of God, which are the onely deeds by which wee hold our estate in the blessings of this life, are forfeited. Good God, how doth the god of this world delude the children of the world! whom he perswadeth that the ready way to purchase all the comforts and contentments of this life, is to fall downe and worship him, and to sell themselves with Ahab to worke wickednesse against God: whereas sinne unrepented of, not onely depriveth them of all hope of a better life hereafter, but of all the joy of a good life here. For it consumeth their sub∣stance, it blasteth all the fruits of their labours, it disableth and wasteth their body miserably, troubleth their consciences, staineth their name, and shorteneth the dayes of their life. I feare there are too many in the world, who have no mind of, because no knowledge of spirituall riches and cele∣stiall joyes; yet there is no man in his right senses, who regardeth not ei∣ther his estate, or his credit, or his life here. The ambitious man little esteemeth worldly gaine, because (Chamelion-like) hee feedeth upon the ayre and breath of mens commendations. Againe, the covetous man set∣teth light by praises and honour, because he (like the worme) feedeth upon the earth. The voluptuous man careth not much for honour or wealth, because (like the Beetle) hee feedeth upon the doung of unsavoury plea∣sures; yet there is none of all three but tender their life: and therefore none who can be unsensible of the Apostles incision in my Text. Doth any de∣sire the commodities of this life? let them flye sin: for sin bringeth no fruit at all (What fruit, &c.) Doe any desire glory and honour? they must eschue sinne: for sinne bringeth shame (Whereof yee are now ashamed.) Doe any de∣sire
continuance of life? they must abhorre sinne: for sinne bringeth death; the end of these things is death. Sinne is altogether sterill and unfruitfull, and therefore to be set at nought: it is shamefull, and therefore to bee loa∣thed: it is deadly, and therefore to be fled from as from a Serpent. Here we have three peculiar adjuncts of sinne; sinne is unfruitfull for the time past, shamefull for the present, and deadly for the time to come: the first ad∣junct the unfruitfulnesse of it is so fruitfull of observations, that this houre may be fruitfully spent in gathering them. What fruit had yee? It was the usuall demand of one of the wisest among theCic. in Verr. Romane Judges, Cassius surnamed the Severe, in all cases of doubt, in matter of fact about the person of the delinquent, Cui bono? who gained by the bargaine? on whose side lay the advantage? assuring himselfe, that no man of understanding would put himselfe into any dishonest or dangerous action, without hope of reaping some fruit by it; as also that there can be no enterprise so beset with difficulties and dangers, which some men for apparent hope of great gaine and profit would not goe thorow with: no arguments conclude so necessarily in the opinion of the greater part of men, as those that are drawne abDemost. O∣lynth. 1. . utili. This topick place the Divell made choice of above all other, Haec omnia tibi dabo, in tempting our Saviour: and though this his sharpest dart could not enter into our Saviour, yet it pierceth the heart of most that are meere men, whom when hee cannot ter∣rifie with feares, he setteth upon them argenteis hastis, suggesting after this manner, Haec omnia tibi dabo, thus and thus it shall be with thee: by usury, and oppression, and sacriledge, and cousenage, thou shalt gather much wealth, and become a great man. Wherefore it standeth us much upon to be able to rebate the edge of this sharpe and dangerous weapon of Satan, or to wrest it out of his hands, and fight against himselfe with it, as the Apostle here doth, What fruit had yee? What advantage have you made of sinne? what commeth in by your unjust and ungodly courses? what doe ye gaine by ventring your bodies and soules in Satans bottome? what commodities doe your hellish voyages bring you? If the Apostle had framed his interrogation thus: What pleasure had you in those things whereof yee are now ashamed? they might easily have put it by, saying, No wise man maketh pleasure his summum bonum, or the mark he chiefly aimeth at. If he had shaped it thus, What honour or credit got you by those things whereof yee are now ashamed? a colourable answer might have been, We are not vain-glorious, we build not our fortunes in the ayre upon the breath of other mens mouthes: but when hee thus brandisheth his sword, What fruit had yee in those things? hee toucheth them to the quicke, and enforceth them to answer directly to his interrogatory, or condemne themselves of greatest folly; which imputation of all other, men cannot brooke. It is acutely observed byArist. Ret. l. 1. . Aristotle, who with the same sharp∣nesse of wit pierced into the secrets of nature, and mysteries of policy, that if you deale with a Counceller of state about any motion of his in any pub∣like consultation, and prove unto him, that what he propounded stood not with equity, or the honour of the state (as for example, to take advantage upon the weaknesse of our neighbours and confederates, to bring them un∣der us, though they never offered us any wrong) hee will give you the
hearing, and not vehemently contest with you: but if you goe about to de∣monstrate, that such a proposition of his, if it had taken place, would have proved disadvantageous to the Common-wealth, hee will be at daggers drawing with you, and never bee brought to yeeld to you in that point. Whereupon he inferreth, that howsoever justice, honesty, the dignity and honour of the Common-wealth are things to be thought upon, and serve for ornaments of speech, and motives to some few, yet that which turneth the ballance, and carrieth the greatest sway in all politicke consultations, is matter of profit and emolument, which hee there determineth to be the end of all deliberations. And though Tully in his booksCic. de lib 7. de oratore disliketh Aristotles opinion herein, alledging against it the practice of the Romane state, which (as he there would beare us in hand) ever stood more upon no∣bler termes of their honour and soveraignty, than upon baser respects of gaine and profit; yet when he grew elder, and experience better instructed him, in his booke of partitions he concurreth with Aristotle in judgement, and the Lacedaemonians in practice, who though they were otherwise com∣mended for their upright dealing, and harmlesse carriage, yet were noted alwaies to wave the point of honesty, ubi de commodis Reipublicae ageretur, when the commodity of the Common-wealth was interessed therein. That Maxime of the Parthians, Nulla fides nisi prout expedit, no faith (or keep∣ing touch with any) but as it maketh for advantage, is not more abhorred by Statesmen in their words, and confuted in their discourses, than exem∣plified by them in their actions. Wherefore, sith the consideration of profit and emolument is of so great importance in all affaires and passages of life, let us see whether the vines of Sodome, or the trees of Paradise are more fruitfull; or rather whether sin be not altogether unfruitfull. For if it appeare so, then hath the worldly man no cover or shelter for his sinne; and that it is so, appeareth not only by this interrogatory of the Apostle, and the paralleld Text thereunto,Ephes. 5.11. have no fellowship with the unfruitfull workes of darknesse, but reprove them ra∣ther: but also by the most usuall names of sinne in Scripture, 1. Folly. 2. Vanity. 3. A Lye. 1. Sinne is called folly, because the sinner is very witty in inventing sleights to deceive himselfe withall, cunning and secret in spreading a net, and laying a snare to catch his owne soule in: hee taketh great paines, and keepeth much adoe to undoe himselfe, and can there bee greater folly than this? As the wisedome of God made knowne by the preaching of the Gospel seemeth foolishnesse to the worldly man; so it is most true, that the wisedome of this world is folly with God, and often called by that name in the Proverbes and Ecclesiastes. 2. As sinne is called folly, so it is called alsoPsal. 14.1. & Pro. 7.22. & 11.29. & 12.15. & 19.1. &c. vanity: for sinne is vain, be∣cause empty of all goodnesse, because it hath nothing in it, because the pro∣jects and enterprises of the sinner take no effect, or not such as he promi∣sed himselfe.
3 In the same respect all sinnes in generall are tearmed lyes: because they promise and make shew of great gaine, comfort, and contentment to be rea∣ped by them; whereas they bring nothing lesse, but are like the deceitfull ground in the Poet that mocketh the husbandman: Virg. Geor. 1.Expectata seges vanis elusit avenis. This reason SaintL. 14. de Civ. Dei, c 4. Bea∣tus vult ess, e∣tiam non sic vive ido ut possit esse: quid est hac volun∣tate mendaci∣us? unde non frustra dici po∣test omne pec∣catum esse mendacium: non enim sit peccatum nisi eà voluntate quâ volumus ut bene sit no∣bis, vel nolu∣mus ut malè; ergô mendaci∣um est, quòd cum fiat ut be∣nè sit nobis, hinc potiùs male est nobis: vel cum fiat ut meliùs sit no∣bis, hinc poti∣ùs pejùs est no∣bis. Austine was well pleased with, as appeareth by his of∣ten running upon it: They would, saith hee, bee blessed who take a course to hinder themselves from blessednesse, or deprive themselves of it: in which re∣gard all sinne may bee called a lye, because no man committeth sinne but out of a desire to doe good to himselfe, whereas indeed by his sinne hee hurteth and en∣dammageth himselfe. I finde three Emblemes in holy Scripture, whereby this truth is represented to the eye. The first is, Psal. 12.8. Impii ambulant in circuitu, the wicked walke in a circle, or a ring; which the Holy Ghost affirmeth of them, not so much be∣cause they often traverse the same thoughts, and tread a kind of maze in their mindes, as because their labours and travels prove in the end fruitlesse and unprofitable. For in a circle, though wee runne never so fast, wee gaine no ground, but the faster wee goe forward the nearer we come to the same point we set out at: as we see the labouring horse or oxe in the mill travel∣leth all the day long, and wearieth it selfe, yet at night it is in the same place where it was in the morning; so the wicked spendeth his strength, and run∣neth himselfe out of breath in the wayes of vanity, and yet maketh no pro∣gresse at all. The second Embleme is a Spider weaving a curious web, or a foolish man hatching the egges of a Cockatrice:Esa. 59.4, 5, 6 They trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischiefe, and bring forth iniquity. They weave the Spiders web, and hatch the Cockatrice egges: he that eateth of their egges dyeth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a Viper. Their webbes shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their workes: their workes are workes of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. A third wee have drawne by the ProphetHos. 8.7. Hosea; a man going about to sow the winde: They have sowne the winde, and they shall reape the whirlewind: it hath no stalke; the bud shall yeeld no meale. Desire you yet a fourth? you shall finde it in the ProphetEsa. 29.8. Esay; a man dreaming of great feasts and riotous banqueting all night long, and in the morning finding his belly lanke, and his stomacke empty: Hee shall bee as when a hungry man dreameth, and behold hee eateth; but hee awaketh and his soule is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and behold hee drinketh; but hee awaketh, and behold hee is faint, and his soule longeth for drinke. Now although where wee have divine authority and humane experience for any truth, wee need not crave ayde from reason: yet to furnish you with all sorts of arguments against this most common, yet most dange∣rous temptation of Satan, whereby hee deludeth most men, perswading them that the ready way to thrive is to enlarge their consciences, and take fraudulent, violent, or unjust courses; I will propose some arguments now, and more hereafter, to demonstrate sinne to bee altogether unfruitfull, all
things being reckoned together. For if the pretended commodities accrew∣ing by sinne no way countervaile the certaine losses growing from it, it can∣not bee denied that sinfull courses are unprofitable and disadvantageous. What then is that which may bee gained by sinne, if any thing may bee got by it? Earthly commodities, houses, grounds, money, plate, stuffe, and the like. But what loseth the sinner by it? Heaven, and the glory of an im∣marcessible garland: so that as Demades sometime spake to the Athenians,Eras. Apoph. Cavete ne dum de coelo contendatis, terram amittatis; Take heed lest while yee strive about the heaven or situation, you lose your land; we may thus invert, ca∣vete ne dum de terrâ contendatis, coelum amittatis, taketh heed lest while ye strive for earth, ye lose heaven. What losse can be comparable to this, except the losse of our own soules, which commeth by sin also, andMar. 8.36. what profiteth it a man to gain the whole world, and lose his own soule? or what shall he receive in recompence for his soule? without which he is made uncapable of receiving any thing at all. What good can melodious musicke, or sweet oyntment, or banqueting dishes, or costly jewels doe to a carkasse? and what are wee else when wee have lost our soules? Dearely beloved Christians, thinke of these words of our Saviour when the Divell openeth his packe, and setteth out his counterfeit wares before you, crying, O come hither, what lacke yee? buy of mee honours, and pleasures, and lands, and possessions, and gardens of delight, and stately palaces, and rich furniture, and what heart can de∣sire; Alas, what will it advantage you to gaine these things, and lose your soule? what joy, delight, or comfort can these things bring to you when your soule is gone, that is, when you are not? Moreover, consider what are these wares whereof Sathan maketh such ostentation, gilding them over with the names of honours, riches, and pleasures: no other than such as you see in some Haberdashers shop, feathers and glasses, things of small value, lesse use, and no continuance; and yet so impudent is hee, that hee is not asha∣med to aske for these trifles, for these crepundia, these Tricae, apinaeque, aut si quid vilius istis, all the jewels and spirituall graces which enrich the soule, nay a crowne of glory in heaven, nay your very soule: and yet he wanteth not Chapmen, nay, which all the teares that misery and compassion ever shed are not sufficient to be waile, men throng, and presse, and strive who shall make the first bar∣gaine with him. I forbeare to number reasons, and deliver you arguments as it were by tale. I beseech you weigh these which I have brought, in the scales of the Sanctuary, and grieve not from henceforth though wicked men becomePsal. 49.16, 17. rich, and the glory of their house bee encreased; for they shall carry nothing a∣way with them when they dye, neither shall their pompe follow them: they shall carry nothing with them, but they shall be carried by evill Angels to the dungeon of hell; neither shall their pompe follow them, but shall rather goe before them to the place of mourning, shricking, and endlesse disconsolati∣on. Stoope not, O stoope not to take up those golden apples, which Satan casteth before you in your holy race, to stay your course, and deprive you of your garland: for either they have but a shew of fruit, and are not apples
indeed; or if they are true apples, sinne beareth them not: for God hath cursed the forbidden tree, as Christ did theMat. 21.19. figge-tree in the Gospell, say∣ing, Let no man gather fruit of thee for ever. What fruit had ye? Propound unto your selves (Beloved) often this question of the Apostle, and the other of our Saviour, What will it advantage a man to win the whole world, and to lose his owne soule? that yee may be ready with an answer when the Devill assaulteth you, as hee did our Saviour, with an Om∣nia dabo,Mat. 4.9. All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship me, Avoid Sathan father of lies; thou give all these things! neither doest thou give any thing, but sellest at the dearest rate; neither are those things thou offerest in thy hands, but in Gods; neither are they to bee gotten by worshipping thee, but by serving him: for thus it is written,Psal. 25.13. He that feareth the Lord, his soule shall dwell at ease, and his seed shall inherite the earth.Psal. 128.1, 2, 3. Blessed is hee that feareth the Lord, and walketh in his wayes; for hee shall eate the la∣bour of his hands, and happy shall hee bee: his wife shall bee as the fruitfull vine by the walls of his house, his children shall bee like Olive branches round about his table:1 Tim. 4.8. and, godlinesse hath the promises of this life, and the life to come. Howbeit a weake Christian may bee troubled in minde, when hee seeth houses full of the treasures of wickednesse, and hee heareth it as a common Proverbe, that fawning and cosenage are the gainfullest trades in the world: Juven. sat. 1.Criminibus debent hortos, praetoria, mensas. The Courtier is indebted to his flattery for his large revenues, the Citizen to usury and misery for the swelling of his bagges, the Artisan to his fraud and cozening for his wealth, the Impropriator to his sacriledge for his best mannors and palaces, the ambitious Diotrephes to simony for his dignities and preferments. Notwithstanding these and many the like in∣stances may bee brought against the doctrine delivered, yet is not the truth thereof impeached. For either the great gainer by sin, and bargainer with Sa∣tan shall never live to enjoy his wealth; which the Prophet David observeth, saying,Psal. 37.1.2, 10, & Psal. 73.18, 19. Fret not at the ungodly, neither bee thou envious at the evill doers; for they shall bee cut downe as the grasse, and wither as the greene herbe: O how suddenly doe they consume, perish, and come to a fearefull end? Or if like fortunate Pyrats they live long, and goe cleare away with the prize they have gotten, yet they can take no quiet contentment therein, because they know they have no right to it; and therefore they are still in feare ei∣ther of losing it, or paying too deare for it. And howsoever they may es∣cape while they are at the sea, yet when they arrive at the haven of death, they shall make shipwracke of it and their soules. Or God bloweth upon the fruits of their labors, and blasteth the increase of their wealth; according to the words of St.Jam. 5.2. James, Your riches are cor∣rupt, your garments are moth-eaten, your gold and silver are cankered, and the rust of them shall bee as a witnesse against you, and eate your flesh as it were fire. And as they got their goods, so they shall lose them;Eras. Chil. Salis onus unde ve∣nerat illuc abit, saith the Latine Proverb, the burden of salt is returned thither
from whence it was first taken. The occasion wherof was a ship laden with salt by a wracke torne in pieces, let the salt fall into the sea from whence it came: so for the most part goods gotten by the spoyle, are lost likewise by the spoyle. For wee see daily that they which spoile others are spoiled them∣selves, and that which is gotten by extortion, is extorted againe out of the hand of the extortioners.Suet. in Vesp. Vespasian his covetous officers that by ra∣pine and exaction filled themselves like spunges, after they were full were squiezed by the Emperour: and as the ProphetMic. 1.7. Micah observeth, that which was gathered by the hire of a whore, returneth to the wages of an harlot. Or if their goods and honours sticke by them, and they have wrought themselves into so great favour with the Prince, that they have no feare at all of being called to an accompt, much lesse of being discomposed and turned out of their offices, honours, wealth and all, yet they can take no comfort in their estate, no joy in that they enjoy. For what doth musicke delight him who hath an aposteme in his eare? or gold, silver, or pretious stones him who hath a pearle in his eye? or daintie dishes him whose taste is di∣stempered with sicknesse? This is the worldlings case, hee hath goods laid up for him many yeeres; but they are not goods to him, because they doe him no good; hee is no whit the better for them, but the worse; no whit the richer in mind, but the more wretched and poorer: Magnas inter opes inops. Hee may take his fill of pleasures, but they are no pleasures to him, because hee hath no sense of them: all dainties are provided for him, but they are not dainties to him, because hee cannot taste them; and the reason is, hee is heart sicke with cares and griefes, and affrighted with terrours of consci∣ence. Yea, but it will bee objected, that no such thing appeares: for none seeme so merry and frolicke as some of these albae galinae filii, the worlds dar∣lings. I answer with Saint2 Cor. 5.12. Paul, That they laugh in the face, but not in the heart: and with Solomon,Eccl. 7.6. That all their mirth is but like the crackling of thornes under a pot, soone turned into ashes and mourning. Their merriment is like to that of those who have eaten the herbe Sardonia in Sardinia, who are said toSolin. c. 12. Sardonia herba comesta ri∣ctu ora didu∣cit, ut morien∣tes ridentium facie intereant. dye laughing: or like that of Hannibal, which the Historian cal∣leth amentis risum, the laughing of a man distracted, which is suddenly ac∣companied with teares. Lastly, adde we to all these disadvantages, the price wee are to pay for Satans commodities in the prison of hell, whereof oneMat. 5.26. Thou shalt not goe thence till thou hast paid the utmost far∣thing. farthing shall not bee abated: and I doubt not but as the Prophet Daniel spake of King Nebuchadnezzars dreame,Dan. 4 19. This dreame bee to the Kings e∣nemies; so ye will all say, the gain that is gotten by evill meanes and ungod∣ly practices bee unto Gods enemies; let them trucke with Satan who have no part in God: but let all that desire to thrive both in their outward and inward estate, and to beMat. 6.19. rich in God, follow the advice of our Saviour, Lay not up for your selves treasures, especially treasures of wickednesse, upon earth, where the canker of covetousnesse corrupteth, and the moth of envie fret∣teth, and restlesse cares, and watchfull feares like theeves in the night breake
through the walls of your body, and enter into the closet of your heart, and steale away all your joy and contentment; but lay up for your selves treasures in heaven, where neither the moth nor canker corrupt, and where theeves do not breake through nor steale. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be. Our treasure (O Lord) is in heaven, even in thee, let our heart be there conti∣nually with thee. Cui, &c.
THE GRAPES OF GOMORRAH. THE XLII. SERMON. ROM. 6.21. What fruit bad yee in those things, &c. Right Honourable, &c. SOlinusCap. 35. Praecipua ficus Aegyptia po∣ma non ramis tantum gesti∣tans, sed & caudice septies anno fert fru∣ctum, &c. writeth of the Egyptian figge-tree, that it beareth fruit not only on the branches, but also on the main stock & trunck; so fruitfull is this parcell of Scrip∣ture, on which my meditations have pitched and rested themselves these three Lords dayes: it beareth fruit, and that in great variety, not only upon the branches, but upon the maine stocke▪ which yeeldeth us this fruit∣full observation, That the sense and taste of the bitter∣nesse of sinnes past, and remorse of conscience for them, are most forcible motives and meanes to restraine the desires, and weane the affections of Gods children from them. This fruit we gathered heretofore, and since plucked to us the first branch of the Text, which affordeth this most whol∣some observation. That sinne is altogether unfruitfull. As no meditation is more serious, than upon the vanity of the world; no contemplation more pleasant to a regenerate Christian, than of the unpleasantnesse of impure delights: so no observation is more fruitfull, than of the unfruitfulnesse of sinne. Who cannot copiously declaime against sinne, against which it is a sinne not to declaime? Who cannot easily recount all the evils which sinne hath brought into the world, which are summarily all that are in the world? insomuch that all sciences, arts, and professions have a blow at sinne. The Metaphysicke Philosopher demonstrateth, that sinne is non ens, naught: and therefore to be set at naught. The Naturalist sheweth that it destroyeth nature: and therefore ought to be exterminated out of nature.
The Moralists muster all the forces of vertue against it, as being the chie∣fest enemy of mans chiefe good, which they define to be actio virtutis in vitâ perfectâ, the continuall practice of vertue in a happy life. The Physi∣cians observe, that the greater part of the diseases of the body arise from sins, which are the diseases of the soule: Plures gulâ, quàm gladio, more come to their end by gluttony, drunkennesse, and incontinency, than by the halter or the sword. The Grammarians condemne sinne as incongru∣ous; the Logicians as illogicall, that is, unreasonable; and all other arts and sciences as irregular: but Divinity alone knocketh it downe and battereth it to pieces with the hammer of the Word. There is more weight of argument in this one Verse of the Apostle, than in all the Oratours declamations, and Poets satyres, and the Philosophers invectives against vice that ever were published to the world. What fruit had yee in those things whereof yee are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. As the same metall running upon divers moulds is cast into divers formes; so the words of this Text admit of divers divisi∣ons, according to severall moulds and frames of art. It shall suffice to give you your choice of three. 1. The Rhetoricall, which breaketh them into 1. A poignant interrogation, What fruit had yee? 2. A forcible reason, For the end of those things is death. 2. The Logicall, which observeth in them 1. The persons, Yee. 2. The object, Those things. 3. The attributes: which are three, 1. Losse, What fruit had yee? 2. Confusion, Whereof yee are now ashamed. 3. Perill, For the end of those things is death. 3. The Theologicall, which considereth sinne in a three-fold relation, 1. To the time past; and so it is unfruitfull: What fruit. 2. To the time present; and so it is shamefull: Whereof, &c. 3. To the time to come; and so it is dreadfull or deadly: For the end of those things is death. First of sinne, considered in a relation to the time past. What fruit had yee? Xerxes (as Herodotus reporteth) bare a strange af∣fection to the Plane tree, which hee hung about with chaines, and deckt with jewells of greatest price. A fond and foolish affection, as being to a tree, and such a tree as is good for nothing but to shade us out of the Sunne. This folly of so great a Monarch very well resembleth the humour of all those, who are not guided by the Spirit of God into the wayes of truth and life, but are led by the spirit of errour, or the errour of their owne spi∣rit, to ungodly and sinfull courses, the very beaten paths to hell and death.
The tree they are in love with, adorne, and spend so much cost upon, is the forbidden tree of sinne, altogether as unfruitfull as that of Xerxes; it hath neither faire blossomes, nor sweet fruit on it, onely it is well growne, and hath large armes and broad boughes, and casteth a good shade, or to speake more properly, a shadow of good. For the shade it selfe of this tree is like the shade of the Cyprus tree, gravis umbra, a noysome or pestilent shade, making the ground barren, and killing the best plants of vertues, by depriving them of the Sun-shine of Gods grace. Yet, as divers Nations in the dayes ofNat. hist. l. 12. Tributum & pro umbrâ pendunt. Pliny paid tribute to the Romanes for the shade of these trees; so doe these men pay for the seeming pleasure and delight of sinne, being indeed but a shadow of vanity to the Divell, the greatest tribute that can be payd, the tribute of their soules. To reprove this folly to bee bewailed with bloudy teares, I have heretofore produced divers passages of holy Scripture: the point of doctrine I beat upon, and laboured especi∣ally to fasten in your hearts, was the unprofitablenesse and the unfruitfulnesse of sinne: which was proved 1. By the three names of sinne imposed by the Holy Ghost, folly, vani∣tie, and a lye. The reason whereof was, because all sinne maketh a shew of, and (as it were) promiseth to the sinner either pleasure, or profit, or ho∣nour, or some good; whereas indeed it bringeth not any thing to him but shame, nor him to any thing but death. 2. By divers lively comparisons and resemblances in holy Scripture of sinfull labours and travells, as the running in a ring or circle, whereby hee that moveth and tireth himselfe, getteth no ground; impii ambulant in cir∣cuitu: the weaving of the Spiders web, which maketh no garment: the sow∣ing of wind, whereof nothing can be reaped but the whirlewind, stormes, and tempests of conscience. 3. By the judgements of God falling upon them, who seem to drive the most gainfull trade with Sathan. For either they themselves are taken a∣way in the midst of their prosperity, and as soone as they have gotten the wealth of the world, are constrained to leave a world of wealth;Luk. 12.20. O foole, this night they shall take away thy soule. Stulte, hac nocte eripient tibi animam tuam: or God bloweth upon their ill gotten goods, and they are suddenly consumed, or passe the same way that they came; as the fogges that are raised by the Sunne, when they come to their height, are dispelled by his beames: Or they prove like the horse of Seja∣nus, or the gold of Tolous, or the vessels and treasures of the Temple at Jerusalem, which became the bane and ruine of all that laid hands on them: Or if they long enjoy their wealth, yet they joy not in it at all. For how∣soever none lay claime to their unrighteous Mammon, yet they can never perswade themselves that it is their owne; and between care of keeping, and feare of losing, and expectation of punishment for ill getting them, by ty∣ranny, exaction, oppression, forged cavillation, fraud, simony, or sacri∣ledge, no place is left for any joy or comfort in possessing, or well using them. 4. By putting the seeming profits and advantages of sinne in one scale, and the losses and disadvantages by it in the other: which being done, the scale of dammages and losses will beare downe to the ground, nay to hell. In all bargaines we are to consider not so much what the commodity is we
trade or trafficke for, as what the price is: for though the merchandize we bargaine for be of great value, yet if we must over-buy it, giving for it an unreasonable rate, the bargaine cannot be good. By which rule, if we ex∣amine our trafficke, we shall find, that if wee hold on our trade with Sa∣than, our merchandize will no way countervaile our charge, our gaines in the beginning will be no way answerable to our losses in the end: for we shall lose the inheritance of a Kingdome in heaven, and our owne soules. Unfruitfulnesse, shamefulnesse, and deadlinesse are three proper adjuncts, and (as the Logicians usually speake) passions of sinne. For all sinne is mor∣tall, that is, deserving death; and nothing is mortall in that sense but sinne: all sinne is shamefull, and nothing shamefull but sinne: all sinne is unfruit∣full, and nothing absolutely is unfruitfull but sinne. The Serpents feed upon, and consume that poysonous matter, which otherwise would infect the earth, water, and ayre. Physicians make treakle and antidotes of poy∣son: the ashes of a Viper, the oyle of a Scorpion, the wings of the Cantha∣rides, are soveraigne remedies against the poyson of those Serpents: yea, the very doung of the earth serveth for very good use, and fatteneth the ground; onely sinne, as it is deprived of the good of being a nature, so it depriveth nature of all good. If any things come neere to sinne in this, they are the grapes of Gomorrah, and apples of Sodome, which have no taste at all in them, but as soone as they are touched fall to dust; and the dust is of that nature, that it serves not as doung to fatten the earth, but rather as un∣savoury salt, which maketh it barren. All the endeavours & operations of nature, when they are not set out of their course by sinne, forcibly tend to some good, and obtaine it also. For if they produce not, and leave behind them some worke, the worth whereof may recompence the labour about it; yet the very contention and exercise of the faculty breedeth a dexterity and facility of doing the like: it perfecteth the skill, strengtheneth the fa∣culty, accommodateth the organ, and thereby maketh the whole body more serviceable to the soule, and the soule better disposed to vertuous acts and habits. The Archer, who often misseth the marke set before his eyes, yet in some sort hitteth the marke he aimed at in his mind, which was the exercise of his arme, and learning to shoot. As the sons of the husbandman in the fable, who being told by their father lying on his death-bed, that he left much gold buried under the ground in his Vineyard, fell on delving and digging all about the Vines; and though they found no gold, yet by stirring the mold about the rootes of the trees, gained a great vintage that yeere: even so it falleth out in the labours and travells of our calling; though by them wee reape not alwayes that profit we expect, yet thereby wee may manure (if I may so speake) the ground of our hearts, and gaine great store of those fruits, which the branches that are graffed into the true Vine Christ Jesus, beare. But in sinfull labours and travells it fareth otherwise; they are not as moderate exercises which strengthen, but as violent fits which weaken nature. Sinne in the understanding darkeneth the thoughts, in the will depraveth the desires, in the sensitive appetite disordereth the affections, in the outward sense corrupteth the organs, and in the whole bo∣dy breedeth loathsome and painfull diseases. Sinne is not only unfruitfull, (to speake in the language of the Schooles) formaliter, but also effectivè;
not only unfruitfull in it selfe, as theMat. 21.19. figge-tree in the Gospel cursed by our Saviour, but also in its effects, as that other tree which was to be plucked up, ne terram redderet infructuo sam, that it might not make the groundLuke 13.7. bar∣ren. For sinne maketh the spirit barren of the fruit of good motions, the understanding barren of the fruit of good meditations, the will barren of the fruit of good resolutions, the sensitive appetite barren of the fruit of good affections, the whole man barren of the fruit of good works: nay, the earth and trees also barren of their fruit and increase. For the sinne of man God cursed the earth, and itGen. 3.18. brought forth thornes and thistles; and the hea∣ven and skie also, and it became asDeut. 28.23. iron over mens heads: the experience whereof brought the Heathen to acknowledge this truth, Senec. in Oe∣dip.Sperare poteras sceleribus tantis Dare regnum salubre, Fecimus coelum nocens. Our sinnes have tainted the influence of the starres, dryed up the clouds, in∣fected the ayre, blasted the fruits of the earth. And Claudian in his investive against Eutropius, —Quae connubia prolem Aut frugem laturus ager? quid fertile terris, Aut plenum stirili possit sub consule nasci? Is it possible any thing should thrive or flourish under the shade of such a Consul? SaintAdvers. De∣met. Quereris quod minus nunc tibi ube∣res, fontes, & aurae salubres, & frequens pluvia, & ferti∣lis terra obse∣quium, praebe∣ant, quod non ita utilitatibus & voluptatibus tuis elementa deserviant: Tu enim Deo ser∣vis, per quem tibi cuncta de∣serviunt? Tu famularis illi, cujus nutu tibi unviersa famu∣lantur? Cyprian also attributeth the great dearth in his time to the want of charity; and the sterility of fruits in the earth, to the sterility of fruits of righteousnesse: Thou complainest that the springs are not so full, the ayre so healthy, the showers so frequent, the earth so fruitfull, as in former time: thou thinkest much that the elements are not so obsequious to thee as they have been, that they serve not thy profit and pleasure: Why? art thou so obsequi∣ous to God? Doest thou serve him, by whose appointment all these things serve thee? As it was the manner of the Persians, when a noble person commit∣ted a fault, to beat his clothes in stead of him; so it pleaseth our most in∣dulgent Father, when the noblest of his creatures, men his children offend, often for them to punish the beasts of the field, and fruits of the earth, which feed and clothe them. As he threatneth,Deut. 28.38, 39, 40. Thou shalt carry out much seed into the field, and shalt gather but little: for the Locusts shall consume it. Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dresse them, but shalt neither drinke of the wine, nor gather the grapes: for the worme shall eate them. Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not annoint thy selfe with the oyle: for thine olive shall cast his fruit. Hereunto if we adde the in∣finite armies of plagues and judgements mustered in this chapter against Gods enemies, we cannot but subscribe to the Prophets conclusion, Non est pax impio, there is noEsay 48.22. & 57.21. peace to the wicked, saith my God: there is no fruit of sinne; for it is the vine ofDeut. 32.32, 33. Sodome, and of the fields of Gomorrah: the grapes thereof are the grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter. Their wine is the poyson of Dragons, and the cruell venome of Aspes. Would yee know all the miseries that sinne hath brought into the
world? reckon then all that are, or ever were in the world. For they are all concomitants, effects, or punishments of sinne. Sinne cast the An∣gels from Heaven into Hell, thrust man out of Paradise, drowned the old world, burnt Sodome and Gomorrah with fire and brimstone, rui∣nated the greatest Monarchies, destroyed the ancientest Cities, and hath rooted up the most flourishing Churches; and shall wee looke for bet∣ter fruit of it? But this interrogatory of the Apostle, What fruit had yee? seemeth to mee rather to aime at the particular endammagement and detriments of sinne, which every soule that committeth it sustaineth within it selfe, whereof many have been already recounted, yet the greater part is be∣hind, among whom this is not the least, that it blindeth the eyes of the mind, and infatuateth the sinner. Whereupon Saint Austines observa∣tion is, If a theefe or fellon should presently upon his fact lose the sight of his eyes, every body would say, that it was the judgement of God upon him. Ocu∣lum cordis amisit, & ei pepercisse putatur Deus: behold God hath taken a∣way the sight of his soules eyes, and doest thou thinke that hee spareth him, or letteth him goeCic. de A∣rusp. respons. Oculorum cae∣citas ad men∣tem translata est. unpunished? What greater losse to a noble mind than of libertie, which is forfeited by sinne? Sinne enthralleth our soule to our body, and our body and soule to the Divell. If captivitie of the body be so grievous a calamity, what may wee judge of the captivi∣tie of the soule? If wee so disdaine to be slaves to men, how much more should wee to bee vassals to beastly lusts? To speake nothing of peace of conscience, which crying sinnes disturbe; and divine motions, which worldly cares choake; and heavenly comforts, which earthly pleasures deprive us of; and sanctifying graces, which impure thoughts and sin∣full desires diminish: to leave the consideration of shame and death for matter of ensuing discourses; by that which hath been already delivered, all that are not besotted by sin, and blind-folded by Sathan, may see great reason for this question of the Apostle, What fruit had yee? A question which the proudest and most scornfull sinners, who have them in deri∣sion that make conscience of unlawfull gaine, shall propound unto them∣selves one day, and checke their owne folly therewith, as we reade in the booke ofWisd. 5.8. Wisedome: What hath pride availed us? or what profit hath the pompe of riches brought us? Then shall they change their mindes, when they cannot their estates, and sigh for griefe of heart, and say within themselves, looking up to Heaven, and seeing the felicity of the righte∣ous crowned with eternall glory:Ibid. Ver. 4, 5, 6, 7. This is hee whom wee sometimes had in derision, and in a parable of reproach. Wee fooles thought his life madnesse, and his end without honour. But now how is hee accounted among the chil∣dren of God? and what a portion hath hee among the Saints? Therefore wee have erred from the way of truth: and the light of righteousnesse hath not shi∣ned upon us. We have wearied our selves in the wayes of wickednesse, and have gone through many dangerous pathes: and the way of the Lord wee have not knowne. Howbeit, two sorts of men in the opinion of the world seeme to make great gaine of sinne; the covetous and the ambitious: the former is in∣debted to his extortion, oppression, and usury for his wealth; the other
to his glozing, dissembling, undermining, perfidious and treacherous dealing for his honour, and advancement in the Court of Princes. The spirit of the former hath been conjured downe heretofore, by proving that whosoever gathereth wealth or mony by unjust and indirect meanes, putteth it into a broken bagge, and that his mony shall perish with him, unlesse hee breake off his sinne by repentance, and make friends of unrighteous Mammon. I come to the Politicians, who cor∣rect, or rather pervert that sentence of Saint Paul, Godlinesse is great gaine, thus; a shew of godlinesse is great gaine: of whom I would demand what shew of reason they have for this their politicke apho∣risme? If they beleeve there is a God that judgeth the earth, they cannot but thinke that hee will take most grievous vengeance on such as goe about to roote out the feare of God out of mens hearts, and make Religion a masque, and God himselfe an Image, the sacred Story a fa∣ble, Hell a bug-beare, and the joyes of Heaven pleasant phantasies. If men hold them in greatest detestation who faulter and double with them, shall not God much more hate the hypocrite, who doubleth with his Maker, maketh shew of honouring and serving him, when hee indeed neither honoureth nor serveth him at all: Simulata sancti∣tas est duplex iniquitas, counterfeit sanctity is double iniquity, and accordingly it shall receive double punishment. When our Saviour threateneth the most hainous transgressours, that they shall have theirMat. 24.51. portion with hypocrites, hee implyeth that the condition of none in Hell is lesse tolerable than of the hypocrite. ThePsal. 14.1. foole hath said in his heart there is no God, and even in that hee shewed himselfe the more foole, in that hee said it in his heart, supposing that none should heare it there: whereas God heareth the word in the heart, before it bee uttered in the tongue; and what though other know it not, sith hee whom hee wrongeth, who is best able to revenge it, know∣eth it? But to wound the Politician with his owne sword: If a shew and appearance of Religion is not onely profitable, but necessary in po∣liticke respects, shall not Religion it selfe be much more? Can there bee a like vertue or power in the shadow or image, as in the body it selfe? If the grapes painted by Zeuxis, allured the Birds to pecke at them, would not the Birds sooner have flowne at them, had they been true grapes? All the wit of these sublimated spirits, where∣with they entangle the honest simplicity of others, cannot wind them out of these dilemmaes: If it bee a bad thing to bee good, why doe they seem so? If it be a bad thing to seem bad, why are they bad? For if it bee a good thing to seeme good, it cannot but bee much better to bee so: If it bee a bad thing to seeme bad, it cannot but bee worse to bee so. Videre ergo quod es, vel esto quod videris, seem therefore what thou art, or bee what thou seemest: especially consi∣dering, that asCyr. poed. l. 2. Astyages in Xenophon wisely adviseth, the best meanes to seeme learned, is to bee learned; to seeme wise, is to bee wise; to seeme religious, is to bee religious. Hee that is not so, cannot long seeme so; and hee that is so, cannot but seem so. Fraud and guile
cannot goe long but it will bee espied. No Stage-player can so act anothers part, but that hee may bee discerned to bee a player: dis∣sembling will not alwayes bee dissembled; and when it is once de∣tected, it disableth the dissembler from ever after using his cousening trade. 2. It is not to be omitted, that fraud, guile, and deceit beare no fruits of themselves, but gather them from the honesty and simplicity of o∣thers, whom they circumvent. If all were such as themselves, lying upon the catch, they would make little advantage of their cheating trade; neither could there be any true friendship or society among men: and is that the best policy that overthroweth all policy and ci∣vill conversation? 3. Lastly, faithfulnesse and honesty are like naturall beauty and strength of body, which preserve themselves; but all fraudulent and deceitfull dealing, and cunning fetches, like complexion, where nature is much decayed, must bee daily laid on: or like physicke potions con∣tinually taken, and yet will not long helpe. All devices, plots, and fa∣brickes in the minde for advancing our estate, which are not built upon the foundation of faithfulnesse and integrity, continually need repairing, and upon a strong assault are easily cast downe, and fall upon the builders themselves. It will not bee amisse to consider the ends of some of these men. Of two that were most famous in this politicke craft, Achitophel and Hannibal, the one hanged, the other poysoned himselfe. Theramenes, who in the civill dissensions at Athens dealt under hand on all sides, in the end was discovered, and all parts joyn∣ing against him, made a spectacle of misery and scorne. A singular Ar∣tificer in this kinde, who put trickes upon all men, was sent for by Lewis the French King, saying, that hee had need of such an head, and when hee came to him, upon detection of divers of his cunning prankes, he was condemned by him to be beheaded. I should much wrong Alexander the sixth, and Borgias his sonne, not to put them in this Catalogue: for it was the common voice of all men (asBodin. de rep. sup. cit. Bodine wri∣teth) that the father never spake what hee meant, the sonne never did what hee spake: both held it for a Maxime, Fidem omnibus dandam, servandam nemini. According to which rule, when Borgias the sonne by fairest promises and deepest protestations of amity, and burying all former injuries, had drawne in the Captaines of the opposite facti∣on, as soone as hee had them in his power, contrary to all promi∣ses and oathes, put them all to death: whereof the Pope his father having notice, could not conceale his joy, but brake out into that execrable exclamation, O factum bene, Well done, thou art a sonne after mine owne heart. But hee escaped not the heavie judgement of God: for shortly after having caused a poysonous cup to bee tempe∣red for some of the Cardinalls, whose deaths he had vowed, through a mistake hee dranke off the same cup himselfe, and so ended his wret∣ched life. I seale up this whole discourse with the words of the blessed Apo∣stle; sith all dishonest, false, and unjust courses of thriving are not
onely disgracefull and shamefull, but also (all things considered) dis∣advantageous: Finally,Phil. 4.8. brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report: if there be any vertue, if there be any praise, thinke on these things, and the God of peace shall be with you. To whom, &c.
THE HIEW OF A SINNER. THE XLIII. SERMON. ROM. 6.21. Whereof ye are now ashamed. Right Honourable, &c. I Have long dwelt upon this text of Scripture, because I finde it richly stored with spirituall armour, and all ne∣cessary provision for our Christian warfare against sinne and Satan. Here wee may furnish our selves with those weapons against our ghostly enemies, that will pierce the strongest proofe of impudency, and draw blood even from a seared conscience. There is none so hardy and insensible, whom the losse of invaluable treasures will not touch to the quicke: present shame and future infamy wound at the heart, but eternall death kils outright. In comparison of these all the weapons which Philoso∣phy forgeth upon the anvile of reason, are but like arrowes with blunt heads, or blades with a soft edge, Irrita tela cadunt. Cic. de Off. c. lib. 3.The Stoicks devised many witty arguments to prove that profit and hone∣sty could not bee severed, and that dishonesty was alwayes joyned with dis∣advantage: but they were never able to maintaine them against infinite ex∣amples and instances every where occurring of sundry sorts of men enri∣ched by spoiling, relieved by oppressing, absolved by calumniating, advan∣ced by depressing, raised by undermining others: in a word, building their fortunes upon the ruines of other mens estates and their owne fidelity and honesty. Howbeit it is true that in their morall considerations they glanced at those very Topickes from whence the Apostle draweth his arguments,
the unprofitablenesse of dishonest courses, and the ill ends of wicked per∣sons. For the more to scare and deterre their hearers from by-wayes to honour and wealth, they set before their eyes the penalty of humane lawes, losse of goods and life, with shame and infamy, the perill whereof they incurred, if they swerved any whit in their actions from the faire and straight path of vertue, and morall honesty: and the consideration of these things might bee some restraint of outward acts, and open crimes; but no way of such wickednesse as is brought forth in secret, or rather not brought forth at all, but onely conceived in the heart. Mutinous or murmuring thoughts, unchaste lusts of the heart, ambitious desires, execrable projects and purposes, treasonable plots, and the like, stood in no awe of mans justice, or feare of ignominy and shame: the light reproveth those things only that are brought to it, justice must proceed secundum allegata & probata; they are but few offences that come within the Magistrates walk, & all that come are not taken: of those that are taken hold of, the greater part either breake away by force, or escape by favour. If Anacharsis were alive, hee would spye1 Plut. Apopth. Leges dixit a∣ranearum telis similes. cobwebbe lawes in every Court of justice, in which the lesser flyes are strangled, but the greater easily breake through them. And bee the lawes of any Commonwealth or Kingdome never so exact, yet Seneca his observa∣tion will bee true, Angusta est justitia ad legem justum esse; it is but narrow and scanty justice which extendeth no further than mans law. A man may be ill enough, and yet keepe out of the danger of the lawes of men, which are many wayes imperfect and defective: but the law of God is no way sub∣ject to this imputation; it is perfect, and, as the Prophet David speaketh,Psal. 119.96 exceeding broad: it reacheth to all the actions, words, and imaginations of all the sonnes of Adam; not a by syllable can passe, not a thought stray, not a desire swerve from the right way, but it falleth within the danger, and is lyable to the penalties annexed to it, which are most certaine and most grievous: 1 Externall, in the world. 2 Internall, in the conscience. 3 Eternall, in hell. The arguments that are hence drawne to deterre men from sinne and wic∣kednesse, are of a stronger metall, and have another manner of edge than rea∣son can set upon them:Heb. 4 12. For the word of God is quick and powerfull, & sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spi∣rit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. The Hyperbolicall commendation which theCic. de orat. l. 1. Fremant licet omnes, dicam quod sentio, biblio∣thecas omnes Philosopho∣rum unus mihi videtur duode∣cim tabula∣rum libellus, si quis legum fontes; & capita viderit, & auto∣ritatis pondere, & utilitatis u∣bertate supera∣re. Orator giveth of the Romane lawes, published in twelve Tables, of right belongeth to this member of the Apostles exhortation: it hath more weight of reason, and forcible arguments of perswasion to holinesse of life, and detestation of vice in it, than all the discourses of morall Philosophers extant in the world. Hence we learn, that their losses who trade with Satan are inestimable and irrecoverable: that wicked and ungodly courses and means to gain & thrive by, not onely deprive us of the comfortable fruition of all earthly, but also of the possession of all heavenly blessings: that even small offences when they come to light are sufficient to cover the sinner with shame and confu∣sion:
that all the filthinesse that lyeth in the skirts of the soule, shall be disco∣vered in the face of the sun, before men & Angels: that not only outward acts, but inward motions and intentions; not only loud & crying sins, but also still and quiet, that lye asleep as it were in the lap of our conscience; not only hai∣nous crimes, and transgressions of an high nature, but also those seeming good actions that have any secret filthinesse or staine in them, if it bee not washed away with the teares of our repentance, and blood of our Redee∣mer, shall bee brought into judgement against us, and wee for them con∣demned to death both of body and soule in hell. No tragicall vociferation, nor the howling and shricking of damned ghosts can sufficiently expresse the horrour and torments of that endlesse death, which is the end of sinne. What sinne hath proved for the time past, yee have heard; wee are at this present to consider what it is for the present: it hath beene unfruitfull, what fruit had yee? it is shamefull, whereof ye are now ashamed. Shame is defined byL. 2. Rhet. c. 6. . Aristotle, Agriefe and trouble of minde, arising from such evils as seeme to tend to our infamy and disgrace: somewhat more fully it may bee described, A checke of conscience condemning us for some in∣tention, speech, or action, whereby wee have defiled our conscience before God, or stained our credits before men. This affection is in all men, even in those that are shamelesse and impudent; who are not so called because they are without this irkesome passion, but because they shew no signe thereof in their countenance, nor effects in their lives. As impossible it is that in the conscience of a sinnerRom. 2.15. thoughts should not arise accusing him, as that there should bee a fire kindled and no sparks flye up. To pollute the conscience with foule sin, and not to be ashamed, is all one as to prick the tenderest part of the body, and to feele no paine.Suet. in Tib. Tiberius, who let loose the raines to all licentiousnesse, yet when hee gave himselfe to his impure pleasures, cau∣sed all the pictures to bee removed out of the roome: and Alexander Phe∣reus that cruell tyrant, when hee beheld a bloody Tragedy in the Theater, and therein the ugly and monstrous image of his barbarous cruelty drawne to the life, was so confounded therewith, that hee could no longer dissem∣ble his terrour of minde, nor expect the end of that dismall Scene. Now how deepe an impression shame and infamy make in the soule, wee may perceive by those who preferred death before it.Xen. l. 7. Cyr. Paed. . Panthea solemnly wished that shee might bee buried alive, rather than constrained to staine her blood and good name, by keeping company with any, how great soever hee were, contrary to her vow to her dearest Abradatus. AndOvid. Epist. Phillis Demo∣phoonti. Phillis ha∣ving lost her honour, voweth to make amends for it by her voluntary death. Stat necis electu tenerum pensare pudorem. Which Lucretia also practised, flying out of the world to shun the shame thereof, and spilling her blood which the tyrant had a little before stayned: and Europa thought one death too light a revenge for wronged chastity; Levis una mors est Virginum culpae. If shame and infamy were not the sharpest corrasives to a guilty consci∣ence,
the Prophet David would not so oft use these and the like imprecati∣ons against the enemies of God: Let them be confounded and perish that arePsal. 71.11. & 83.17. against my soule: and, let them bee counfounded and vexed evermore, let them bee put to shame and perish, let mine adversaries bee clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their owne confusion as with a cloake. Yea but if shame and confusion are the very gall and wormewood of Gods vengeance against the wicked, most bitter to the taste of the soule; what construction are wee to make of those words of the Prophet,Ezek. 36.32 O yee house of Israel, bee ashamed and confounded for your owne wayes? doth the Prophet here give them counsell to pull down Gods vengeance upon them∣selves? Nothing lesse. To cleare this point therefore wee must distinguish of shame; which is taken 1 Sometimes for a vertuous habit and disposition of the minde, consi∣sting in a mediocrity betweene two extremes; impudency in the defect, re∣proved in the Jewes by the ProphetJer. 8.12. Jeremy (were they ashamed when they committed abominations? nay they were not ashamed, neither could they blush:) and bashfulnesse, or rather cowardise, in the excesse, reproved by our Saviour in white livered professors;Luk. 9.26. Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the sonne of man bee ashamed when hee shall come in his owne glory, and in his fathers, and of the holy Angels. 2 Sometimes for a perturbation of the minde, or irksome passion, when our hearts smite us for some grievous sinne, wherewith wee are confounded within our selves; and with holyJob 42.6. Wherefore I abhorre my selfe, and re∣pent in dust and ashes. Job, even abhorre our selves for the time. 3 Sometimes it is taken for infamy and publike disgrace, when a man is madeZeph. 3.19. a spectacle of shame and derision to others. According to the first signification, men are said to be modest or shame∣fac'd; according to the second, ashamed and confounded in themselves; ac∣cording to the third, shamed, or put to shame, or branded with a note of infamy and shame. Shame in the first acception is the curbe of sinne, in the second the sense and smart of sinne, in the third the scourge of sinne: shame in the first sense is in us by nature, and groweth more and more by custome, and is improved by the grace of humility: in the second it is brought to us by sinne; for as smoake sutteth, so sinne blacketh, soyleth, and shameth the soule: in the third sense men are brought to it by justice, according to the words of thePsal. 40.14. Psalmist, Let them bee brought to shame. When the Apostle saith, thatEph. 5.12. it is a shame to name those things that are done by impure persons in secret, hee taketh shame in the first sense, and his meaning is, the things they doe in secret are so foule, so unnaturall, so abo∣minable, that a modest or shamefaced man cannot endure to heare of them, much lesse to rip them up and relate them, with all their odious circumstan∣ces. But when Ezra prayeth in these words,Ezra 9.6. O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are encreased o∣ver our heads, and our trespasses are growne up to the heavens; hee taketh shame in the second sense. Lastly, when the Prophets threaten sinners with shame, or by imprecations wish it unto them, they take shame in the third acception:Hab. 2.10.11 Thou hast consulted shame to thine owne house, by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soule: for the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it; that is, thou hast taken a course,
and advisedly studied how to bring ruine, shame, and disgrace upon thy selfe.Nah. 3.5. Behold, I come upon thee, saith the Lord of hostes, and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakednesse, and the kingdomes thy shame: that is, I will expose thee unto ignominy and disgrace, as the Prophet there expoundeth himselfe;Vers 6. I will cast abominable filth up∣on thee, and make thee vile, and set thee at a gazing stocke. In this place the Apostle evidently taketh the word in the second sense: What fruit had yee in those things whereof yee are now ashamed? that is, for which you now condemne your selves, and seeme filthy and abominable in your owne eyes. This shame, though it come alwayes from evill, yet good may come of it, if wee seriously consider what brought this shame and con∣fusion upon us, and turne our anger upon it which set us at oddes with our selves: and to this end the Prophet Ezekiel endevoureth to stirre up this perturbation, or troublous passion in the Jewes;Ezek. 36.32. O yee house of Israel, be ashamed and confounded for your wayes; that is, consider your owne follies, give glory to God, and take shame to your selves; abhorre your selves for those sinnes, for which yee have made God to abhorre you. Shame in this sense may bee a meanes to keepe us from shame in the third signification, and everlasting confusion: for though shame bee alwayes a signe of evill past or present, yet it is not alwayes an evill signe, but oftentimes a signe of grace. I cannot hold altogether with him in the Poet, who seeing a young man dye his cheekes with the tincture of vertue, said, Terent.Erubuit, salva res est: he hath blushed, all is well; yet with a little alteration the speech may passe, Erubuit, salutis spes est; hee hath blushed, therefore there is hope all may bee well. For so it com∣meth to passe in our inward conflicts with sinne, as in the skirmishes with outward enemies in the field; though the battell goe sore against us, and we lose both ground and men, yet till the colours and ensignes be taken by the enemy, the fight holdeth out, and there may be hope of better successe: but when the colours and ensignes are lost, wee give the battell for gone. Now the colours of vertue displayed by nature in the countenance, appeare in the blushes of shame and modesty: while these are to bee seene, though wee give ground to Satan, and lose many other gifts and graces, yet there may bee some hope of victory; but when Satan hath taken our colours, and cu∣stome of sinning hath taken away all sense of sinne, and blush of shame, our case groweth desperate, and without new aides and supply of graces from heaven, it is impossible to keepe our standing, much lesse recover our losses. As nothing is more to bee grieved for than for this, that wee cannot grieve for sinne; so ought wee to be ashamed of nothing more than of this, that wee are not ashamed of all finfull and shamefull actions. Shame is the strongest barre which nature hath set before our unruly lusts and desires, and if it bee removed, nothing can keep them within compasse. Yee are ashamed. The godly and wicked are both ashamed, sin affecteth
them both with the like malady, but they both apply not the like remedy: the godly seeke to plucke out the sting, that is, sinne in the conscience, which causeth all their anguish and paine; but the ungodly and wicked li∣ver endeavoureth onely to dead the flesh, and thereby asswage the paine for the present, leaving the sting of death in their soule, sinne festring in their conscience. The one abstaineth from sinne, that hee may avoid the shame of it; the other accustometh himselfe to it, that hee may be lesse sen∣sible of it: hee hardeneth his brow, and maketh it in the end of that metall, that it will not yeeld, or change hiew. Hee is like to him, that going into the water, and finding it extreme cold by lightly touching it with the soles of his feet, casteth himselfe suddenly into the river, and plungeth him∣selfe over head and eares, that hee may be lesse sensible of the frigiditie of that element: so this hardy sinner finding himselfe confounded at les∣ser sinnes, throweth himselfe headlong into greater, that he may be the sooner past all shame. Yee. To whom doth Saint Paul addresse his speech? to those whose loathsome sores were upon them, or to those who had washed them in the laver of regeneration, and now were cleane and sound? Surely to the latter, as appeareth by the words ensuing: But now yee have your fruit in holinesse. Notwithstanding these (though free from the guilt of sinne, yet) are not freed from the shame of it: Whereof (saith he) yee are now ashamed. For as in the finest cloth and stuffe, after the spot is taken out, there remaineth some staine: and as in the flesh of a man hurt, after the wound is cured, there remaines some scarre; so though the spot of our sinnes be washed out, and the wounds of our conscience cured, yet there remaines somewhat like a scarre or staine, defacing the image of God in us, which when the soule be∣holdeth, she is ashamed of her selfe. All other evills which sinne bringeth, are in some sort curable: the fire of Gods wrath kindled against us may be quenched by the teares of our repentance: the anguish of conscience may be asswaged by the balme of Gilead: the breach of charity may bee made up by satisfaction to the party whom we have wronged, and unfained recon∣ciliation: only the shame of sin, and the staine of our reputation and credit, can never be got out: Haec macula nec sanguine eluitur, our winding sheet which covereth our bodies, covereth not our shame; neither is our infamy buried in our grave with us. 1. Now ashamed. Now after the commission of sinne, or now after your conversion unto God. It is with all of us, as it was with our first Parent in Paradise; we first taste the forbidden fruit of sinne,Gen. 3.10. and then see our naked∣nesse, and are ashamed. We are now ashamed of those sinnes whereof we were not ashamed when wee committed them. What? Doth sinne then cleare the sight of the mind, and enlighten it with knowledge, because we see more in sinne after we have committed it? Nay, rather sinne darkneth the understanding, and putteth out the eyes of the minde. Surely Adam got no knowledge by eating the forbidden fruit, but lost by it, as all we his posterity find by our palpable ignorance in those things which most concerne us. Why then was the tree of the fruit whereof he tasted, called the tree of knowledge of good and evill? Because thereby Adam came to ex∣perience and feeling of the good hee lost, and the evill hee brought upon
himselfe and his posterity: as the horse may bee said to know the lash or spurre, and a childe the rod, when they feele the smart and paine of them. If this be true, that sinne rather infatuateth a sinner, than any way instru∣cteth him, or increaseth his knowledge; how commeth it then to passe, that sinne present should not worke much more shame and confusion upon us, than when it is past? that wee should not discover the deformity and loathsomenesse of pleasures as they are comming to us, but as they are going from us? Whence is that Latine Proverbe, Voluptates intuere abeuntes, non venientes? Why? doe they come unto us naked, and put off their masques when they take their leave of us? Nay, rather our eyes are shut when they come to us, and they are open when they goe from us: or, to speake more plainly, when they come towards us, and our desires run to meet them, we contemplate only that which is amiable and lovely in them, we take no notice of the turpitude and deformity in them: not but that wee might see it also if we would, but that we are not willing to looke that way, lest the sight of that which is filthy and nasty in them, should marre our mirth, and interrupt our pleasure. The ignorance of an incontinent man is not like the blindnesse of Regulus, which was forced; but of Oedipus, who pulled out his owne eyes. Aristotle in this point saw day-light as it were at a chinke, when propounding this question, Utrum scientia sit in incontinente? whe∣ther an incontinent man hath knowledge of what he doth? resolveth it thus: AnArist Eth. lib. 7. c. 5. incontinent man hath a generall knowledge, and a confused notion, that incontinency is many waies hurtfull and prejudiciall to him; but not a par∣ticular knowledge, that the action or pleasure wherewith he is then taken is of that nature. Why may not the particular be deduced out of the generall? It may, but he will not deduce it; he is not at leisure to enter so farre into the point, his heart is possessed with the present pleasure, which his sense thir∣steth after, and all his thoughts and affections are set upon it; so that for the present he cannot, or will not withdraw his mind from the delightfull object before him, to look behind him, & consider the danger he incurreth: like beasts that are drawne by the sweet smell of the Panther, but never take notice of his ougly head, before he turne upon them and devoure them: But after the intemperate person hath taken his fill of sinfull pleasure, hee is at leisure to bethinke himselfe what he hath done. Reason in the naturall man, and the Spirit of God in the regenerate Christian, bloweth the coale of knowledge within him, which lay hid under the ashes; and by the light thereof he seeth what manner of guests he hath entertained, and how they have soyled & slubbered his inward rooms, & made them most filthy and loathsome. ThePlin. nat. hist. l. 10. c. 4. Aqui∣lae cum Cervis praelia sunt, multum pulve rem volutatu collectum, in∣sidens corni∣bus ex utit in oculos pennis ora verberans, donec praeci∣pitet in rupes, &c. Eagle, before he setteth upon the Hart, rolleth himselfe in the sand, and then flyeth at the Stagges head, and by fluttering his wings so dustieth his eyes that he can see nothing, and then striketh him with his talons where he listeth. Beloved, yee have heard of the uncleane spirit in the Gospel, which led the possessed man intoMat. 12.43. dry places: the sand and dust, with which this Eagle filleth his wings, are earthly desires and sensu∣all pleasures, wherewith after he hath put out the eyes of the carnall man, he dealeth with him as he listeth. Mercury could not kill Argus till he had cast him into a sleep, and with an inchanted rod closed his hundred eyes. The Divell so tempereth the poysoned cup, which hee offereth to the vo∣luptuous
person, that hee feeleth nothing in the going downe of it but sweetnesse: but after he hath swallowed downe his draught, he feeleth a fire kindled within his bowels, and unlesse he take suddenly a great quantity of heavenly balsamum, it proveth the bane of his soule. 2 Now yee are ashamed. After your conversion & renovation, now God hath annointed your eyes with theApoc. 3.18. eye-salve of the Spirit, and yee disco∣ver the workes of darknesse, and cleerly see the filthinesse of your former unregenerate estate, ye are now ashamed. For now ye have some sense of the wrath of God, ye have some remorse of conscience, ye perceive what ye have lost, ye see the marke of infamy burnt into your name and credit by the hot iron that hath scared your consciences. To proceed from farther explication to a seasonable use and applicati∣on. The Apothecaries draw an oyle out of the Scorpion which over∣commeth the poyson of that Serpent, and applyed to the part that is stung, giveth present ease. Let us imitate them, and of that which issueth from sin, make a soveraigne antidote against it. Let us lay open and naked before the eies of our mind the loathsome filthinesse and ougly deformity thereof, that being agashed and confounded thereat, we may turn away from it with greatest detestation. Let us apprehend thoroughly, as heretofore the un∣fruitfulnesse, so now the odiousnesse, loathsomenesse, turpitude, and shame of sinne. A lewd conceit is an unconceivable pollution, a profane or impure speech an unspeakable wrong to God, a sudden joy a lasting griefe, a tick∣ling of the sense for a moment a perpetuall torment, with a scar in the con∣science, and staine in our good name, never to be fetched out. The advice whichEpist. 11. Aliquis vir bo∣nus nobis eli∣gendus est, & semper ante o∣culos haben∣dus, ut sic tan∣quam illo spe∣ctante viva∣mus, &c. Seneca giveth to Lucilius, very sage and good: Wheresover thou art, and whatsoever thou art about, suppose that Cato or Socrates is with thee, or some such other reverend or grave personage, before whom thou wouldest be ashamed to doe any thing that were unseemly. Beloved Christians, wee need not feigne to our selves, or make in our thoughts an imaginary pre∣sence of any mortall man, were he never so venerable, grave, or austere: for we are alwayes in the presence of our Judge.Hesiod. op. & dies l. 1. . Wheresoever we are, what∣soever we goe about, we have a thousand witnesses thereof within us, and the blessed Angels without us; and, which wee are to take speciall notice of, malignant spirits our ghostly enemies, observers and noters thereof. They who tender their credit and estimation, saith theArist. l. 2. Rhetor. Oracle of reason, if they imbarke themselves into any dangerous or questionable action, most of all shunne and avoid the company of Poets, Stage-players, Libellers, Regi∣sters, Notaries, Promoters, and the like: because if any thing should bee done amisse, these kind of men were like to blab it out, act it upon the stage, or make a by-word of it to their utter disgrace. Such we have alwaies about us, when we are about any wickednesse, I meane the accusers of the brethren, fiends of Hell, who keep a register of all our secret and open sins, wherewith they will often upbraid us in our life, grievously burthen us with them at our death, and which is worst of all, rip them up all at the day of judgement, and insult upon us for them. No women among the Ro∣manes might under a great penalty prostitute their bodies for gaine, ex∣cept they first made open profession thereof before the Aediles: and the reason of this law was, because they thought the very shame of making
open profession of such lewdnesse, would deterre and keep back all of that sexe from such infamous courses of life. Likewise I reade in the ancient Greek stories of the Milesian women, that upon some discontent, divers of them laid violent hands upon themselves, and could not bee restrained from this desperate practice, till a law was made, that all they that in such sort made away themselves, should bee carried naked with a halter about their neckes, before the rest of their sexe: after which law none were sound to attempt the like villany. Those with whom neither love of life, nor feare of death could prevaile, shame yet manicled, and kept perforce from that unnaturall and execrable crime of felony de se, or selfe-homicide. Deare Christians, were Adam and Eve so ashamed to see the nakednesse of their bodies, and the Milesian women to behold the naked carkasses of their sexe? how then shall we be confounded with shame, when our soules and consciences shall be laid open & naked to the eyes of the whole world? that all may see all our deformities, sores, markes, botches, blanes, gashes, scarres, spots, and abominable pollutions and uncleannesses? When a godly father amplifying upon that Text of the Apostle, We must all appeare before the judgement seat of Christ, pricked the veines of his auditory in this man∣ner: How many things are there which we know by our selves, but would not for all the world, that two or three should know as much besides? how then shall we looke? how shall wee be covered with shame and confusion, when all these things shall be laid out before the eyes of all men? At these words observing divers of his hearers to blush, and hide their faces, he thus growes upon them, Nunquid? nunc erubescitit? What? and doe yee now blush? are ye now ashamed at the hearing of these things? what will ye be when ye see them? how will ye blush and hang downe your heads, when the bookes of your consciences shall be opened, and men and Angels shall see and reade what is written in them? Men and brethren, what shall we do to avoid the terrour and horrour, the shame and confusion of that day? Let us now be ashamed of our sins, that we may not then be: for as Dolor est medicina doloris, So Pudor est medicina pudoris. O let us not cast more blots upon the booke of our conscience, but rather fetch out those which are there with the aqua fortis of our teares: let us open our wounds and sores full of corruption to our heavenly Chirurgian, by confession of our sinnes, that he may heale them: let us make uncessant prayers to our Saviour,Psal. 32.1. to cover all our imperfections with the robes of his righteousnesse; so shall we be truly blessed. For blessed are they whose un∣righteousnesse is forgiven, and whose sinnes are covered from the sight of the world, that they shame them not; from the sight of their consciences, that they confound them not; from the eyes of God, that they condemne them not. God the Father make us all so blessed, for the merits of his Sonne, through the powerfull operation of the Spirit; to whom, three persons, and one God, be ascribed, &c. Amen.
THE WAGES OF SINNE. THE XLIV. SERMON. ROM. 6.21. For the end of those things is death. Right Honourable, &c. TO every thing there is a season,Eccles. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. and a time to every purpose under heaven. A time to be borne, and a time to dye: a time to plant, and a time to plucke up that which is planted. A time to kill, and a time to heale: a time to breake downe, and a time to build up. A time to weep, and a time to laugh: a time to mourne, and a time to dance, &c. In which distri∣bution of time, according to the severall affaires of our life, all actions and accidents, all intents and events, all counsels and acts, all words and workes, all motions and cessations, businesses and recreations, beginnings and endings, inchoations and perfections: yea, affections also, as joy and griefe, love and hatred, have some part and portion of time laid out for them; sinne only is exempted, that is never in season. As the Apostle spake to SimonActs 8.21. Magus, Non est tibi pars, neque sors: it hath neither part nor lot in this partition; and yet it intrudeth upon us, and usurpeth upon ei∣ther the whole or the greatest part of our demised time. We heare of a time to build, and a time to pull downe: a time to spare, and a time to spend; but not in like manner a time to doe good, and a time to doe ill: a time to live godly, and a time to sinne: a time well to imploy, and a time to mispend: neither God nor Nature hath bequeathed any legacie of time to sinne. Sinne should have no existence at all, and therefore no time: no estate, and therefore nei∣ther terme. Sinne is none of Gods creatures, nor the issue of nature: there∣fore hath no just claime or title to time, the best of Natures temporall goods; much lesse to happy eternity, which is the purchase of the Sonne of God, to the price whereof Nature cannot come neere. Moreover, sinne mis-spendeth, spoyleth, maketh havocke of our time, abridgeth it, and of∣ten
cutteth it off: and therefore deserveth, that not a moment of time should be given to it. Will you have yet more reasons? ye have them in the Text, drawne from all the differences of time: sin hath been unfruitfull, is shame∣full, and will prove pernicious and deadly; therefore no portion or part of time is to be allowed to it, against which all times give in evidence. The time past brings in against it all sorts of dammages and losses sustained by it: (What fruit had yee?) The present time layeth open the shame & filthinesse of sinne: (Whereof yee are now ashamed.) The future produceth the great and grievous penalties, which the sinner by the breach of the eternall Law incurreth, (The end of those things is death.) A wise man holdeth intelligence with the time past by memory, with the present by prudent circumspection, with the time to come by provi∣dence: by re-calling that which was, & fore-casting what will be, he orde∣reth that which is; and therefore he cannot but be sufficiently advertised of those hainous and grievous imputations laid upon sinne by the Spirit of God in my Text. It is altogether unfruitfull and unprofitable, good for no∣thing: What fruit had yee? It is shamefull and infamous, Whereof yee are now ashamed. Nay, it is pestilent and pernicious: For the end of those things is death. If this forcible interrogatory of the Apostle, so full of spirit of per∣swasion, worke not in us newnesse of life, and a detestation of our former sinfull courses, we are not only insensible of our profit, prodigall of our credit and reputation, but also altogether carelesse of our life. Nihili est, saith thePlaut. in Pers. Certè nihili est qui nihil amat: quid ei homini opus est vitâ? Poet, qui nihil amat, he is of no account, who makes account of nothing: Non spirat, qui non aspirat, he breathes not, who gaspeth not af∣ter something. What then is that ye desire? How bestow ye your affecti∣ons? What object hath the command of your thoughts, and soveraignty over your wills and desires? Is it gaine, wealth, and affluence of all things? flye then sinne: for it is altogether unfruitfull and unprofitable. Is it glory, honour, and reputation? eschue then vice: for it bringeth shame and infa∣my upon you and your posterity. Is it long life? nay, with Melchizedek to have no end of your dayes? abandon all wicked courses: for they have an end, and that end is death, and that death hath no end. That sinne is unfruitfull, not only formaliter, but also effectivè, not only negatively, by bringing forth no fruit, but also positively, by bringing forth evill & corrupt fruit, by making the soule of man barren of the fruits of righteousnesse, yea, and the earth also and trees barren of the fruit which they would otherwise have brought forth to our great joy and comfort; hath been the subject of our former discourses, spent especially in the proofe of these particulars: That sinne eclipseth the light of our understan∣ding, disordereth the desires of the will, weakneth the faculties of the soule, di∣stempereth the organs of our body, disturbeth the peace of our conscience, choak∣eth the motions of the spirit in us, killeth the fruits of grace, inthralleth the soule to the body, and the body and soule to Sathan; lastly, depriveth us of the comfortable fruition of all temporall, and the fruition and possessions of all eternall blessings. All which laid together will make a weighty argument, bearing downe, and forcing our assent to this conclusion, That sinne is ste∣rill and barren: and consequently, that every sinner is an unthrift, and in the end will prove bank-rupt, how gainfull a trade soever hee seeme to
drive with Satan: for as Christ cursed the figge-tree in the Gospell, so God curseth all trees that beare the forbidden fruit of sinne; and therefore the Apostle truly tearmeth the works of darknesse unfruitfull, saying,Eph. 5.11. Have no fellowship with the unfruitfull works of darknesse, but reprove them rather. The godly man whose delight is in the law of the Lord, is likenedPsal. 1.3, 4. to a tree planted by the rivers of waters, which bringeth forth fruit in due season: but the wicked to chaffe which the winde scattereth abroad. For although they may sometimes build palaces upon the ruines of the Church, and fill their houses with the treasures of wickednesse, and their coffers with the Mammon of un∣righteousnesse, yet in the end they will appeare to bee no gainers, no nor sa∣vers neither by their trafficke with the Devill. For if they gain wealth, they lose grace; if they gaine glasse, they lose pearle; if they gaine earth, they lose heaven; if they gaine an estate for tearme of yeares among sinners, they lose an eternall inheritance with the Saints in light; if they gaine a small portion of the world, theyMar. 8.36. lose their whole soule: and what advantageth it a man to gaine the whole world, and to lose his owne soule? Alas, what gainedJosh. 7.25. Achan by his Babylonish garment, and wedge of gold? nothing but a heape of stones wherewith hee was battered in pieces. What gained Gehe∣zi2 Kin. 5.27. by his great bribe? a leprosie, that cleaved to him and his posterity after him. What gainedJudg. 8.27. Zeba and Zalmunna by taking the houses of God in their owne possession? a fearfull and most shamefull end. What gained1 Kin. 22.31. 2 Kin. 9.33. A∣hab and Jezabel by Naboths vineyard? the vine of Sodom, and the grapes of Gomorrah; it cost them their lives and their kingdomes. What gainedDan. 5.28. Balthasar by the plate of the Temple? the division of his crown betweene the Medes and Persians. What gainedAct. 5.5, 10. Ananias and Sapphira by their fraudulent keeping backe part of the price for which they sold their possessi∣ons? a sudden and most fearfull death. What gainedMat. 27.5. Judas by his thirty pieces of silver, which hee received to betray innocent blood? a halter to hang himselfe. As Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar,Dan. 4.19. this dreame bee to the Kings enemies; so I will be bold to say, such gaine as is made by commerce with Satan be to Gods enemies. Godlinesse hath the promises of this life, and the life to come, ungodlinesse of neither, but contrariwise threats of judge∣ments in both; which sometimes fall upon the estate of those that are rich, and not in God; sometimes upon their bodies, but alwayes upon their soules: either God suddenly bloweth them away from their great estates, or hee bloweth upon their estates and the fruits of their labours, and they subscribe probatum est to the Latine proverbs: Malè part a malè dilabuntur; and De malè quaesitis non gaudet tertius haeres: ill gotten goods prosper not. The officers whomSuet. in Vesp. Vespasian employed like spunges to sucke in the blood of the subjects, he after they were full squie∣zed them till they were dry. And how often doe we see the great spoylers of others spoyled themselves? and the secret underminers of other mens fortunes undermined themselves? the cruellest exacters upon their tenants exacted upon by their superiour Lords? In the second place I treated of the second attribute or consequent of sin, shame; and by evidence of Scripture, and testimony of every ones consci∣ence
proved that sin shameth us three manner of waies: 1 Within our selves, making us seeme most vile, filthy, lothsome and odious to our selves. 2 In the world, staining our credit, and branding us with a note of infamy. 3 At the tribunall of Christ, before God, Angels and men, when our consciences, which now like a scrole of parchment lye folded together, shall bee opened and spread abroad, that all men may read what is written there. If the consideration of the unfruitfulnesse and shame of sinne affect us not much, nor make any sensible alteration in our lives and conversations, behold yet stronger physicke which will worke with us if we be not dead already: The end of those things is death. Here are three bitter pills that are to bee taken by all them that surfeit in sinfull pleasures and worldly vanities, whe∣ther they bee lusts of the flesh, or lusts of the eye, or appertaine to the pride of life. 1 These things will have an end, The end. 2 The end of these things is fearfull, Death. 3 This death is the second death, and hath no end. I see, saith David,Psal. 119.96 that all things come to an end: but thy commandements are exceeding broad, yea so broad, that all wayes and courses besides the path of Gods lawes, come to a speedy end, and very short period. What the Historian observed concerning the race of men, Vita hominum brevit, prin∣cipum brevior, pontificum brevissima; that the life of man is shorter than of other creatures, of Princes than of other men, of Popes than of Princes; may be applied thus to our present purpose: The lives of men are but short, their actions and endevours of a shorter date, but indirect and sinfull courses of the shortest duration of all. All the fruit that comes of them, like the fig-tree cursed by our Saviour, withers suddenly. Crassus enjoyed not long the fruit of his covetousnesse, but was slain in war, and had melted gold poured into his mouth by the Parthians: Julius Caesar enjoyed not long the fruit of his ambition, but was stabbed with twenty five wounds in the Senate: He∣liogabalus enjoyed not long the fruit of his pleasure, but was slaine and throwne into a jakes: Dionysius enjoyed not long the fruit of his sacriledge and tyrannie, but was constrained to change his scepter for a ferular, and teach Scholars for a small stipend, to keepe him from starving. If the pro∣sperity of the wicked be an eye-sore unto us, as it was sometimes unto Da∣vid,Psal. 73.17, 18, 19. Let us enter into the sanctuary of God, and wee shall see the end of these men; namely, that God doth set them in slippery places, and casteth them downe to destruction. How are they brought into desolation as in a moment? they are utterly consumed with terrours. Achan spent not his wedge of gold, nor ware out his Babylonish garment, but was soone discovered, and stripped of all hee had, and came to a fearfull end. It was not long after Ahab and Jeza∣bel purchased a vineyard at the deare rate of the blood of the owner, but they watered it with their owne blood. Belshazzar had scarce concocted
the wine in his stomacke, which hee carowsed in the bowles of the Sanctu∣ary, before hee saw a hand writing his doome on the wall, and soone after felt the arme of Cyrus executing it upon him. Achitophel his policy tooke not long, for within a short space after he had animated the sonne against the father, his counsell was rejected, and hee hanged himselfe. The price of in∣nocent blood was not long in Judas his hands before with the same hands hee fitted his owne halter. Titus exhibited to the people stately pageants, pompes, carosels, and triumphant festivities for an hundred dayes; Asuerus kept royall feasts for halfe a yeere together: of both after the prefixed tearm was expired, nothing remained but infinite spoile of Gods creatures, and an excessive bill of charge. Hee that thriveth most by sinfull courses, and gur∣mandizeth all sorts of pleasures, and keepeth continuall holy-dayes a great part of his life; yet before hee goeth out of the light of this world, seeth an end of all his worldly happinesse, and there remaines nothing unto him but a sad remembrance, distempers in his body, wounds in his conscience, and a fearfull account to bee given to his Lord and Master for thus lavishing out his goods, and wasting his substance in riotous living. Pleasures like blos∣somes soone fall, the garlands of honour are withered in a few yeeres, the treasures of wickednes soon rust, all lewd and sensual, all base and covetous, all proud and ambitious, all false and deceitfull wayes have a short period, and a downfall into a lake that burneth with fire and brimstone. In ep. ad Rom. Servitutis cul∣pae triplex est incommodi∣tas, primo quia cum damno multo, secundo quia cum fru∣ctu nullo, ter∣tiò quia cum fine malo.Gorrhan summeth up all briefly thus: There is a threefold inconvenience of sinfull courses; because they who pursue them reape no fruit from them, sustaine much losse by them, come to an evill end through them: for the End. The end is taken 1 Either physically, 2 Or morally. Either for the finall cause, or for the finall effect. Death is not the finall cause of sin, but the finall effect: for no man sinneth for death, but dieth for sinne. Others distinguish of ends, which are, 1 Intermediate, as wealth, honour, or pleasure. 2 Ultimate, as happinesse. Death, say they, is not the intermediate end, but profit or delight; but it is alwayes the ultimate end of sinne unrepented of. A third sort make a diffe∣rence betweene the end, 1 Peccantis, of the sinner, that is, the end which the sinner in∣tendeth. 2 Peccati, of sinne, that is, the end to which sinne tendeth: this distinction seemeth to mee coincident with the first. Death, say they, is not the end of the sinner, but of the sinne; not the end which the sinner propoundeth to himselfe, but the end which his sinne brin∣geth
him unto. Withall they acutely observe, that the Apostle saith not, the end of those men is death, but the end Of those things. By those things hee understandeth the state of the unre∣generate, or those sinnes which were rife among the Romanes, and are reckoned up, chap. 1. which may bee reduced to three heads: 1 Impiety against God. 2 Iniquity against their neighbours. 3 Impurity against their owne body and soule, yea and a∣gainst nature also. 1 Impiety; with this hee brandeth them (vers. 21.) 2 Iniquity; with this hee chargeth them (vers. 29.) 3 Impurity; with this hee shameth them (vers. 24, 27.) Of those things the end is Death. The second death, say some; for he that hath no part in the first resurrection, hath his portion in the second death. A double death, saith Saint Ambrose, à morte enim ad mortem transitur, for a sinner from one death pas∣seth to another. Others more fully thus: The end of those things is death, 1 Of your estate, by ruine of your fortunes. 2 Of your good name, by tainting your reputation. 3 Of your body, by separation from the soule. 4 Of your soule, by separation from God. The most naturall interpretation, and most agreeable to this place, is, That by continuing in a sinfull course all our life, wee incurre the sentence, penalty and torment of eternall death: for that death is meant here which is opposed to eternall life, Verse. 23. which can bee no other than eternall. Yea, but is sinne in generall so strong a poyson, that the least quantity of it bringeth death, and that eternall? are all sinnes mortall, that is, in their owne nature deserving eternall death? It seemeth so, for hee speaketh in∣definitely, and without any limitation; and as before hee implyed all sinne to bee unfruitfull and shamefull, so also now to bee deadly. What fruit had ye in those things, that is, in any of those things whereof ye are now ashamed? Now it is certain that the regenerate are ashamed of all sins, therefore in like manner it followeth that the end of all sinnes is death. For the Apostle here compareth the state of sinne and state of grace in generall; and as hee exhor∣teth to all good workes, so hee endevoureth to beat downe all sinne, as un∣fruitfull, shamefull, and deadly. See what will ensue hereupon; first, that there are no veniall sinnes; secondly, no pardons for them in purgatory; thirdly, no fee for pardons. If all sinnes are mortall, and, which all Papists will they nill they must confesse, no man is free from all sinne; for,Jam. 3.. in ma∣ny things wee offend all, saith Saint James; and,1 Joh. 1.10. if we say that we have no sin wee deceive our selves, saith Saint John: what will become of their Romish doctrines concerning the possibility of fulfilling the law, the merit of con∣gruity or condignity, and works of supererogation? Si nulla peccata venialia nulla venalia, if no sinnes are veniall, then no sale to bee made of sinnes, no
utterance of pardons, no use of the Church treasury, no gold to bee got by the Monks new found Alchymy. Yee will say, this is but a flourish, let us therefore come to the sharpe: Mitte hebetes gladios, pugnetur acutis. The speech of Cornelius Celsus the Physitian is much commended by Bo∣dine; Nec aegrotorum morbi, nec languentium vulnera dicendi luminibus cu∣rantur; Soft words cure no wounds: wee may say more truely, soft words give no wounds, and therefore are not for this service of truth against er∣rour and heresie up in armes against her.Hom. Il. . Hector truely told Paris, that his golden harpe, and purfled haire, and beautifull painting, would stand him in no stead in theSen. ep. 51. In primo defi∣cit pulvere, ille unctus et niti∣dus. field: it is not the wrought scabbard, but the strong blade; nor the bright colour, but the sharpe edge of it, that helpeth in dan∣ger, and hurteth the enemy. In which regard I hold it fittest to handle schoole points scholastically, in tearmes rather significant than elegant, and labour more for force of argument than ornaments of speech. First then, after their plaine method, I will explicate the state of the question; next, meet with the adversaries objections; and last of all, produce arguments for the truth, and make them good against all contrary cavils, and frivolous ex∣ceptions. Sins may bee tearmed veniall or mortall two manner of wayes: 1 Either comparatè, in comparison of others: 2 Or simplicitèr, simply, and in themselves: and that three manner of wayes: Either 1 Ex naturâsuâ, of their owne nature. 2 Ex gratiâ, by favour or indulgence. 3 Ex eventu, in the issue or event. Wee deny not but that sinnes may bee tearmed veniall comparatè, that is, more veniall than others; and if not deserving favour and pardon, yet lesse deserving punishment than others. Secondly, veniall ex eventu or in the issue wee acknowledge all the sinnes of the Elect to bee; and some sinnes of the Reprobate also; or veniall ex gratiâ, that is, by Gods favour and cle∣mency: all the question is, whether any sinne of the Elect or Reprobate bee veniall ex suâ naturâ, that is, such as in its owne nature deserveth not the pu∣nishment of death, but either no punishment at all, or at least temporary onely. The reformed Churches generally resolve, that all sinnes in their owne nature are mortall; theBellar. de amis. grat. & stat. pec. c. 9. Qui dixerit, fatue, reus erit gehennae ignis: ex his tale con∣ficitur argu∣mentum, mani∣festum conviti∣um facit reum gehennae ignis, non item subi∣ta iracundia, &c. Romanists will have very many to be veni∣all. Their allegations are chiefly these: the first out of Matthew 5.22. Who∣soever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judg∣ment: and whosoever shall say to his brother Racha, shall bee in danger of the Councell: but whosoever shall say, thou Foole, shall bee in danger of hell fire. Here, say they, wee may see that there are two punishments lesse than hell fire, and that hee onely is in danger of it, who breaketh out into that out∣rage, to raile at his brothet, and call him foole; not hee who is unadvisedly
angry. Whereupon they inferre, that the last of the three sinnes mentio∣ned by our Saviour, is mortall, not the two former. Their second allegation is out ofMat. 7.5. Moat out of thy brothers eye. Matth. 7. andLuk. 6.41. Luk. 6. and 1 Cor. 3. and such other texts of Scriptures, in which some sinnes are compared to very light things, as to1 Cor. 3.12. Hay and stub∣ble. hay, to stubble, to a moat, to aMat. 5.26. The uttermost farthing. farthing. Surely, say they, they cannot bee grievous and weighty sinnes, which are compa∣red to such light or vile things of no value. Their third allegation is out of Saint James,Jam. 1.15. Sinne when it is finished bringeth forth death: Marke, say they, not every sinne, nor sinne in every degree, but when it is come to its perfection bringeth forth death; whereby hee insinuateth, that no sinnes are mortall but those which are consummate, brought into act, and committed with full consent of the will. The fourth is out ofMat. 12.36. Matth. 12. I say unto you, yee shall give an account for every idle word at the day of judgement. Hee saith not, wee shall bee con∣demned for every idle word, but onely that wee shall bee called to answere for it, as wee shall be for all sinnes. To the first allegation wee answere, That no doctrine of faith may bee grounded upon a meere parable, as the Schooles rightly determine; Theo∣logia parabolica non est argumentativa. Now that which our Saviour here speaketh of three severall punishments, is spoken by allusion to the pro∣ceedings in the Civill Courts in Judaea; and all that can bee gathered from thence is but this, That as there are differences of sinnes, so there shall bee differences of punishments hereafter. Secondly, hell fire is no more proper∣ly taken for the torment of the damned, than the other two, the danger of the Councell, and of Judgement, which all confesse to bee taken figuratively and analogically. Thirdly, Maldonate the Jesuite ingenuously confesseth, that by Councell and Judgement the eternall death of the soule is under∣stood; yet with this difference, that a lesse degree of torment in hell is un∣derstood by the word Judgement than Councell; and a lesse by Councell than by gehenna ignis, that is, the fire in the valley of Hinnom. To the second allegation wee answere, First, that though some sinnes in comparison of others may bee said light, and to have the like proportion to more grievous sinnes, as a moat in the eye hath to a beame, a farthing to a pound; yet that no sinne committed against God may bee simply tearmed light, but like the talent of lead mentioned Zech. 1.5. Whereupon SaintSuper Ezek. l. 2. Omne pec∣catum grave est. Gregory inferreth, Every sinne is heavie and ponderous: and SaintJer. Epitaph. Paulae. Ita le∣via peccata de∣flebat, ut gra∣vissimotum scelerum dice∣res ream. Et ep. 14. Ne∣scio an posse∣mus leve ali∣quod peccatum dicere, quod in Dei contemp∣tum admitti∣tur. Jerome writeth of Paula, That shee so bewailed light sinnes (that is, such as are com∣monly so esteemed) that a man would have thought her guilty of grievous crimes: and hee elsewhere yeeldeth a good reason for it; Because, saith he, I know not how wee may say any thing is light, whereby the divine Majesty is sleighted. Secondly, admitting that some sinnes are to bee accounted no bigger than moats, yet as a moat it it bee not taken out of the eye hindereth the sight, so the least sinne hindereth grace, and if it bee not repented of, or pardoned for Christs sake, is sufficient to damne the soule of the sinner. Thirdly, neither Christ by the farthing in the fifth of Matthew understan∣deth sinne, nor the Apostle by hay and stubble lesser or veniall sinnes; but Christ by farthing understandeth the last payment of debt, Saint Paul light and vaine doctrines, which are to bee tryed by the fire of the Spirit. For
in that place the Apostle by fire cannot meane the fire of Purgatory, be∣cause gold and silver are tryed, that is, precious doctrines or good workes, by the fire Saint Paul there speaketh of: whereas Purgatory fire is for mens persons, to cleanse and purge them from their lesser sinnes, as the Pa∣pists teach. To the third allegation we answer, That the Apostle is so farre from de∣nying in that place that all sinnes are mortall, that on the contrary he there sheweth how all sinnes become mortall, and in the end bring the sinner to eternall death. What lesser sinne than lust, or a desire in the mind? yet this (as Saint James affirmeth) hath strength enough to conceive sinne, and sinne when it is finished to bring forth death. To the fourth allegation we answer, That the same phrase is used concer∣ning all kindes of sinnes: yea, those that are greatest and most grievous; as we reade in Athanasius Creed, All men shall rise againe with their owne bo∣dies, and give an account of their owne workes: and if their account be not the better, that dreadfull sentence shall passe against them, Goe ye cursed in∣to everlasting fire. Let us lay all these particulars together, and the totall arising out of them will be this, That though there be a great difference of sinnes, whereof some are lighter, compared to a fescu, or moate; others heavier, compared to a beame: some smaller, likened to gnats; others greater, toMat. 23.24. camels; some easier to account for, resembled to mites or farthings; others with more dif∣ficulty, as talents: and in like manner, although there are divers degrees of punishments in hell fire, as there were divers degrees of civill punishments among the Jewes; yet that we are accountable for the least sinnes, and that the weakest desire and suddenest motion to evill is concupiscence, which if it be not killed in us by grace, will conceive sinne, and that sinne when it is con∣summate will bring forth death. We need no more fightings the truth hath already gotten the victory by the weapons of her sworne enemies, and Go∣liah is already slaine with his owne sword; yet that yee may know how strong the doctrine of our Church is, I will bring forth, and muster some of her trained band. First, we have two uncontrollable testimonies out of the booke of Deu∣teronomy,Deut. 27.26. & 30.19. Cursed is hee that confirmeth not all the words of this Law to doe them: and, Behold, I have set before you this day life and good, death and evill, blessing and cursing. The former is cited by Saint Paul, to prove that all that hoped to be justified by the Law were under the curse: for it is written, saith he,Gal. 3.10. Cursed is every man that confirmeth not all things that are written in the Law to doe them. Now there is no commandement which is not written in the booke of the Law, to which whosoeverDeut. 4.2. addeth, is accursed. To these plaine and evident passages of Scripture may bee adjoyned three like unto them, TheEzek. 18.4. Rom. 6.23. 1 Cor. 15.56. soule that sinneth shall dye. The wages of sinne is death: and, The sting of death is sinne. These pregnant testimonies the Cardinall endeavou∣reth to elude with these and the like glosses; The soule that sinneth, that is, mortally, shall dye: and the wages of sinne, that is, of mortall sinne, is death: and the sting of death is sinne, that is, deadly sinne. With as good colour of reason in all Texts of Scriptures wherein we are deterred from sinne, he might interpose this his glosse, and say, eschue evill, that is, all deadly evill:
flye sinne, that is, mortall sinne: and consequently deny that veniall sinnes are any where forbidden. But as when wee reade in the common or civill law these and the like titles, the punishment of felony, murder, treason, fi∣mony, sacriledge, we understand the law of all crimes of the same kind; so in like manner when the Apostle saith indefinitely, the wages of sinne is death, we are to understand him of every sin: for, Non est distinguendum ubi lex non distinguit, we must not distinguish where the law distinguisheth not. For he that so doth, addeth to the law, or taketh from it, and thereby in∣curreth the curse pronounced by the law-giver. And though other Texts of Scriptures might brooke the like restriction, yet not those above al∣ledged. For what is the meaning of this phrase, Death is the wages of sin; but that sinne deserveth death? which is all one as to say, that sinne is mor∣tall. Now adde hereunto Bellarmines glosse, The wages of sinne, that is, mortall sinne, is death: and, the soule that sinneth, that is, that sinneth mor∣tally, shall dye; and the propositions will prove meere tautologies, as if the Prophet had said, The soule that sinneth a sinne unto death shall dye; and the Apostle, sinne that deserveth death, deserveth death. What is it to de∣prave the meaning of the Holy Ghost, if this be not? especially conside∣ring, that the Prophet Ezekiel in the selfe same chapter, ver. 31. declareth his meaning to be of sinne in generall, without any restriction or limitati∣on: Cast away from you all your transgressions, and make you a new heart, so iniquity shall not be your destruction. Here ye see no means to avoid death, but by casting away all transgressions: for sith the Law requirethJam. 2.10. Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, & yet offendeth in one point, is guilty of all. entire obedience, he that violateth any one commandement, is liable to the pu∣nishment of the breach of the whole Law. To smother this cleare light of truth, it is strange to see what smoaky distinctions the adversaries have devised of peccatum simpliciter and secundùm quid, and peccatum contra Le∣gem and praeter Legem, sinnes against the Law and besides the Law: Ve∣niall sinnes, say they, are besides the Law, not against the Law. Are not they besides themselves that so distinguish? For let them answer punctually, Doth the Law of God forbid those they call veniall sinnes, or not? If not, then are they no sinnes, or the Law is not perfect, in that it meeteth not with all enormities and transgressions: If the Law forbiddeth them, then are they against the Law. For sinne, saith Saint John, is the1 John 3 4. trans∣gression of the Law. If then veniall escapes are sinnes, they must needs be violations of the Law, and so not onely praeter, besides, but contra Legem, against it. The Law (as Christ expoundeth it) Matthew the fifth, forbid∣deth a rash word, a wanton looke, nay unadvised passion; and what les∣ser sinnes can be thought than sinnes of thought? therefore, saithMoral. p. 1. l. 4. Azorius the Jesuit, we must say that veniall sinne is against the Law, as Cajetan, Durand, and Vega taught: we must say so, unlesse we will reject the defi∣nition of sinne given by Saint Austine, and generally received by the Schooles (dictum, factum, vel concupitum contra Legem aeternam, that sinne is a thought, word, or deed against the eternall Law) unlesse wee will con∣tradict the ancient Fathers, by name, SaintGreg. l. 8. in Job. In prae∣senti mortem carnis patior, & tamen ad∣huc de futuro judicio gravio∣rem morte destructionis tuae sententiam pertimesco, quantâlibet enim justiciâ polleant, nequaquam sibi ad innocentiam vel electi sufficiunt, si in judicio districtè judicentur. Gregory: In the morning if thou seeke mee, thou shalt not finde mee. Now I sleep in dust, that is, in this
present I suffer the death of the flesh, and yet in the future judgement I feare the sentence of damnation, more grievous than death: for the Elect themselves, how righteous soever they are, will not be found innocent, if God deale with them according to strict justice: And SaintEp. 14. Om∣ne quod loqui∣mur, aut de la∣tâ, aut de an∣guttâ viâ est. si cum paucis subtilem quan∣dam semitam invenimus ad vitam tendi∣mus; si multo∣rum comita∣mur viam, se∣cundum Do∣mini sententi∣am imus ad mortem. Jerome, Whatsoever we doe, what∣soever we speake, either belongs to the broad way or to the narrow; if with a few we find out a narrow path, we tend toward life: if we keep company with many in the great road, we goe to death. And in his secondLib. 2. cont. Pel. c. 4. Quis nostrûm potest huic vitio non subjacere? cum etiam pro otio∣so verbo reddi∣turi simus rati∣onem in judi∣cio, si ita, & sermonis inju∣ria, atque in∣terdum jocus judicio, couci∣lioque, & ge∣hennae ignibus delegantur, quid merebi∣tur turpium re∣rum appetitio? booke against the Pelagians, where rehearsing the words of our Saviour, He that is unad∣visedly angry with his brother, shall bee in danger of judgement, thus re∣flecteth upon himselfe and his brethren: Which of us can be free from this vice? If unadvised anger, and a contumelious word, and sometimes a jest, bringeth a man in danger of judgement, councell, and hell fire, what doe im∣pure desires, and other more grievous sinnes deserve? And SaintChrys. com. in Mat. 5. Mi∣rantur multi hominem qui fratrem levem aut fatuum ap∣pellaverit, sempiternae morti condem∣nari, cum ter∣tio quo{que} ver∣bo alti alus id dicere solea∣mus. Chryso∣stome, who thus quavereth upon the same note: Many are startled when they heare that he shall be condemned to eternall death, who calleth his brother gid∣dy-braine or foole; sith nothing is so common among us, wee hardly speake three words in disputing with any man, but we breake out into such course lan∣guage. Yea, but some will say, What? is the nodding at a Sermon, the stealing a farthing, the breaking of a jest such an hainous matter, that it deserveth everlasting torments of body and soule in Hell? I answer with SaintAug. l. 2. cont. Donat. Non afferamus sta∣teras dolosas, ubi appenda∣mus quod vo∣lumus, & quo∣modo volu∣mus pro arbi∣trio nostro, di centes hoc grave est, hoc leve, sed afferamus stateram divinam de Scripturis sanctis, tanquam de thesauris Domini, & in illâ quid sit grave appendamus. Au∣stine, in the estimation of sinnes we ought not to bring out deceitfull weights of our owne, but out of the Scriptures, golden weights sealed by God, and in them see what is light, and what is weighty. In these scales wee shall find the least sinne to be heavie enough to weigh down to the ground, yea, to Hell: for every offence committed against an infinite Majesty, deserveth an infi∣nite punishment: every transgression of the eternall Law, excludeth a man from eternall happinesse, and deserveth eternall death: Whosoever shall breake one of the least commandements, saith ourMat. 5.19. Saviour, and teach men so, shall be least in the Kingdome of heaven. Here Bellarmine wisheth us to marke, that Christ saith not simply, hee that breaketh one of the least com∣mandements, but he that breaketh it and teacheth others to doe so. We mark it well, and that clause may serve to brand him and his fellow Priests and Jesuits: for who teach men to break the least commandements, if not they, whose doctrine is, that veniall sinnes are not against the Law, nor sim∣ply and properly to be called sinnes, but rather naevuli, aspergines, and pul∣visculi, that is, dustings, or spertings, or small spots, warts, or blisters. Yee all perceive how much this Text of Scripture maketh for us in our doctrine against Papists; but I feare it maketh as much against us in our lives. Doe we so live, as if we were perswaded that the least sinnes, inas∣much as they are committed against an infinite Majesty, and are breaches of his eternall Law, are exceeding great, nay infinite? Could we drink ini∣quity as the beast doth water, if we thought it were deadly poyson? Doe we make great account of small sinnes? nay doe we not rather make small account of the greatest? Who ever espyed an Adder thrusting his sting at him, and started not backe? Natures insensible of paine, and ignorant of
that danger, doe no lesse. For if any venemous thing be applyed to any part of our body, the bloud, as if it took notice of its deadly enemy, flyeth back, & turneth it streams another way: and shall not our conscience, which hath knowledge and sense of the venome of sinne, be much more fearfull of it? It is no amplification of the malignant nature of sinne, to compare it to a poyson: it is rather a diminution. For no poyson could ever yet be made so strong, that the least imaginary quantity thereof was deadly; the least thought of sinne, yea the sinne of thought is so. Poysons be they never so pernicious and deadly, are pernicious and hurtfull to that part onely which of it selfe is mortall, I meane our bodies; but sinne killeth that part that naturally cannot dye: it slayeth our immortall spirits. There are ma∣ny forcible arguments to deterre us even from small sins, and to excite us to watch over them: as, 1. Quia difficiliùs caventur, because it is a thing more difficult to avoid them than the greater. Many are choaked with small bones of fishes, but few with greater; because they are usually felt in the mouth before they goe downe the throat. Solinus writeth of a kind ofPolihist. c. 8. Brevissima a∣pud Amyclas vipera est, ac propterea dum despectui est, faciliùs nocet. viper of a small quan∣tity, that doth much more hurt than the greater, because the most part of men sleighten it. 2. Quia difficiliùs curantur, because the wound that is given by them is with more difficulty cured: as a pricke made with a bodkin, or a steeletto, if it be deep, is more dangerous than a wound given with a greater wea∣pon; because the flesh presently closeth up, and the bloud issuing not forth, runneth inwardly with greater abundance. 3. Quia ad majora viam muniunt, because they are a preparation and disposition to greater offences. As the wimble pierceth the wood, and ma∣keth way for the auger; so the smaller sinnes make a breach in the consci∣ence, and thereby a way to greater. The least sins are as the little theeves that creep in at the windowes, and open the doores to the greater, that rifle the house, and rob the soule of all her spirituall wealth: whence is that ob∣servation of SaintLib. 9. mor. in Job. Si vitare parva negligi∣mus, insensi∣biliter seducti majora etiam perpetramus. Gregory, If we sticke not at small sinnes, ere we are aware we shall make no bones of the greatest. 4. Quia parva peccata crebra ita nos praegravant, ut unum grande, be∣cause small sinnes with their multitude and number as much hurt the soule, as great sinnes with their weight. The Herrings, though a weake and con∣temptible kind of fish, yet by their number kill the greatest Whale. What skilleth it (saith SaintAug. ep. 108. Quid inte∣rest ad naufra∣gium, an uno grandi fluctu navis operia∣tur, an paula∣tim subrepens aqua in senti∣nam, & per negligentiam derelicta im∣pleat navem, atque submer∣guntur? Et serm. 10. de di∣vers. Quid interest utrum te plumbum premat an arena? plumbum una massa est, arenae minuta grana sunt: nonne vides de minutis guttis impleri flumina? minuta sunt, sed multa sunt. Austine) whether a ship be over-whelmed with one great wave, or drowned by a leake in the bottome unespyed, in which the water entereth drop by drop? What easeth it a man to be pressed to death with a heap of sands, more than with a sow of lead? Are not the greatest ri∣vers filled by drops? The sinnes we ordinarily commit, minuta sunt, sed multa sunt, they are small, but they are many; and what they lose in the quantity, they get in the number. These indeed are important considerations, yet (mee thinkes) there is more, nay there is all that can be said in this clause of the Apostle, The end of those things is death: the smaller sinnes, as well as the greater, in their
owne nature are mortall. It is a more fearfull thing, I confesse, to be plun∣ged into the bottome of a headlesse lake, than to sinke a little under water: yet he that is held under water, how neere soever it be to the top, till his breath is gone, is as certainly drowned, as he that is found dead in the bot∣tome. It is but a miserable comfort to bee put in hope of an upper roome in Hell, and not to be thrust into the lowest dungeon. Wherefore, as yee tender the life of your bodies and soules, hearken to a word of exhortation: Taste not the least drop of the poyson of sinne; for though it put you not to so great torment, and be not so present death, yet deadly it is, and with∣out repentance and saving grace will kill your soules. Destroy the Cocka∣trice in the shell, breake the smallest seeds of sinne in your soule, as the Em∣met biteth the seeds which she layeth up for her selfe, that they may not grow againe in the earth. Parvulos Babylonis allidite ad petram, in quâ ser∣pentis vestigia non reperiuntur; Dash the Babylonish babes against that rocke, into which no serpent can enter. I know not how it commeth to passe, that as in nature we see the Adamant, which nothing relenteth at the stroake of the hammer, is dissolved with the warme bloud of a Goate; the Elephant, which no great beast dare encounter, is killed by a small Mouse creeping in at his truncke, and eating his braines; and the Lions in Mesopotamia are so pestered with a kind of Gnat, flying into their eyes, that to be rid of the paine, they sometimes teare them out with their clawes, and sometimes drowne themselves: so the strongest Christians are often over-taken with the least temptations, and conquered with a reed, nay, with a bull-rush. To forbeare more examples; David was taken by a look only: Peter affrighted by the speech of a Damsell: Alipius was overthrowne by a shout in the Theater. The breach of the Commandement in lesse things, even because they are lesse, and so might more easily be avoided, maketh the disobedi∣ence the greater; and all sinne is the more dangerous, by how much the lesse it is feared. Saint Austine maketh mention of certaine flies in Africa, so small, that they can scarce be discerned from moates in the ayre: Quae tamen cum insederint corpori acerbissimo fodiunt aculeo, which yet are armed with a most venemous sting: those little sins that are so small, that we can scarce discerne them to be sinnes, are like those Cynifes Saint Austine speaketh of, they pricke the conscience with a most venemous sting. Now if the sting of these small Flies put the conscience to such paine, and affect it with such anguish, who will be able to endure the teeth of the Adder, or the taile of the Scorpion? If whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the Judgement: and whosoever shall say unto his brother, Racha, shall be in danger of the Councell: and whosoever shall say, Thou foole, shall be in danger of hell fire; what punishment is he like to endure, who beareth malice in his heart against his brother, envieth his prosperity, undermineth his estate, woundeth his good name, nay spilleth his bloud? this is a crim∣son sinne, and mortall in a double sense: not onely because it slayeth the soule, but also because it killeth the body. If we shall give an account at the day of judgement for every idle word, what answer shall we make for irreli∣gious and blasphemous words? for calumnious and detractious speeches? for uncharitable and unchristian censures? for false witnesse? for oathes? for perjury? I am loth harder to rub on the sores and galls of your consci∣ences,
and leave them raw: therefore my conclusion shall be the applicati∣on of a plaister unto them, which will certainly heale them. That which our Saviour after his resurrection promised to those that should beleeve on his Name, that if theyMar. 16.18. dranke any deadly thing it should not hurt them, was per∣formed according to the letter to the Disciples in the first ages; but in the spirituall sense to all of us at this day. If we have drunke any deadly poyson of sinne, as who hath not? yet through repentance and faith in Christs bloud it shall not hurt us. The nature of poyson is to work upon the bloud, and to venome that humour: but contrariwise, the bloud of our Saviour worketh upon the poyson of sinne, and killeth the venemous malignity thereof. Though the most veniall sins in mens esteeme are mortall in their owne nature, yet the most mortall are made veniall by grace. No sin mor∣tall but to the reprobate and infidell; no sinne veniall but to the elect and faithfull: nay, no sinne but mortall to the reprobate and infidell, no sinne but veniall to the faithfull and penitent. Nothing deadly to Gods chosen, nay, not death it selfe. For the sting thereof is plucked out by Christ: O death,1 Cor. 15.57. where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be unto God, who hath given us victory through Jesus Christ our Lord. Thanks be unto thee, OHieron. epit. Nepot Gratias tibi, Christe Salvator, nos tua agimus cre∣atura, quòd tam potentem adversarium dum occideris, occidisti. Saviour, who hast given death his deaths wound by thy death. Beloved Christians, so many sins as we have committed, so many deaths eternall wee have deserved; from so many deaths Christ hath delivered us: and therefore so many lives, if we had them, we owe unto him, and shall we not willingly render him this one, for which hee will give us immortality, blisse, and glory in heaven with himselfe? Cui, &c.
THE GALL OF ASPES: OR THE PANGS OF THE SECOND DEATH. THE XLV. SERMON. ROM. 6.21. For the end of those things it death. Right Honourable, &c. I Hope time hath not razed those characters out of your memory, which I borrowed from time it selfe, to imprint my observations upon this Text in your mind. Sinne (as yee have heard) may be considered in a refe∣rence to a three-fold time: 1. Past, 2. Present, 3. Future. In relation to the first, it is unfruitfull: to the second, shamefull: to the third, pernicious and deadly. The unfruitfulnesse of sinne cannot but worke upon all that have regard to their estate in this world; the shamefulnesse of sinne cannot but touch neere, and affect deeply all that stand upon their reputation and good name; but the deadlinesse or pernicious nature thereof cannot but prevaile with all, to beware of it, that tender their life here, or immortality hereafter. If sinne be unfruitfull, have no fellowship with the workes of darknesse, but re∣prove them rather. If sinne be shamefull, hate even the garments spotted by the flesh; let not such things be named among you, much lesse practised, which cast a blurre upon your good name and fame among the Saints of God. If
sinne be pernicious and deadly, flye from it as from a Serpent: taste not the wine of Sodome, nor presse the grapes of Gomorrah; for their wine is the bloud of the Dragon,Job 20.14. and the gall of Aspes, which we know is present death. The end of those things. That is, all the pompe and vanity of this world, the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, the pride of life: all sinfull plea∣sures, wherewith yee surfeit your senses, shall have an end, and this end is death, and this death shall have no end. This is the last and most forcible argument of the three, wherewith the Apostle laboureth with might and maine to beat downe sinne, and put to flight even whole armies of tempta∣tions. Yee may observe a perfect gradation in the arguments: the first, though strong and forcible, drawne from the unfruitfulnesse of sinne, is not so necessary and constraining as the second, drawne from the shame and infamy thereof: nor that as the third, drawn from the wages thereof, which is everlasting death. As honour and glory is to be more set by than gaine and commodity, life than honour, immortality than life; so shame and in∣famy is worse than losse and disadvantage, death than shame, hell than death. The holy Apostle hath now made three offers unto us, and put us to a three-fold choice. First, he laid before us the faire fruits of Paradise, to bee gathered from the tree of life; and corrupt & rotten fruit from the forbidden tree: that is, invaluable treasures to be got, and inestimable profit to be made by god∣linesse; and irrecoverable losses to be sustained by ungodly and sinfull cour∣ses of thriving. Secondly, he tendered unto you glory and honour, to be purchased by the service of God; as on the contrary shame and infamy by retaining upon Sathan, and pursuing sinfull pleasures. Now in the third place hee setteth before you life and death; life by the gift of God, and death for the hire of sinne. Shall I need to exhort you in the words ofDeut. 30.19. Moses, Chuse life? how can ye doe otherwise? Is the flesh ap∣palled at the death of the body, though the paine thereof endure but for a moment? and shall not the spirit be much more affrighted at the death of the soule, the pangs and paines whereof never have an end? If there be any so retchlesse and carelesse of his estate, that hee passeth not for great and irrecoverable dammages and losses: so foolish that hee esteemes not of in∣estimable treasures: if any be so infamous, that he hath no credit to lose, or so armed with proofe of impudency, that hee can receive no wound from shame: yet I am sure there is none that liveth, who is not in some feare of death, especially a tormenting death, and that of the soule, and that which striketh all dead, everlasting. Therefore it is (as I conceive) that the Apo∣stle, according to the precept of Rhetoricians,Cic. de orat. l. 2. Puncta caeterorum argu∣mentorum occulit, coucheth as it were, and hideth the points of other argu∣ments, but thrusteth out this, putting upon it the signe and marke of a rea∣son (For.) For the end of those things is death. And this hee doth for good reason, because this last argument is worth all the former, and enforceth them all: it not only sharpneth the point of them, but draweth them up to the head at the sinner. For therefore are lewd and wicked courses unprofita∣ble; therefore we may be ashamed of them, because their end is so bad.
For the end. Why doth the Apostle skip over the middle, and come presently to the end? why layeth hee the whole force of his argument up∣on the end? 1. Because there is nothing in sinne upon which wee may build, or have any assurance thereof but the end, as there is nothing certaine of this our present life, but the incertainty thereof. Sin somtimes hath no middle, as wee see in those fearfull examples of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, who had no sooner opened their mouths against Moses, but the earth opened her mouth to swallow them up quicke: of Achan, who had no sooner devoured the accursed thing, but it was drawne out of his belly with bowels, heart and all: of Herod, who had no sooner heard the people cry, The voice of God and not of man, but hee felt himselfe a worme and no man: of Zimri and Cozbi, who had no sooner received the dart of lust in their heart, than they felt a javelin in their bodies: of Ananias and Sapphira, who no soo∣ner kept backe part of the price for which they sold their possessions, but death seized upon them, and they gave up the ghost; and of ma∣ny others whose deaths wounds yet bleed afresh in sacred and profane stories. 2 Because there is nothing permanent of sinne but the end: the duration, if it have any, is very short, like to that of Jonahs gourd,Jonah 3.7. which rose up in a night, and was eaten up with a worme in the morning. 3 Because nothing is so much to bee regarded in any thing as the end; for fines principia actionum, the end setteth the efficient on worke; and all is well that endeth well, as wee say in the Proverbe.Deut. 32.29. O that they were wise, saith God by Moses, then they would consider their latter end. If wee invert the speech, it will bee as true, O that men would consider their latter end, and then they would be wise. For assuredly he that in his serious con∣templation beginneth at the end of sinne, in his practise will end at the be∣ginning. To consider the end of sinne, is to take a survey of all the miseries and calamities incident to intelligent natures; of all the plagues that light upon the bodies, and soules, and estates of impenitent sinners in this life, with a fearfull expectation of hellish torments; then a violent separation of the soule from the body, which is no sooner made, but the soule is pre∣sented before the dreadfull Judge of quicke and dead, arraigned, condem∣ned, and immediately upon sentence haled and dragged by ugly fiends to the darke and lothsome dungeon of hell, there in all extremity of paines and tortures, without any ease or mitigation, to continue till the generall day of the worlds doom; when meeting again with the body, her companion in all filthinesse, iniquity, and ungodlinesse, they are both summoned to the last judgement, where all their open and secret sinnes are laid open to the view of men and Angels, to their inexpressible and astonishable confusion: after conviction the sentence, at which not the eares onely shall tingle, the teeth chatter, the knees smite one the other, but the heart also melt; the sentence, I say, of eternall damnation shall bee pronounced in their hea∣ring,Mat. 25.41. Goe ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Divell and his An∣gels. A most heavie sentence, never to bee recalled, and presently to bee put in execution, the Devill with reviling and insultation carrying them, with all their wicked friends and associates, to the place of endlesse tor∣ments,
to endure the full wrath of God, and the paines of everlasting fire. O what will it bee to feele the second death, which it is death to thinke or speake of! who can read the description thereof in SaintDe vit. con∣temp. l. 3. c. 12. Fieri patriae coelestis extor∣rem, mori vitae beatae, morti vivere sempi∣ternae, in aeter∣num cum dia∣bolo expelli, u∣bi sit mors se∣cunda damna∣tis exilium, vi∣ta supplicium: non sentire in illo igne quod illuminat, sen∣tire quod cru∣ciat; ineffica∣cis poenitentiae igne exuri, & consumentis conscientiae verme immor∣taliter rodi, in∣undantis in∣cendii terribi∣les crepitus pa∣ti, barathri fu∣mantis amarâ caligine oculos obscurari, pro∣fundo gehen∣nae fluctuantis mergi. Prosper with dry eyes? To bee banished for ever from our celestiall countrey, to bee dead to all joy and happinesse, and to live to eternall death; for ever to bee cast out with the Divell thither where the second death serveth for a banishment to the dam∣ned, and life for a torment, there to feele in that unquenchable fire the torment of heat, and not receive any comfort of light; to bee cruciated with heart bur∣ning sorrow, and uneffectuall repentance, to bee gnawne with the immortall worme of conscience, to frye perpetually in crackling flames, to have their eyes put out with the smoake of the river of brimstone, to be drowned floating in the bottome of hell. The end, &c. Understanding by end the finall effect, not the finall cause of sinne: by those things, all those things hee spake of before: and by death, that death which is opposed to eternall life; each of these words, Finis Ho∣rum Mors, yeeldeth a most wholesome and fruitfull observation: 1 That all sinfull courses and wayes have an end: Finis. 2 That all sins are mortall (of which before): Horum. 3 That eternall death of body and soule in hell, is the wa∣ges which the impenitent and obstinate sinner shall receive to the uttermost farthing: Mors. That all sinfull pleasures and delights have an end no man can doubt; for they cannot survive our life here, our life often surviveth them: and what is our life, butPind. . fumi umbra, the shadow of smoake, or dreame of a shadow? that is, lesse than nothing. Seneca out of his owne experience found honour to bee of the nature of glasse, quae cum splendet frangitur, which when it most glowes and glisteneth in the furnace, suddenly cracketh; and pleasure to bee like a sparke, quae cum accenditur extinguitur, which is quenched in the kindling. And surely all comforts and contentments of worldly men are like bubbles of soap blowne by children out of a wallnut-shell into the ayre, which flye a little while, and by the reflection of the sun beams make a glorious shew, but with a small puffe of winde are broken and dissolved to nothing. But alas it is not so with the paine of sin as it is with the pleasure, that is as lasting as the other is durelesse: Leve & momentaneum est quod de∣lectat, aeternum est quod cruciat; The delight of sinne is for a moment, but the torment remaineth for ever. Who will be content to fast all the weeke for one good meales meat? to lye in prison all the dayes of his life for one houres liberty and jollity? These similitudes fall short, and reach not home to the representing of the sinners folly, who for swimming an houre in the bath of pleasure, incurreth the danger of boyling for ever in a river of brimstone, and torrent of fire: Momentaneum est quod delectat, aeternum est quod cruciat. Those things whereof yee are ashamed have an end, and how soone yee know not; but the death which is the end of them hath no end, and this wee know. That wee may more fully understand what is meant by this end, wee are to take notice of a double death: The first commonly called death temporall, The second which is death eternall.
Aug. de Civ. Dei. l. 21. Pri∣ma mors ani∣mam nolentem pellit de cor∣pore, secunda mors animam nolentem te∣net in corpore. Idem de Civ. Dei, l. 13. Pri∣ma mors bonis bona est, malis mala; secunda ut nullorum bonorum est, i∣ta nulli bona.The first death driveth the soule out of the body, being unwilling to part with it; the second death keepeth the soule against her will in the body: the first death is the separation of the soule from the body, the second death is the sepa∣ration of body and soule from God; and by how much God is more excellent than the soule, by so much the second death is worse than the first. The first death is good to good men, because it endeth their sorrowes, and beginneth their joyes; but evill to evill men, because it ends their joyes, and beginneth their e∣verlasting weeping and gnashing of teeth: the second at it belongeth to none that are good, so it is good to none. Both of these doubtlesse are due to sinne, and shall bee paid at their day: the sentence pronounced against Adam, mor∣te morieris, by the reduplication of the word seemeth to imply as much as thou shalt dye againe and againe, the first and second death; the first death is as the earnest-penny, the second as the whole hire, both make up the wages of sinne: the first is like the splitting of the ship, and casting away all the goods and wares; the latter as the burning both, with unquenchable fire. In this death which is the destruction of nature, that Maxime of Philoso∣phy holdeth not, Omnis corruptio est in instanti: for here is corruption in time, nay, which is more strange, and to the reason of the naturall man in∣volveth contradiction, Corruptio aeterna, & mors immortalis, an eternall corruption, and an immortall death.Aug. loc sup. Nemo hic propriè mori∣ens, seu in morte dicitur, sed ante morté aut post mor∣tem, id est, vi∣ventes aut mortui: ibi è contrariò, non erunt homines ante mortem, aut post mor∣tem, sed sine fi∣ne morientes; & nunquam pejus erit ho∣mini in morte, quam ubi erit mors ipsa sine morte. In this life men cannot properly bee said to bee dying, or in death, but alive or dead: for whilest the soule re∣maineth in the body wee are living, and after the separation thereof wee are dead: whereas they that are in hell cannot bee said properly to bee dead, be∣cause they are most sensible of pain; nor to be alive, because they suffer the pu∣nishment of the second death; but continually dying, and never shall it be worse with man in death, than where death it selfe is without death, where life perpe∣tually dyeth, and death perpetually liveth. SaintGreg. l. 9. moral. c. 45. Gregory sweetly quave∣reth upon this sad note; Mors sine morte, finis sine fine, defectus fine defectu, quia & mors vivit, & finis incipit, & deficere nescit defectus: The death of the damned is a deathlesse death, an endlesse end, and undefcizible defect; for their death alwayes liveth, and their end beginneth, and their consumption la∣steth. And that this death is meant in my text either only or especially, the cor∣respondencie of this member to that which followeth, but the gift of God is eternall life, maketh it manifest. Yet for further confirmation hereof, that the wages of sinne is eternall death, I will produce manifold testimonies of Scripture beyond all exception, not so much to convinceAug. l. 22 de Civ Dei. Ori∣gines eò erravit deformiùs quò sensit cle∣mentiùs. the errour of O∣rigen, who was of opinion that all the damned, yea the Devils themselves, should in the end bee released of their torments; as to settle a doubt which troubleth the mindes of the godly, how it should bee just with God to in∣flict eternall punishments upon men for temporall transgressions. For your better satisfaction herein, may it please you to take notice of two opinions concerning the rule of justice and goodnesse: the first ma∣keth the will of God the rule of good, the latter goodnesse the rule of Gods will. If yee embrace the former opinion, to prove that it is just to re∣pay eternall punishments to temporary and finite offences, it will bee sufficient to shew that it is Gods will and good pleasure so to doe: if yee encline to the latter opinion, it will bee farther requisite to shew the con∣gruity of such proceedings with the principles of reason, and rules of ju∣stice
among men. It is very reasonable to thinke that God hath alwayes a reason for his will, yet it is safest for us to take his will for a reason. For God cannot will any thing, but as hee willeth it, it is just and good: and that it is Gods will and decree to torment them eternally who dye impenitently, ap∣peareth by the words of our Saviour;Mat. 25.46. These shall go into everlasting pain: and of Saint2 Thes. 1.9. Paul, These shall bee punished with everlasting perdition, from the presence of the Lord, and glory of his power: and of SaintApoc 20.10 John, And the Devill that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false Prophet shall bee tormented day and night for evermore. Thus much of the torments in generall; in speciall, that the fire is un∣quenchable wee reade in SaintMat. 3.11. Matthew, The chaffe hee will burne with un∣quenchable fire: and in SaintJude 7. Jude, Which suffer the vengeance of eternall fire. How should the fire ever goe out, sith as the Prophet Esay informeth us,Isa. 30.33. The breath of the Lord, like a river of brimstone, continually kindleth it? And that the worm likewise is immortall Christ teacheth,Mar. 9.44, 46, 48. Where the worm, saith he, never dyeth, and the fire is not quenched: and that the darknesse like∣wise is perpetuall wee heare out of Saint Peter,2 Pet. 2.17. They are Wells without wa∣ter, clouds carryed about with a tempest, to whom blacke darknesse is reserved for ever: yea the chaines of this prison wherewith the damned are mana∣cled and fettered, are everlasting: for the Angels that kept not their first estate, saith Saint Jude,Jude 6. God hath reserved in everlasting chaines under darknesse, unto the judgement of the great day: and lastly, TheApoc. 14.11. fume and the stench of the brimstone lake riseth up perpetually, and the smoake of their tor∣ment shall ascend for evermore. Neither can it bee answered in behalfe or comfort of the damned, that indeed hell torments shall still endure, but that they shall not be alwayes in durance; that the racke shall remaine, but they shall not bee everlastingly tortured on it; that the Jaile shall stand, but that the prisoners shall not alwayes be kept in it: for the Scipture is as expresse for the reprobates enduring, as for the during of those paines: They shall goe, saith Christ,Mat. 25.46. into everlasting fire:2 Thes. 1.9. They shall suffer, saith Saint Paul, the paines of everlasting perdition:Apoc. 20.10. They shall bee tormented, saith Saint John, with fire and brimstone for evermore: and therefore the fire is calledMar. 9.44. their fire, ignis eorum, because it burneth them; and the worme their worme, because it feedeth upon them; and the torments their torments, be∣cause they paine and torture them. These texts are so plaine, that Cardinal Bellarmine himselfe professedly refuteth those of his owne side, who give credit to the legend, which relateth that by the prayers of Saint Gregory the soule of Trajan was delivered out of hell. The good will and pleasure of God concerning the condition of the damned being thus made knowne un∣to us, wee are to tremble at his judgements, and quell and keepe under eve∣ry thought that mutines against them. To call Gods justice in question con∣cerning the everlasting torments of the damned, is to bring our selves in danger of them. Are not Gods actions just because wee see not the squire by which they are regulated?Aug. l. 2. de Civ. Dei. Cu∣jus plenè judi∣cia nemo com∣prehendit, ne∣mo justè repre∣hendit. though wee cannot comprehend all Gods judge∣ments, yet wee may not reprehend any: Multa Dei judicia occulta sunt, nul∣la injusta, many judgements of God are secret, none unjust. In particular, con∣cerning this point much hath and may bee said in justification of Gods pro∣ceeding with the damned, even by humane reason.
1. Saint Austine rightly observeth, that in punishing offences we are not so much to regard the time, as the quality; the duration, as the enormity. A man justly lyeth by it the whole yeere for a rash word spoken in a moment: another is condemned to the Gallies all his life for a murder or a rape com∣mitted on the sudden in hot bloud; therefore howsoever the sins of the re∣probate are but temporall, yet the circumstances of them may be so odious, and the number of them so great, and the nature so hainous, that they may deserve eternall punishments. 2. Where the guilt still remaineth, it is not against justice that the party still suffer: but in the soules of all infidels and impenitent sinners, whose con∣sciences were never washed, neither in the salt water of their owne teares, nor in the sweet laver of regeneration, the guilt of all their sinnes still re∣maineth; and therefore justly they may be eternally punished for them. 3. An impenitent sinner, if he should alwayes live upon the earth, would alwayes hold on his sinfull course; and that he breaketh it off at his death it is no thanke to him: had he still the use of his tongue, he would still blas∣pheme and curse: had he still the use of his eyes, hee would still looke after vanity: had hee still the use of his feet, hee would still walke in crooked wayes: had he still the use of his hands, he would still worke all manner of wickednesse: had hee still the free use of all the faculties of his soule, and members of his body, he would still make them weapons of unrighteousnes. Inchinus theInchin. lib. de 4 Novis. Romish Postillar giveth some light to this truth by an inch of candle, whereby two play at tables in the night, and are very earnest at their game; but in the midst of it the candle goeth out, & they perforce give over, who (no doubt) if the light had lasted, would have played all night. This inch of candle is the time of life allotted to a wicked man, who is re∣solved to spend it all in sinfull pleasures and pastimes: and if it would last perpetually, he would never leave his play: and therefore sith he would sin eternally, though by reason that the light of his life goeth out hee cannot, he deserveth eternall punishment. 4. Though the sins of the reprobate are finite in respect of the time and the agents, yet (as they are committed against an infinite Majesty) the guilt of them is infinite. Here it will be objected, That if sinnes be infinite in any respect, they must needs be all equall, because infinity admitteth no degrees: nothing can be more or lesse infinite. I answer, that althoughCamp rat 8. Paradox. Campian and other Papists charge the reformed Churches with that absurd Paradoxe of the Stoickes, That all sinnes are equall: and consequently, that it is as great a wickednesse to kill a Capon to furnish a luxurious feast, as to kill a man: yet their heart cannot but smite them for so notorious a calumny: for they themselves teach, That mortall sinnes, as they are committed against God, are of infinite guilt, and deserve infinite and eternall punishments; and yet they hold not, that all mortall sinnes are equall, their Casuists teaching, that parricide is a greater sinne than murder, incest than adultery, blasphe∣my than perjury: all of them being mortall. As for the knot of the former objection, it is thus easily untyed, That sinnes may be considered either in a genericall notion, as they are breaches of the eternall Law, & offend an infi∣nite Majesty; in which respect as they are infinite, so they are equall: or in
a specificall reason, as they are of this or that kind clothed with such & such circumstances, as they are breaches of the first or second Table, as they are committed immediately against God, or mediately, once or often, on the sudden or unadvisedly, ignorantly or wilfully, out of infirmity or pre∣sumptuously, tending much or little to the hurt or prejudice of our neigh∣bour: In all which and divers like respects, the guilt of sinne is improved or diminished, and one sinne is more hainous and lesse pardonable than an∣other. We have said enough to these words for their coherence, sense, and con∣struction: let us now see what they say to us for our further use and in∣struction. There is no physicke, but if it worke maketh the patient sicker for the present; and for the most part the smarting plaister most speedily cureth the wound. These observations are true in corporall physicke, and much more in spirituall, because the smart of sinne, and trouble of consci∣ence for it, are not so much signes and symptomes of maladies, as the be∣ginning of cures. Some say, the feare of the plague bringeth it; but if we speake of this plague, and other judgements of God for sinne, it is certaine, that the feare of them is the best preservative against them: he onely may be secure of the avoiding Hell torments, and escaping the pangs of eternall death, who feareth them as he ought; and he that feareth them not, is in a most fearfull case. OEcclus. 41.1. death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee! It was spoken of the first death, but may with greater reason of the second: some tastes whereof I wil give you at this present, as well to make you loath the morsels of Sathan, as the better to rellish the fruits of the tree of life. The first shall be out of Saint Matthew,Mat. 25.10. Clausae sunt fores, the doores were shut: Conceive ye that to be now, which, if ye prevent it not, certainly shall be, that after ye have heard the Archangel sound the last Trump, and with him a Quire of heavenly spirits singing an Epithalamium or marriage song, ye should see the gates of Heaven opened, and the Sonne of man marching out of them with an innumerable company of Angels, presently sent abroad to gather the Elect from the foure windes, and soone after infinite troupes of them assembled from all parts in goodly order and glorious armour, accom∣panying our Saviour in his triumphant returne into heaven, to receive each of them a crowne of glory, and you caught up into the clouds, pressing hard after them to enter with them into heaven, should be presently stayed, and the gates shut against you and fastened with everlasting barres: O! what a corrasive would this be? what a disgrace? what an unspeakable griefe, to have a glimpse of the celestiall Jerusalem, and to be excluded for ever out of it? to see those whom ye sometimes scorned, reviled, and trod under foot, admitted into Christs Kingdome before your face, and you repelled with a non novivos, Away from mee, I know you not? Have ye enough of this taste? or doe ye yet desire a second? ye have it in Saint Matthew,Mat. 25.30. Projicite in tenebras exteriores, Cast the unprofitable servant into utter darknesse, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Sup∣pose ye were stripped stark naked, and then bound hand and foot with iron chaines, and throwne into a deep, darke, loathsome, and hideous dungeon, full of Adders, Vipers, Basiliskes, and Scorpions, hissing, croaking, biting, stinging you in all parts of your body, you being not able to stirre a joynt, or
make any resistance at all. Are yee affrighted at this? The torment of the damned is farre worse: for the stinging of Serpents is nothing to the tormenting with Divels; nor the darknesse of a dungeon to the horrour of Hell. For though there be fire there, yet it yeeldeth no comfortable light: but as the flame in the bush had theExod. 3.2. light of fire, yet not the consuming heat; so on the contrary, the flames of Hell have the scorching heat, but not the comfortable light of fire. As ye like this, take another taste:Mar. 9.44. Vermis eorum non interit. Imagine that whilest ye lye in the darke dungeon bit & stung in your outward parts, there should be a venemous worme within your bowels, gnawing at your very heart; and upon remembrance of every hainous sinne, giving you a deadly bite: what paine and torment might this be? yet it is nothing to that which Christ there addeth, Ignis eorum non extinguitur, Their fire is not quenched. There is none such a blocke, but apprehendeth what unsufferable paine it is to lye soultering in the fire, or boyling in a river of brimstone, or frying in the flames of a furnace, and crying but for one drop of water to coole the tip of the tongue, and not obtaining it. If these tastes affect you not, take you yet a fourth, made of the very gall of Aspes,Apoc. 20.10. They shall be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, and shall be tor∣mented for e∣ver and ever. Non habebunt requiem die vel nocte, sed cruciabuntur inaeter∣nùm. Each of the former torments is of it selfe intolerable, and all of them most insufferable; yet all must bee endured without all meanes of ease, or hope of release: the banishment is perpetuall, the chaines everlasting, the worme immortall, the fire unquenchable. No losse so great as of the King∣dome of Heaven, no prison so loathsome as the dungeon of Hell, no sight so gastly as of the ougly fiends, no shreeking so lamentable as of damned ghosts, no stench so loathsome as of the lake of brimstone, no worme so biting as the remorse of conscience, no fire so hot as the wrath of God; but such losses never to be recovered, such chaines never to bee loosed, such darknesse never to be enlightened, such sights never to be removed, such noyse never to be stilled, such fumes never to be dispelled, such a worme never to be pluckt off, such fire never to be quenched, such torments never to be released, such misery never to be ended, maketh up such a punishment, as exceedeth all humane eloquence to expresse, & patience to endure. What shall I say more? Who of us is able to hold out long with a vehement fit of a burning feaver, or colicke, or stone, though lying in a sweet roome upon a soft bed, having the best meanes of physicke to mitigate the paine, and comfort of friends to strengthen our patience? If the Physician should tell us, that after a moneth or a yeere we should be out of our extreme fits, he would be so farre from chearing us up, that hee would neere drive us to de∣spaire: how then shall wee bee able to endure the scorching flames of the brimstone lake in the darke dungeon of Hell, where we have no other com∣forters about us than insulting Divels, or perhaps some of our dearest friends and kinred tormented with us? Yet if these paines lasted but for a yeere, or an age, or a thousand yeeres, or the duration of the world; though so great misery could admit of no possible comfort, yet there might bee some hope: but now after many ages and millions of yeeres spent in this in∣sufferable torment, to endure as many more, and againe as many more, and after all this to be nothing neerer to the end, than at the first day of their en∣trance
into that place of durance: O this is able to breake an heart even as hard as Adamant. Happy are we, that we have time to think on, and means to prevent these endlesse paines, for which the damned soules would give a thousand lives if they had them; & for their neglect thereof while the time served them, they now pierce their hearts, and rend their soules with these and the like lamentations: Woe worth our brutish sottishnesse, and beast∣ly folly, whereby for painted shewes and vanishing shadowes of sinfull pleasures, we have forgone everlasting joyes, and the glory of a celestiall Kingdome: O that we should be so retchlesse, as never to fore-thinke of the wretchednesse we are now come to: O that wee should refuse the meanes freely offered unto us to escape these torments, for which wee would now give the price of our dearest hearts bloud: O that we might be released but for a while out of these torments. If we might returne to life againe, what would we not doe, what would we not suffer, that we might not come to this dismall place? But alas, all is too late, the irrevo∣cable sentence is pronounced, the time of repentance is past; but the time of our sorrow shall never passe. All our prayers are now fruitlesse, our complaints bootlesse, our mourning regardlesse, our griefe remedilesse, our woe comfortlesse, our torments endlesse. If the consideration of these things move us not, beloved brethren, we beleeve them not; if we beleeve them not, we are not what we professe to be, that is, Christians. If there be no such torments in Hell as I have in part described, then (which to thinke, and much more to utter, deserveth a thousand Hells) there is no truth in the Gospel, upon the expresse Text whereof I have all this while enlarged my selfe. Nay, yet further, I shall be able to demonstrate unto you, that if ye beleeve there is no Hell, that ye are no men, because ye have no conscience. There is no conscience, if no religion; no religion, if no God; no God, if no providence; no providence, if no justice; no justice, if no torments to be endured after this life by them who have violated all humane and divine lawes, and received no condigne punishment in this world. Nature hath given us an image of Hell in Aetna, and other hills that continually burne; and of the damned, in the Salamander and Pyrausts that live in the fire. The ancient Grecians and Romans, yea, the Barbarous In∣dians, that have no learning among them, yet acknowledge a kind of Hell; so witnesseth the Relator of theHist. Virgin. Animae im∣mortalitatem agnoscunt, eamque putant post mortem pro meritis transferri, aut ad deorum se∣des, aut ad in∣gentem sero. bem igne ar∣dentem Popo∣gusso dictam, quam in extre∣mis mundi partibus sitam ex itimant. Virginia voyage: The Virginians (saith he) acknowledge the immortality of soules, and they beleeve that after death, according to their desert, they are either translated from hence into the seats of the gods, or are carried to a huge ditch, burning with fire, called Popogusso. An evident argument, that God hath engraven the image of Hell so deep in mens consciences, to deterre them from ungodlinesse, that the Divell can∣not raze it cleane out, though he desireth nothing more. But I speake to Christians, with whom this reason alone is sufficient to enforce their assent. If there be no Hell, Christ descended not into it, nor triumphed over it. If no second death, Christ hath not redeemed us from it: But hee hath certainlyApoc. 20.6. redeemed all that beleeve, and have part in the first resurrection. Other things we beleeve, because they are so: this is un∣doubtedly so, if we beleeve it. O what an easie condition is this, to have our debts paid for us, if by faith we take the summe laid downe for our dis∣charge,
and tender it unto God, and be carefull to run into no more arrera∣ges? He is most worthy to lye in the prison of Hell till he pay the utter∣most farthing of his debts, who can have them paid for him upon so easie termes, and will not. Wee have looked long enough downe upon Hell and Death: let us now looke up to our Saviour, who triumphed over both. Let the sight of the one as much raise us up in hope, as of the other dejecteth us in feare: let the serious meditation upon the everlasting flames of Hell kindle in us an e∣verlasting hate of sinne, and love of our Saviour, who by his fasting hath famished the worme of conscience, that now it shall bite no more; and by his bloud hath quenched the unquenchable fire in such sort, that it hath no power upon any of the members of his mysticall body: and by his tempo∣rall death hath delivered all that are his from eternall. Shall wee not then eternally sing his praises, who hath saved us from everlasting weeping and mourning in the valley of Hinnom? Shall any waters of affliction quench in us the love of him, who for us quenched unquenchable fire? Shall not the benefit of our delivery from everlasting death ever live in our memory? Shall any thing sever us from him, who for our sakes after a sort was seve∣red from his Father, when he cryed,Mat. 27.46. My God, my God, why hast thou forsa∣ken mee? Shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or the sword? No, I am perswaded I may goe on with the Apostle, and say,Rom. 8 38, 39. Nei∣ther life, nor death, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. To whom, &c.
FERULA PATERNA. THE XLVI. SERMON. REV. 3.19. As many as I love I rebuke and chasten. Right Honourable, &c. HOw unwilling the author of life and Saviour of all men, especially beleevers, is to pronounce and execute the sen∣tence of death and destruction against any, if the teares which hee shed over Jerusalem, and groanes and lamen∣tations which hee powreth out when he powreth forth the vials of his vengeance, testifie not abundantly; yet his soft pace, and orderly proceeding by degrees in the course hee taketh against obstinate and impenitent sinners, is enough to si∣lence all murmuring complaints wrongfully charging his justice, and raise up all dejected spirits dolefully imploring his mercy. For hee ever first sit∣teth upon his throne of grace, and reacheth out his golden Scepter to all that cast themselves downe before him (and if they have a hand of faith to lay hold on it, hee raiseth them up) before hee taketh hold of his iron rod; and hee shaketh it too before hee striketh with it, and hee striketh lightly before hee breaketh in pieces and shivers, the vessels of wrath fitted to de∣struction. So true is that which hee speaketh of himselfe by the Prophet Hosea,Hos. 13.9. O Israel thou hast destroyed thy selfe, but in mee is thy helpe: and the Prophet of him,Psal. 25.10. All the pathes of the Lord are mercy and truth; in which he walketh thus step by step. First, when wee begin to stray from him, hee calleth us backe, and re∣claymeth us from our soule and dangerous wayes, by friendly counsels and passionate perswasions, by increase of temporall and promise of eternall
blessings: as we may read in the tenour of all the Prophets commissions. 2 If these kinde offers be refused with contempt, and greater benefits repayed with greater unthankfulnesse, he changeth his note, but not his af∣fections; he exprobrates to us our unthankfulnesse, that it might not prove a barre of his bounty:Hos. 11, 3, 4. I taught Ephraim to goe, taking them by their armes, and they knew not that I healed them, I drew them with the cords of a man, with bands of love, and I was to them as they that take off the yoake from their jawes. and,Isa. 5.2. My Beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitfull hill, and hee fenced it, and hee gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest Vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine∣presse therein, and hee looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. 3 If exprobrations and sharpe reproofes will not serve the turne, he falls to threatning and menacing fearefull punishments, but to this end onely, that hee may not inflict what hee threateneth, as wee see in Niniveh's case,Jonah 3.4. Yet forty dayes, saith the Prophet, and Niniveh shall bee overthrowne: yet Niniveh was not overthrown;Vers. 10. because the Ninivites repented of their workes, and turned from their evill wayes, God repented of the evill he had said that hee would doe unto them, and he did it not. 4 If neither promises of mercies, nor threats of judgements; neither kind entreaties, nor sharpe rebukes can worke upon the hard heartednesse of ob∣stinate sinners, hee useth yet another meanes to bring them home; hee ta∣keth away their goods that they may come to him for them; hee pincheth them with famine, that hee may starve their wanton lusts; he striketh their flesh with a smart rod, that it may awake their soules out of a dead sleepe of security: and this for the most part is the last knocke at their hearts, at which if they open not, and receive Christ by unfained repentance and a lively faith, the gates of mercy are for ever locked up against them. According to this method Christ here proceedeth with the Angel of La∣odicea: First,V. 15. hee friendly saluteth him: next,V. 16. Ver. 17. Ver. 18. hee sharply reproveth him: then hee fearfully threatneth him: lastly, he severely chastiseth him, and all in love, as you heare in this verse, (As many as I love I rebuke and chasten). Which hath this coherence with the former, wherein Christ taxed two vices in this Angel, luke warmnesse, and spirituall pride; against these hee prescribeth two remedies, zeale, vers. 19. and spirituall provi∣dence: I counsell thee to buy of mee gold tryed in the fire, that thou maist bee rich; and white rayment that thou maist bee clothed, and that the shame of thy nakednesse doe not appeare; and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve that thou maist see. But here because the Angel of Laodicea might reply, Alas, to what end is all this? what prescribe you unto memedicinal potions, who am to be spewed out of Gods mouth? what can your counsell doe me good? my doome is al∣ready past, and my heart within mee is like melted waxe: Christ oppor∣tunely in the words of my text solveth this objection, and giveth him a cor∣dial to keep him from fainting; Be not too much discouraged at my sharp re∣bukes, nor faint under my fatherly chastisements: for I use no other discipline towards thee than towards my dearest children, whom I love most entirely, & yet rebuke most sharply to break them of their ill qualities. I chasten those,
and those onely, and all those whom I love; and I chasten oftenest whom I love best: wherefore faint not, but be zealous; neither despaire, but amend, and thou shalt finde my affection as much enlarged, and the treasurie of my bounty as open unto thee as ever heretofore. Behold then in the words of this Scripture, 1 A rule of direction to those that are set in high places of au∣thority. 2 A staffe of comfort to those who are fallen into the depth of griefe and misery. To the former the Spirit speaketh in the words of my text on this wise. Ye Masters of servants, Tutors of Scholars, Fathers of children, Ma∣gistrates of cities, and Kings of realmes, who have received your autho∣rity from God, bee ruled by him by whom yee rule, take him for a presi∣dent in your proceedings from whom yee have your warrant: hee first convinceth, then reproveth, after threatneth, and lastly chastiseth those, & all those whom he loveth: doe yee likewise, first evidently convince, then openly rebuke, after severely threaten, and last of all fatherly chasten with moderation and compassion all those, indifferently, without partiality, who deserve chastisement, not sparing those who are most deare and neare unto you. But to the bruised reed, to the drouping conscience overwhelmed with sorrow and griefe both for sinnes and the punishment thereof, the Spirit speaketh in the words of my text on this wise. Why doe yee adde affli∣ction to your affliction, and fret and exulcerate your own wounds through your impatience? It is not (as yee conceive) your enemy that hath pre∣vailed against you; it is not a curst Master, or a racking Land-lord, or a partiall Magistrate, or an envious neighbour that wreakes his spleene and malice upon you; but it is your heavenly Father that striketh you, and he strikes you but gently, and with a small ferular; neither offereth hee you any harder measure than the rest of his children, so hee nurtureth them all. Neither are yee cast quite out of favour, though cast downe for the present; nay, bee it spoken for your great comfort, yee are no lesse in favour than when your estate was entire which now is broken, and your day cleerest which is now overcast. Yee are so farre from being utterly rejected and abandoned by your heavenly father, that yee are by this your seasonable affliction more assured of his care over you, and love un∣to you. For hee never saith, As many as I love I smile upon, or I winke at their faults, but, I rebuke and chasten: whom hee lesse careth for hee suffe∣reth to play the trivants, and take their pleasure; but hee nurtureth and correcteth you whom hee intendeth to make his heires, yea joint heires with his best beloved Christ Jesus. Therefore submit your souls under his mighty hand in humble patience, & after that raise them up in a comforta∣ble hope, kisse his rod, quae corpus vulnerat, mentem sanat, which woundeth the body, but healeth the soule; makes the flesh peradventure blacke and blew, but the spirit faire and beautifull. Arguite & castigate vos ipsos, con∣vince your owne folly, rebuke your bad courses, chasten your wanton flesh with watching, fasting and other exercises of mortification; con∣fesse your faults, and grieve not so much because yee are stricken, as that
ye should deserve to bee so stricken by him: then will the affection of a father so worke with him, that hee will breake his ferular, and burne his rod wherewith hee hath beaten you, and the overflowing of his future favours will make it evident, that whatsoever was said or done before, was in love, to make you partakers of his holinesse, and more capable of celestiall happinesse. Wherefore let all that mourne in Zion, and sigh as often as they breath for their many and grievous visitations, heare what the Spirit saith to the Angel of Laodicea, I rebuke and chasten as many as I love. Spices pounded and beaten small smell most sweetly; and Texts of Scrip∣ture yeeld a most fragrant savour of life, when they are expounded and bro∣ken into parts; which are here evidently foure: 1 The person of Christ, I. 2 The actions of this person, Rebuke and chasten. 3 The subject of these actions, As many. 4 The extent of the subject, As I love. 1 The person most gracious, I. 2 The actions most just, Rebuke and chasten. 3 The subject most remarkable, Whom I love. 4 The extent most large, As many. 1 In the person you may see the author of all afflictions. 2 In the actions, the nature of all afflictions. 3 In the extent, the community of all afflictions. 4 In the subject, the cause of all afflictions. Of this extent of the subject, subject of the actions, actions of Christ, by his gracious assistance, and your Christian patience: and first of the per∣son, 1. That in all afflictions of the servants of God, God is the principall a∣gent, and hathIsa. 45.7. I make peace, & create evill. the greatest stroake, needeth not so much evident demon∣stration, as serious consideration, and right and seasonable application in time of fearfull visitations. For what passage can wee light upon at all ad∣ventures, especially in the writings of the Prophets, where wee finde not either God threatning, or the Church bewailing afflictions, and sore cha∣stisements?Amos 3.6. Is there any evill in the city which I have not done, saith the Lord? And,Lam. 1.12. Is there any sorrow like unto my sorrow, wherewith the Lord hath affli∣cted mee in the day of his fierce wrath, saith his captive Spouse? What face of misery so ugly and gastly, wherewith hee scareth not his disobedient people? To them that have hard hearts, and brazen browes that cannot blush, hee threaneth to makeLev. 26.19. the earth as iron, and the heaven as brasse: hee martials all his plagues against them, sword, famine, pestilence, stings of serpents, teeth of wilde beasts, blasting, mildew, botches, blaines, and what not? And according as he threatneth in the law, he professeth that he had done to the Israelites in the dayes of the Prophet Amos:Amos 4.6.7, 8, 9, 10. I have sent you cleannesse of teeth, and scarcity of bread in all your coasts, and yet yee have not returned unto mee: also I have withholden the raine from you, and yet yee have not returned. I have smitten you with blasting and mildew; your gar∣dens and vineyards the valmer-worme hath devoured, and yet yee have not re∣turned unto mee. Pestilence I have sent you, after the manner of the Egyptians,
and your young men I have slaine with the sword, and yet yee have not retur∣ned unto mee. I have overthrowne you as God overthrew Sodome and Gomor∣rah, and you were as a fire-brand out of the burning, and yet yee have not re∣turned unto mee. There being a double evill as the Schooles distinguish, Malum 1. Culpae. 2. Poenae. the evill of sin, and the evill of punishment: to make him the author of the former, and to deny him to be the author of the later, is a like impiety. For the former errour impeacheth his purity & sanctity, the later his justice and providence. It is true, that in the afflicting of his children, God sometimes useth none of the bestJob 1.2. 2 Cor. 12.7. Hieron. lib. de vir. illustr. in Ignat. De Sy∣ria ad Romam pugno, ad be∣stias in mari & in terrà, liga∣tus cum 12. Leopardis, hoc est, militi∣bus qui me cu∣stodiunt, qui∣bus si benefe∣ceris pejores sunt, iniquitas eorum mea doctrina est. instruments, neither do they intend what God doth in laying heavie crosses upon his children: yet he keepeth their malice within such compass, that they can do nothing, but what God for just causes permits them to doe. God hath Sathan and all his instruments like Mastiffs tyed in a chain, they cannot go beyond their tether; he letteth them loose, and calls them in at his pleasure. If God be at peace with us,Psal. 34.20. not a bone shalbe broken: nay, not aMat. 10.30. haire of our head shall fall. The foure Angels in theApoc. 7.3. Apocalypse had not power to touch the earth, or any tree, till Gods servants were sealed. If this be so, what security doth the feare of God bring to man! and what a Potentate is the feeblest Christian on earth! Qui Deum timet, omnia timent eum; qui Deum non timet, timet omnia: He which feareth not God, hath cause to feare all things; for all the creatures will take their Makers part against him: on the contrary, hee that feareth God, all things feare him; for nothing dares or can doe him hurt. Surely no Prince or Empe∣rour could ever so secure his state, or guard his person, that neither outward power could annoy him, nor home-bred treachery surprise him: yet neither rebell, nor pyrate, nor rich, nor poore, nor open enemy, nor counterfeit friend, nor principality, nor power, nor man, nor divell can touch Gods children, protected by his omnipotency, and guarded by his holy Angels, except they turne rebels to God, and traitours to themselves. For no evill can come neere them, while God is neere them; and God will be ever neer them, if they depart not from him. 2. Hath God a hand in all the stroakes of his children? let us not then so much fret and fume at the immediate agents, or rather instruments, as wee doe. It is all one, as if a Noble man sentenced by the King or his Peeres to lose his head, should fall foule upon the Heads-man, or pick a quarrell with the axe: or as if a patient, to whom a wise Physician hath prescribed a bit∣ter potion for the recovery of his health, should fall out with the Apothe∣cary for ministring it: Nay, it is like to them that use the unguentum called Armarium, who when a party is wounded by his adversary with a sword or speare, apply nothing to the party, but annoint the instrument. I speake not this to justifie or excuse the malice, or iniquity, or cruelty of those in whose hands God putteth his scourge for us, if they exceed his prescript, and rather exercise their owne passions, than execute his judgements. For as God is no way accessary to their cruelty; so neither doe they participate of Gods righteousnesse in afflicting his children: and as God hath made them now instruments, so hee will hereafter make them subjects of his ju∣stice: as a tender mother, after she hath beat her infant, casteth the rod in
the fire; so God dealeth with these men. The Assyrians were his rod wherewith he chastened the Israelites; the Persians his rod wherewith he chastened the Assyrians; the Grecians his rod wherewith he chastened the Persians; the Romane Emperours the rod wherewith he chastened the Grecians: and now all foure rods one after another are cast into the fire. But my aime is to perswade you to looke higher than the executioners and ministers of Gods vengeance; and when ye see that hee sitteth in hea∣ven who ordereth and appointeth how many stroaks shall be given to you; who hath not only a glasse to keep every drop of bloud that is drawne from you, but also aPsal. 56.8. bottle to keep every teare that falls from your eyes, to struggle with the infirmity of your flesh, and endeavour to the uttermost of your power to suffer his will, because ye have not done it; & to make the best amends ye can, to supply the defect of your active obedience by your passive. Holy Job could discerne Gods arrowes, though in the hand of Sathan; and his hand, though on the armes of the Sabean robbers: and therefore when he was stript of all his goods, even by the worst of men, he curseth not the instruments, but blesseth God, saying:Job 1.21. Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked shall I returne thither again; the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord. What Christ spake to Pilate vaunting of the power and authority he had over him, the feeblest Christian in the world may reply to the greatest Potentate on earth:John 19.10, 11. Thou couldst have no power at all against me, unlesse it were given thee from above. Wicked and ungodly men may have a will of themselves to vexe, hurt, and persecute Gods children; yet power they can have none, so much as to take a haire from their head, unlesse it be given them from above by God, who can and doth sometimes execute his just judgements by unjust ministers; and though they intend evill and mischiefe against his ser∣vants, yet hee will turne it intoGen. 50.20. As for you, you thought e∣vill against me, but God tur∣ned it unto good. good to them, as he did to Joseph. Solinus writeth ofSolin. c. 20. Hypanis Scy∣thicorum am∣nium princeps haustu salu∣berrimus, dum in Exampeum inferatur, qui amnem suo vi∣tio vertit. Hypanis, that the water thereof is very bitter as it passeth through Exampeus, yet very sweet in the spring; so the cup of trembling, which is offered to the children of God, is often very bitter at the second hand, as it is ministred unto them by profane persons, haters, and despi∣sers of their graces: yet it is sweet at the first hand, as it is sent them downe from heaven. 3. Are the afflictions which befall Gods children in their bodies, soules, good name, or estates, darts shot from heaven? how then can they avoid them? what shall they doe in this case? Surely cast themselves on the ground, and hold up their buckler of faith, saying withJob 13.15. Job: Though hee slay mee, yet will I put my trust in him. And with thePsal. 44.17, 18, 19. Israelites, All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee: our heart is not turned backe, nei∣ther have our steps declined from thy way; though thou hast sore broken us in the place of Dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death. Or cast up our darts to heaven, that is, our ejaculatory prayers, asPsal. 38.1, 2, 9. David doth: O Lord, rebuke mee not in thy wrath, neither chasten mee in thy hot displeasure: for thine arrowes sticke fast in mee, and thine hand presseth mee sore. Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee. When a great Philosopher was taxed for not holding out his argument with Adrian the
Emperour, but presently giving up the bucklers, his apology for himselfe was, Is it not reason to yeeld to him, who hath thirty legions at his command? I am sure there is greater reason, whatsoever the cause may be in our ap∣prehension, absolutely to yeeld without further disputing, to him who hath more than thirty legions of Angels at his command, and all the crea∣tures in heaven and earth besides. There is no contesting with soveraignty, no resisting omnipotency, no striving with our Maker. The fish that is caught with the hooke, the more he jerkes and flings, the faster hold the hooke taketh on him: the harder a man kickes against the pricks, the deeper they enter into his heeles. An earthen pitcher the more forcibly it is dashed against an iron pot, the sooner it flies in pieces: in like manner, the more we contend against God and his judgements, the more we hurt, wound, and in the end destroy our selves. Wherefore let us not like dogges bite the stone, never looking upon him that flingeth it: but mark him who aimes at us, and hitteth us, and lay our hands on our mouth withPsal. 39.9. David, saying, I held my peace, because thou Lord hast done it. The Persian Nobles, asAnnot. in Tacit. Janus Gru∣terus reporteth, accounted it an exceeding great grace to be scourged by their Prince; and though it were painfull to them, yet they seemed much to rejoyce at it, thanking him that he would take paines with them, and minister correction unto them himselfe: and shall we not much more praise the divine Majesty, that hee vouchsafeth himselfe to chasten us for our good? The wounds of a friend are more welcome to us than the plaisters of an enemy: and a sicke patient, who will not endure a bitter potion offe∣red him by a Physician, yet oftentimes taketh it from the hands of his most endeared spouse, or a beloved friend: and shall not all Gods chil∣dren, sicke of too much prosperity, willingly take the bitter, yet most wholsome, potion of affliction from the hand of the Father of spirits? Saint Paul shall close up the doctrine: When1 Cor. 11.32. we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world: and Saint Peter the use:1 Pet. 4.19. Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their soules to him in well doing, as unto a faithfull Creatour. From the person I proceed to his actions, rebuke and chasten, not con∣demne and punish, ; verba virtutem non addunt, soft words make smart blowes neverthelesse felt: if the stroakes be as many, and infli∣cted with equall force, whether ye call it chastening or punishing, all is one to the poore patient. Indeed were there but a verball difference, and not a reall between punishing and chastening, this note would little better the musicke; but if ye look more narrowly into the words, ye shall find in them many and materiall differences. In punishing ye shall observe a Judge, in chastening a Father: in punishment a satisfying of justice, in chastisement a testifying of love: in punishment a compensation of desert, in chastise∣ment a mitigation of favour: in punishment a principall respect had to a for∣mer offence, in chastisement to future amendment. A Judge principally regardeth the wrong done to the law, and therefore proportioneth his punishment to the quality of the offence: but a father, whom not love of law and justice, but the law of love moveth and after a sort enforceth to do what he doth for his childes good, is contented with such correction, not as he deserveth for the fault he hath committed, but that which he hopeth
will serve for his amendment: Pro magno peccato parum supplicii satis est patri. In briefe, this word Castigo, I chasten, how much soever at the first it affrighteth us, yet it affordeth us this comfortable doctrine, That God as a father inflicteth with griefe and compassion, moderateth with mercy, and di∣recteth by providence all the stroakes that are laid upon his children. 1. He inflicteth with griefe and compassion: OHos. 6.4. Ephraim, what shall I doe unto thee? O Judah, how shall I entreat thee? my bowels erne within mee, and my repentings roll together: and, For theJer. 9.10. mountaines will I take up a wee∣ping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wildernesse a lamentation, be∣cause they are burnt up, so that none can passe through them, neither can men heare the voice of the cattell, both the fowle of the heavens, and the beast are fled, they are gone.Mic. 1.8, 9. I will waile and howle, I will goe stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the Dragons, and mourning as the Owles: for her wound is incurable. 2. He mitigateth with mercy his childrens payment, 1. In respect of time, 1. Indefinitely. 2. Definitely. 2. In respect of the grievousnesse of their stroakes. He mitigateth in respect of time indefinitely: In a littleEsa. 54, 7, 8. wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment; but with everlasting kindnesse will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer. For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercy will I gather thee: and, The God of all1 Pet. 5.10. grace, who hath called us into his eternall glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you. Sometimes he pre∣scribeth the definite time; as toGen. 41.1. Joseph for his imprisonment two yeers: to theJer. 25.11. They shall serve the King of Babel seventy yeeres. Jewes for their captivity seventy yeeres: toDan. 4.25. Nebuchadnezzar for his humiliation seven yeers: to theApoc. 2.10. Ye shall have tribulation ten dayes. Angel of Smyrna ten dayes. And as he mitigateth their sufferings in respect of the time, so also in respect of the grievousnesse of their punishment: The Lord hathPsa. 118.18 severely chastened mee, saith David, but he hath not given mee over unto death. God he is1 Cor. 10.13. faithfull, and will not suffer his children to be tempted above their strength. 3. He directeth by his providence and fatherly wisedome all the cros∣ses that are laid upon his children to speciall ends for their good: namely, to cure their dulnesse and stupidity, abate their pride, tame their wanton flesh, exercise their patience, enflame their devotion, try their love, weane their desires from this world, and breed in them a longing for the joyes of heaven, and fruits of Paradise. Prosperity flattereth the soule, but trouble and affliction play the parts of true friends: they rightly enforme us of the insufficiency of all worldly comforts, which leave us in our extremities, and can stand us in no stead at our greatest need. And therefore S. Bernard very well resembleth them to rotten stakes, flags, and bull-rushes, which men catch at that are in perill of drowning, hoping by them to scramble out of the water: but alas, it falleth out far otherwise; these help them not at all, nor beare them above water, but are drawne downe under water with them. This most serious lesson of the vanity of earthly delights & world∣ly comforts, we reade in many Texts of Scriptures, heare in divers Ser∣mons,
see in daily spectacles of men troubled in mind at their death: yet we never thoroughly apprehend it, till Gods rod hath imprinted it in our bodies and soules: then finding by our wofull experience, that earthly feli∣city is nothing but misery masked in gaudy shewes, and that all the wealth of the world, together with all carnall delights, cannot ease a burthened conscience, nor abate any whit of our paine, we begin to distaste them all, we grow out of love with this life, and entertaine death in our most serious thoughts. Here the eye of faith, enlightened by divine revelation, seeth beyond death the celestiall Paradise, & in it a chrystallApoc. 22.1, 2. river of the water of life, & by it a tree of life, which beares twelve sorts of fruits: and besides these a heavenly City, shining withApoc. 21.18, 19. streets of gold, and foundations of pearle and precious stones, the sight wherof leaveth an unspeakable delight in the soule, which sweetneth all temporall afflictions, and stirreth up in us an unspeaka∣ble desire of those solid comforts and substantiall joyes.Ramus in orat. Heliogabalus was wont to set before his parasites a banquet painted on cloth, or carved in wood, or cut in stone; and whatsoever hee fed upon in truth, they had drawne before them in pictures and images: such are the joyes and delights which the Divell & the World presenteth unto us, false, shadowie, & vaine. The true are to be found no where but in heaven, where those joyes are in substance, which we have here but in shadowes:Aug. confes. l. 2. c. 5. Forni∣catur anima, quae avertitur abs te, & quae∣rit extra te ea quae pura & li∣quida non in∣venit, nisi cùm redit ad te. pure, which we have here polluted: full, which we have here empty: sincere, which wee have here mixt: perpetually flourishing, which we have here conti∣nually fading: to these substantiall, full, pure, sincere, everlasting joyes, God bring us for his Son Jesus Christ his sake. Cui, &c.
THE NURTURE OF CHILDREN. THE XLVII. SERMON. APOC. 3.19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Right Honourable, &c. THat which Pliny writeth, and experience confirmeth concerning hony-combes, that the thinner and weaker ho∣ny runs out of them at the first, but the thickest and best is pressed & squeezed out of them at the last; we find for the most part in handling Texts of holy Scripture, com∣pared by the ProphetPsal. 19.10. David to hony-combs, the easier & more vulgar observations flow out of them upon the lightest touch, but we are to presse each phrase and circumstance before we can get out the thickest hony, the choicest and most usefull doctrines of in∣spired wisedome. The more we sucke these combes, the more we may, the hony proveth the sweeter, the combe the moister; and, which is nothing lesse to be admired, the spirituall taste is no way cloyed therewith. Where∣fore with your good liking and approbation, I will presse again and againe these mellifluous combes in our Saviours lips, dropping celestiall doctrine sweeter than hony, to delight the most distempered taste, and sharper than it, to cleanse the most putrefied sore. I rebuke and chasten; there is the sharpnesse, and as it were the searching vertue of hony: As many as I love, there is the sweetnesse. Parallel Texts of Scripture, like glasses set one against another, cast a mu∣tuall light: such is this Text, and that Deut. 8.5. Thou shalt also consider in thy heart, that as a man chasteneth his sonne, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee: and, Job 5.17. Despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: and, Prov. 3.11, 12. My sonne, despise not the chastening of the Lord, neither bee
weary of his correction: for whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth, even as a father doth the sonne in whom he delighteth: and, Hebr. 12.7. If yee endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sonnes: for what sonne is he whom the father chasteneth not? As a Musician often toucheth upon the sweetest note in his song, Paven or Galliard; so doth the holy Spirit upon this: and there∣fore we ought more especially to listen to it. For, 1. It convinceth the Papists, who over-value crosses and afflictions, ac∣counting the bearing of them satisfactions for sinnes. For with a like pride, whereby they cry up their actions to be meritorious, they would improve their passions to be workes satisfactory (by satisfactory intending such as make amends unto the justice of God) wherein they as much over-reach, as they supererogate, or rather superarrogate in the former. Satis∣factions to our brethren for wrongs done unto them, by restitution, mulct or acknowledgement of our fault, with asking forgivenesse for it, we both teach and practise: but they shall never be able to satisfie us in this point, that any thing they can doe or suffer, can satisfie God. Neither can our actions satisfie his law, nor our penall sufferings his justice: none can satis∣fie for sinne, but he that was without sinne: nothing can recompence an in∣finite transgression, but an infinite submission, or to speake more properly, the submission and passion of him that was infinite. It cost more to redeem sinnes than the world is worth: and therefore they must let that alone for him, whoEsay 63.3. trod the wine-presse alone. Before, I noted the difference between chastisement and punishment, in the one a compensation of wrong done to the person or law, is intended; in the other a testifying of love, and a care of amendment of the party chastened. Who would ever be so unreasona∣ble, as to thinke, that a few stripes given by a tender-hearted father to the childe whom he most dearly affecteth, were a satisfaction for the losse of a Diamond of great price? yet our sufferings hold not such a proportion. For what are our finite and momentary sufferings to the offence given to an infinite Majesty? Nothing can be set in the other scale against it to weigh it downe, but the manifold sufferings of an equall and infinite person, the e∣ternall Sonne of God. Neither will it help our adversaries any whit to say, that Christ satisfied for the eternall, but not for the temporall punishment of our sinnes. For this is all one as to say, that our Redeemer laid downe a talent of gold for us, yet not a brasse token: or payd many millions of pounds, yet not a piece. The Apostle said, hee gave himselfe a1 Tim. 2.6. ransome for all: will they deny it to be a sufficient one? or was there any defect in his good intention? They have not rubbed their foreheads so hard, as to af∣firme any such thing. Well then, let them tell us how that man is perfect∣ly ransomed by another, who is still kept in prison till he have discharged part of his ransome himselfe. This very conceit, that they merit by their actions, or satisfie by their passions, taketh away not only all merit, but all worth from them both. 2. It instructeth the penitent: for if afflictions are , discipline and nurture, then somewhat is to be learned by them. It is good for mee, saithPsal. 119.71. David, that I was in trouble, that I might learne thy statutes. Blessed is he, saith SaintGreg. mor. in Job c. 5. v. 17. Gregory, who is chastened of the Lord, Quia eruditur ad beati∣tudinem; because he is set in the right way to blessednesse. The Greekes
say in their Proverb, , and the Latines answer them both in the rime & reason, Nocumenta documenta, that is, we gain wit by our losses, and the rod imprinteth learning into us. What wee learne in particular by it, I shall God willing declare at large hereafter: this lesson shall suffice for the present, That as a loving father never beateth his child without a fault, so neither doth God chasten us without a cause: our sins are the cords which furnish his whip.Lam. 3.39. Man suffereth for his sinne. It is true that sinne is not the adaequate or onely cause for which God striketh his children, yet is it alwayes causa sine quâ non, a cause without which hee never striketh them.Joh. 9.3. Although neither the blind man his sinne, nor his fathers were the cause why hee was borne blind more than o∣ther men, but that through the miraculous cure of his blindnesse all might see the divine power of Christ; yet certaine it is that hee and his father for their sinnes deserved it or a greater punishment. Likewise Jobs sinnes were not the cause why the arrowes of the Almighty fell thicker upon him than any other, but it was to make him a rare mirrour of patience, and convince Satan of his false slander, and to take occasion of crowning him with greater blessings in this life, and everlastingly rewarding him hereafter; yet Job de∣nies not that those calamities fell justly upon him:Job 7.20. I have sinned, saith he, O Lord, what shall I doe unto thee, O thou preserver of men? 3 It comforteth all that are afflicted: there are as many arguments of comfort in it, as words of arguments. Is any man either impoverished with losses, or visited with sicknesse, or strucken with soares, or oppressed with heavie burdens, or pined with famine, or grieved with death of friends, or affrighted with terrours of conscience? let him lay this text of holy writ to his heart, and it will presently asswage his paine, and in the end, if not cure his malady, yet make it sufferable, yea and comfortable also to him. Let him thus question with himselfe: Who afflicteth me? It is answered, God, I. How proceedeth hee to afflict? After warning, and upon convicti∣on, , rebuke. What are afflictions? chastisements, and chasten. Whom doth he thus afflict? only some stubborn and obstinate sinners, or desperate cast-a-wayes? nay, but all his children, as many. Why afflicteth he? Because he loveth them. I. It is God that smiteth me, can I resist his power? must I not obey his will? Rebuke. Hee hath given me warning before, and I suffer but what I deserve: Quae venit ex merito poena ferenda venit. Chasten. Hee inflicteth with griefe, moderateth with love, guideth with fatherly providence what hee ordereth mee to suffer; shall I refuse nurture, and shew my selfe a bastard and no sonne? had I rather hee should leave me to my selfe, to follow my owne courses, according to the bent of my cor∣rupt nature, with a purpose to deprive mee of his glory, and dis-inherite me of his kingdome? As many. Hee disciplineth all his children, am I better than all the rest? As I love. His only motive herein is his love, and shal I take that ill which is sent to mee in love? shall I bee afraid of, and refuse love to∣kens? shall I bee grieved and dismaid because I have now more sensible ex∣perience of his care and love than ever before? To joyne all together, to make of them all a strong bulwarke against impatiency in all sorts of afflicti∣ons and tribulations: Shall wee either stubbornly refuse, or ungraciously
despise, or take unkindly after all faire meanes by us sleightened, the deser∣ved chastisement of our heavenly father, which with great moderation and greater griefe, he inflicteth upon all his deerest children in love? Can we just∣ly repine at any thing offered us upon these tearmes? is not this salve of the spirit alone of it selfe able to allay the most swelling tumour of the greatest hearts griefe? I rebuke and chasten as many as I love. Rebuke and chasten. So doth the Translatour render , tru∣ly and answerably to the main intent of the Spirit, but not fully and agreea∣bly to the nature of the letter: wee have no one English word capable of the whole contents of the two words in the originall. primarily signifieth to evict or convince, to give evidence of any thing or against any person, to lay his sinnes open before him, in such sort that hee cannot but see them, and bee ashamed of them; as in these passages,Heb. 11.1. ,Eph. 5.11. and, ,Psal. 50.21. Bud . and, : Faith is the evidence of things not seene; and, I will rebuke thee, and set thy sinnes in order before thy face; and, Have no fellowship with the unfruitfull workes of darknesse, but by the light of truth discover and openly rebuke them. Like∣wise  is a word much more pregnant than chasten; and, if you will have it in one word expressed, is, I nurture, or, I discipline: for the word implyeth as well instruction as correction. Now out of the nature of the phrase, which signifieth to rebuke upon conviction, or evidently convince by reproofe, and the order of the words, first rebuke, and then chasten, All Judges and Ministers of justice are lessoned to bee better instructed and in∣formed in the causes they sentence, than usually they are; to sift matters to the very bran, to weigh all circumstances together before they give judgement. For to reprove without cause deserveth reproofe, to censure without a fault deserveth censure, and to punish without conviction deserveth punishment.Fulgent. ad Monimum. Ip∣sa justitia, si puniendum re∣um non inve∣nerit, sed fece∣rit, injusta est. Punishing justice if it fall not upon a party legally convicted, is it selfe inju∣stice, and punishable in a Magistrate. Now that they who are in authority may not exercise injustice in stead of executing justice, 1 They must indifferently heare both parties. Philip kept an eare alwayes for the defendant:Orat. de co∣ron. in prooem. . Demosthenes in his famous oration for Ctesiphon, put∣teth the Athenian Judges in mind of this, which he calleth the first law of equity, to heare both the plaintiffe and defendant with indifferency. For asSenec. in Trag. Qui ali∣quid statuerit parte inauditâ alterâ, aequum licet statuerit, haud aequus est. Seneca saith truely, Hee that giveth a right judgement without hearing both parties, is no righteous Judge: and thereforeSuet. in Claud. Pro∣nunciabat saepè alterâ parte auditâ, saepè neutrâ. Suetonius justly chargeth Claudius with injustice, for precipitating his sentence before hee had gi∣ven a full hearing to both parties, nay sometimes to either. 2 They must lay all that they heare, and what is brought on both sides, in an even ballance, and poyse them together: Res cum re, causa cum causâ, ratio cum ratione concertet; by the collision of arguments on both sides the fire of truth is struck out. Protagoras his exception was good against them, who to prove the providence of their paynim gods, brought a number painted in a Table of them that calling upon them escaped shipwracke: At picti non sunt, inquit, qui naufragio perierunt; True, saith he, but none of those who notwithstanding their prayers to them suffered shipwracke, are any where painted, neither is there any register kept of them. 3 They must maturely advise, and seriously consider of the matter before they
passe sentence. The eye unlesse it bee fixed upon the object, cannot perfect∣ly discerne it, nor distinguish it from things that are neare and like unto it. And howsoever in a cleare water we may easily perceive any thing that is in the bottome, yet if it bee troubled wee cannot: and in every Court there are many troublers of the water, the Lawyers by their wrangling, and the witnesses by their varying, the Judges by their different opinions, (to speake nothing of Angels also troubling the cleere streame of justice at cer∣taine times.) 4 The eyes of their judgement must bee free from all mists of prejudice, and clouds of affection. For as that which a man looketh upon through red or greene glasse, seemeth to bee of that colour the glasse is of, though it bee of a far different, if not a contrary: so that which wee judge out of a forestal∣led conceit, or prejudicate opinion, seemeth to answer to our opinion of it, how contrary soever it bee. The Romane souldiers, asDiv. instit. l. 1. Lactantius noteth, thought verily that the goddesse worshipped at Syracuse, being demanded whether shee would bee carryed by them to Rome, answered, that shee would: not that the image spake any such word, but because they were before strongly perswaded that the goddesse would give such an answere. Unlesse those that sit in judgement observe these rules, they may easily take  for , a fallacy for a demonstration, and a malitious ca∣lumniation for a legall conviction. If their eyes be either dimme with pri∣vate affection, or blinded with rewards, or wink through carelesnesse, or are shut through wilfulnesse; that will fall out which S.L. 2. ep. 2. In∣ter leges ipsas delinquitur, in∣ter jura pecca∣tur, innocentia nec illic ubi de∣fenditur reser∣vatur, qui sedet crimina vindi∣caturus, admit∣tit; & ut reus innocens pere∣at, sit nocens judex. Cyprian so grievously complaineth of, Injustice sitteth in the place of justice, and even in the sight of the lawes, hanging about the judgement, seat the lawes are broken: the Judge who sitteth to revenge wrongs offered, offereth that which hee should revenge, and committeth that which hee should punish (and hath his conscience coloured with sinnes of a deeper dye than the scarlet of his robes.) The Empresse wisely advised her husband, when sitting at play, and minding (as it seemes) that more than the cause before him, hee rashly pronounced sentence; Non est vita hominum ludus talorum, The sitting upon life and death is not like the playing a game at Tables, where a Table-man of wood is taken up by a blot, and throwne aside without any great losse; the life of man is of more worth than so. Though all men detested Seianus, and that most deservedly, yet when they heard him adjudged to a most cruell and infamous death by no legall pro∣ceedings or course of justice, the hate of all men recoyled backe upon the Judges, and the people began to pity that great favourite, who before was most odious: Crepat ingens Seianus, great Seianus is drawn upon an hurdle, and hee suffereth for too much abusing his Princes favour. Juven. sat. 9.—Sed quo cecidit sub crimine? quisnam Delator? quibus indiciic? quo teste probavit? &c. Nil horum: Verbosa & grandis epistola venit A Capreis. Benè habet, nil plus interrogo.— What crime was laid to his charge? what evidence was given in against him? what witnesses were sworne? I heare of none: onely I heare of a long letter sent from the Emperour, taking his pastime at the Capreae. Hush, not
a word more. Who doth not observe in our owne Chronicles how God met to Hastings his owne measure, who the same day that the Earle Rivers, Gray, and others, in the reigne of Edward the fourth, without triall of law, were by his advice executed at Pomfret, had his head strucken off in the same manner in the Tower of London? Such as Tiberius his Judges, or Edward the fourth's, are no fit Presidents for Christian Magistrates; this  in my text will evidently convince them at Christs tribunall in the clouds, for not looking better to their evidence when they sate on the bench here below: let them therefore take judi∣cii praefidem for a president in their judgements, even God himselfe; who, as weeGen. 18.20. reade, though the sinne of Sodome were exceeding great, and the cry of it went up to heaven, yet came downe from heaven to see whether they had done according to that cry,Chrys. in Gen. before hee rained down fire and brimstone, to burn their bodies with unnaturall fire, whose soules burned with unnatu∣rall lust. As the word , I rebuke, rebuketh the carelesnesse & rashnesse of Jud∣ges and Magistrates, in giving sentence upon the life or state of any in que∣stion before them: so the other word, , I instruct by chastening, instru∣cteth fathers and mothers to performe that duty which they owe to God, and must performe to their children, viz. before them continually to re∣hearse the law of God,Deut. 11.19. & 4 10. To talke of it when they are in their house, and when they walke abroad, when they lye down, and when they rise up. Above all things they must take care to season their young and tender years with pure and in∣corrupt religion, and bring them up in the feare of God: otherwise they are but halfe parents, if they have not as well a care of their soules as of their bodies; if they pamper the flesh in them, but starve the spirit; if they labour not to bee Gods instruments for their eternall, as they have beene for their temporall life. DoubtlessePro. 1.8. Solomon, who injoineth children to heare their fathers instruction, and not to forsake the law of their mother, because they shall be as an ornament of grace unto their head, and chaines about their necke, im∣plieth in the duty of children to receive, the duety of parents to give them such instructions and lawes. What yeares fitter to lay the ground colour of vertue and true religion,Quint. in∣stit. orat. l. 1. c. 1 Sapor quo no∣va imbuis diu∣tissimè durat. Horat. ep. Quo semel est imbu∣ta recens serva∣bit odotem testa diu. Naturâ tena∣cissimi sumus eorum quae ru∣dibus annis imbibimus, nec lanarum colo∣res quibus sim∣plex ille can∣dor mutatus est, elui pos∣sunt. Quint. il. than those which are the more capable thereof, because as yet without any tincture at all? when better forming the mould of the heart and affections than when it is softest? and who rather to doe it than a father, whose workmanship next after God the child is? If it have a∣ny blemish or deformity of body, bee it a scar in the face, or stammering in the tongue, or wrinesse in the necke, or disproportion in any limbe, what will not a tender hearted parent doe to take away such a blemish, and rectifie such a distortion? All children are borne with worser defor∣mities in their soule than these imperfections are in their bodie, and yet how few parents take them to heart? Scarce one of an hundred attendeth up∣on Gods ordinance, and useth the meanes therein prescribed to cure the naturall blindnesse of ignorance, or to purge the dregges of con∣cupiscence in them, or to breake them of many ill customes and ha∣bites growing upon them. If children stammer out good words, or pronounce them lispingly, their fathers and mothers are offended at it, and rebuke them for it; but if they speake plainly and distinctly their
words, though they bee never so rotten and unsavoury, they make much of them for it: Verba ne Alexandrinis quidem permittenda de∣liciis, risu & osculo excipiunt. Hence it commeth to passe that they can speake ill before they can well speake, and drinke-in many vices with their mothers milke, and get such ill customes and habites, which after∣wards when, they would, they cannot leave; because, according to our true Proverbe, That will never out of the flesh which is bread in the bone. It would touch the quickest veines in the heart of a Christian Parent, to heare what a grievous complaint divers children made against their fathers & mothers inCyp. ser. de lap. Nos nihil fecimus, nec derelicto cibo & poculo Dei, ad profanas contagiones sponte prope∣ravimus, perdi∣dit nos aliena perfidia, paren∣tes sensimus parricidas, illi nobis Deum patrem, & ec∣clesiam matrē abnegarunt. S. Cyprian his dayes. Alas, what have we done that wee are thus pitiful∣ly tormented? The negligence, or treachery, or misguided zeale of our parents hath brought all this misery upon us; wee perish through others default; our fa∣thers and mothers have proved our murderers; they that gave us our naturall life bereaved us of a better, by depriving us of the wholesome nourishment of the Word, and giving us a scorpion in stead of fish; they plunged us in the mire of all sensuall pleasures, when they should have dipped us in the sacred Laver of regeneration; they kept us from God our Father, and the Church our Mother. But I will not longer insist upon this observation, because (as I conceive) the Spirit useth this speech not so much to set an edge upon our religious care & diligence, as give a backe to our patience; only I propose Monica the mo∣ther of S. Austin as a pattern to all parents:Aug. confes. l. 1. c. 11. Illa magis satage∣bat ut tu mihi pater esses quam ille, & conturbata e∣rat propter baptismi dila∣tionem, quoni∣am sempiter∣nam salutem meam chariùs parturiebat. Shee endured, saith hee, grea∣ter sorrow, and was longer in travell for my second birth than my first, and much more rejoiced at it; shee continued her fervent prayers day and night, with sighes of griefe and teares of love, for my conversion. Sometimes shee sought to winne mee by sweet allurements, sometimes by sharpe threats, sometimes by force of argument, sometimes by vehemency of passion; she dealt with many learned Bishops to conferre with me, to convince me of my errors, whereof one sent her away with this comfort;Confes. l. 2. c. 12. Fieri non potest ut filius tantarum lachrymarum pereat; It is not possible that a child should miscarry, for whom the mother hath taken so much thought, and shed so many teares. This care of planting religion in the hearts of children, as ground new broken up, and watering the roots of grace in them by frequent admo∣nitons and instructions, is assigned for the chiefe cause of those extraordina∣ry blessings which God bestowed upon Abraham: for so wee read,Gen. 18.17. Shall I hide from Abraham the things that I doe, seeing he shall be a mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall bee blessed in him? for I know him, that hee will command his sonnes, and his houshold after him, that they shall keepe the way of the Lord, to doe justice and judge∣ment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which hee hath spoken of him. Now because such is the wantonnesse and stubbornnesse of most chil∣dren, that they cannot be taught any thing without fear of the rod, the word  is in some sort appropriated to gentle corrections, such as are used by Masters and Fathers in the nurturing and teaching their scholars and chil∣dren. Wherein God taketh a cleane contrary course to the custome of most earthly parents: for they commonly beat those children whom they affect not, and lay stripes upon them often without cause or mercy; but they are
most indulgent unto, cocker up, and never leave embracing and kissing their darlings: God contrariwise scourgeth that childe most, whom he most delighteth in. Why? taketh hee any pleasure to see his dearest childrens eyes swolne with weeping, their cheekes blubbered with teares, their flesh torne with rods? Surely no: for they that are in such a plight, are rather ruefull spectacles of misery, than amiable objects of love: how then doth he that in love, which he loveth not to doe? Is not that elegant speech of Saint Austine a riddle, Castigat quos amat, non tamen amat Castigare; Hee chasteneth whom he loves, yet he loves not to chasten? None at all: for a Surgeon launceth the flesh of his dearest friend or brother in love, yet he taketh no pleasure in launcing, nor would doe it at all, but to prevent the festring of the sore. The best answer to the former objection will be, to assigne the reasons why God in justice and in love cannot oftentimes withhold his rod from his dearest children. To speake nothing of the reliques of originall sin in us after Baptisme, which like cindars are still apt to set on fire Gods wrath, and like an aguish matter left after a fit, still cause new paroxysmes of Gods judgements: ease it selfe and rest casteth us into a dead sleep of security, which we are never thoroughly awaked of, till God smite us on the side, as theActs 12.7. Angel did Peter. Prosperity, and a sequence of temporall blessings, like fatnesse in the soyle, breed in the mind a kind of ranknesse, which the sorrowes of afflictions eate out. Moreover, worldly pleasures distemper the taste of the soule, so that it cannot rellish wholsome food; which evill is cured by drinking deep in the cup of teares. Neither seemeth it to stand with the justice of God, that they who are to triumph in heaven, should performe no worthy service in his battels upon the earth. It is too great ambition for any Christian to desire two heavens; and to attaine greater happinesse than our Lord and King, who tooke his crosse in his way to his Kingdome, and was crowned with thornes before hee was crowned with glory.Lact. div. instit. Lactantius rightly observeth, Bonis brevibus mala aeterna, & ma∣lis brevibus bona aeterna succedunt: that we are put to our choice, either to passe from momentary pleasures to everlasting paines, or to passe from momentary paines to everlasting pleasures; either to forgoe transitory de∣lights for eternall joyes, or to buy the pleasures of sinne for a season at the deare rate of everlasting torments. Were there no necessity of justice, that they who are to receive a superexcellent weight of glory, should beare hea∣vie crosses in this life; nor congruity of reason, that they who are to be sa∣tisfied with celestiall dainties, should fast here, and taste of bitter sorrowes, that they might better rellish their future banquet: yet it were an indeco∣rum at least, that the Captaine should beare all the brunt, and endure all the hardnesse, and the common souldier endure nothing; that the head should be crowned with thornes, and the members softly arrayed; that the head should be spit upon, and the members have sweet oyntments poured on them. Wherefore Saint Paul teacheth us, that all whom God fore-knew, he predestinated to be made conformable to theRom. 8.29. image of his Sonne, who was so disfigured with buffets, stripes, blowes, and wounds, that the Pro∣phet saith, he had noEsa. 53.2. forme in him. What himselfe spake of the children of Zebedee, appertaines to us all, Ye shallMat. 20.22. drink of my cup, and be baptized with
the baptisme wherewith I am baptized withall. By baptisme he meaneth not to be dipped only in the waters of Marah, but to be plunged in them over head and eares, as the ancient manner of baptisme was. He who was nailed to the Crosse for us, will have us take up ourMat. 10.38. crosse and follow him. He that endured so much to shew his love to us, will have us in some sort to answer him in love: which as it is a passion, so it is tryed rather by passions than by actions; in which respect we must not only doe, but suffer for his sake, that our love may be compleat both in parts and degrees. To you it isPhil. 1.29. gi∣ven, saith Saint Paul, not only to beleeve in him, but to suffer for his sake. For he1 Pet. 2.21. suffered for us, giving us an example. Should he have suffered all for us, and as he tooke away all sinne, so all suffering from us, carrying away all crosses and tribulations with him; patience should not have had her worke among other divine vertues and graces, and thereby our crowne of glory should have wanted one most faire and rich jewell. Wherefore God, who is all goodnesse, desirous to make us partakers of all the goodnesse which our nature is capable of, by the misery of his distressed members giveth matter for our charity and compassion, by our continuall temptations mat∣ter for faith, by conflicts with heretickes and persecuters matter for con∣stancy, by the dangers of this life matter for wisedome, by our manifold infirmities and frailties matter for humility, by chastenings and afflictions matter for patience to worke upon. Whether for these, or any better reasons, best knowne to himselfe, it is that our heavenly Father holdeth a heavie hand sometimes over his dearest children, certaine it is, that few or none of them escape his stroake: he cha∣steneth as many as hee loveth; or, as wee reade Hebr. 12.6. hee scourgeth every sonne whom hee receiveth: therefore all that2 Tim. 3.12. will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer affliction. Afflictions are in our way to heaven: for wee must through manyActs 14.22. afflictions enter into the Kingdome of God. Before wee sing the song of Moses and the servants of God, we are to swimme through a sea of burning glasse: the sea is this present life, swelling with pride, wan with envie, boyling with wrath, deep with fraud and malice, foming with luxuriousnesse, ebbing and flowing with inconstancy; which is here said to be ofApoc. 15.2. I saw as it were a sea of glasse mingled with fire. glasse, to signifie the brittle nature thereof; and burning, to represent the furnace of adversity, wherein the godly are still tryed and purified in this world. And that we may not thinke, that God his rod is for those on∣ly who are habes in Christ Jesus, let us set before us David and Jeremy: the former a man after Gods owne heart; the latter a Prophet sanctified from his mothers wombe: the former laid his heart a soaking in the brine of afflicti∣ons: EveryPsal. 6.6. night (saith hee) wash I my bed, and water my couch with my teares: and,Psal. 102.9. I have eaten ashes for bread, and teares have been my drinke day and night. The other cryeth out in the bitternesse of his soule, I am the man that have seenLam 3.12, 15. affliction in the rod of his indignation. Hee hath bent his bow, and made mee a marke for his arrowes, and hath filled mee with bitter∣nesse, and made mee drunke with wormwood. Verily Job sipped not of the cup of trembling, but tooke such a deep draught, that it bereft him in a man∣ner of all sense, and put him so far besides himselfe, that he curseth the very day of his birth, and would have it razed out of the calendar:Job 3 4, 5, 6, 7. Let that day be darkned, let the shadow of death obscure it, let it not be joyned to the dayes of the
yeer, nor let it come within the count of the moneths: why dyed I not in my birth? why dyed I not when I came out of the wombe? Yee heare the loud cryes of Gods children, whereby yee perceive they feele oftentimes the smart of their Fathers rod, and are sore beat by him. Applicat. Deus unum habuit filium sine flagitio, nullum sine flagello.1. Is it so? doth God chasten every sonne whom he receiveth? nay in whom he delighteth, not sparing his only beloved sonne, with whom he was ever well pleased? why then should we looke to be priviledged and exemp∣ted from the orders of Christs schoole? How nice and tenderly have wee been brought up, that we cannot endure the sight of our heavenly Fathers rod? We sticke to sip of that cup which was Davids diet-drinke; and Jere∣my and Job tooke it all off: are we better than these holy men? nay are we too good to pledge our Saviour in the cup of his passion? Doe we breathe out some sighes in our crosses? hee sighed out his last breath in torments upon the crosse: Nos suspiramus in cruciatibus, ille expiravit in cruce. Doe our troubles and vexations draw some watery teares from our eyes? his drew from him teares of bloud, yea clotted bloud from all parts of his body. Doth the burthen of our sinnes presse our soules? the burthen of the sinnes of the whole world lay upon him. Are wee pricked with cares? hee was crowned with thorns. Are we cruciated? he was crucified. Tacitus reporteth, that though the amber ring among the Romans were before of no value, yet after the Emperour began to weare it, it became to be in great esteem: so (mee thinkes) sith our Lord and Saviour both bore his crosse, and was borne upon it, we should make better reckoning of crosses; and it should be coun∣ted an honour for every Christian to take up his crosse and follow him. 2. Againe, doth God chasten as many as he loveth; and consequently, loveth them not at all whom he never chasteneth? how far then are most of us besides the matter in our judgement, and opinion of these things? If we see a man flourish in prosperity, we commonly say such a man is belo∣ved of God; for he thriveth in the world, and all things prosper with him: but if on the sudden all the fruits of his labours are blasted with some sharp wind of adversity, if wee see him never without some griefe or other, some crosse or other, we alter our opinion, and suppose him to be some wretch, whom God plagueth for his sinnes. If the Viper be upon Pauls hand, hee is presently aAct. 28.4. murderer, whom vengeance would not suffer to live: whereas the verdict and sentence of the Holy Ghost, whereto our judgements should absolutely submit, is farre otherwise. Loe, these are the wicked, who have theirPsal. 17.14. portion in this life, the rod of God is not upon them: they grow in wealth, and their seed is established in their sight. They come in noPsal. 73.5, 6, 7. trouble like other folke, neither are they plagued like other men. Their eyes stand out with fatnesse, and they have more than heart can wish. Thou hast plantedJerem. 12.2. them, and they have taken root, and bring forth fruit. I speake not this to detract from the bounty of our gracious God, who hath the blessings of this life and the life to come in store for his children, and he bestoweth them upon them, when he seeth it good for them; but to lessen somewhat our great opinion of them, and put us in a better conceit of afflictions, which are surer arguments of Gods love than the other. Had the Apostle said, We must through many pleasures enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, it is to be thought Heaven would have been full by this time: but
he saith not so, but the direct contrary; We must through manyActs 14.22. afflictions enter into it. Wherefore, as passengers that have been told that their way lyeth over a steep hill, or downe a craggy rocke, or through a morish fen, or dirty vale, if they suddenly fall into some pleasant meddow enameled with beautifull flowers, or a goodly corne field, or a faire champian coun∣try, looke about them, and, bethinking themselves where they are, say, Surely we are out of the way, we see no hills, nor rockes, nor fens, nor deep clay: this is too good to be the right way. So in the course of our life, which is a pilgrimage upon earth, when we passe through fields of corne, or gar∣dens of flowers, and enjoy all worldly pleasures and contentments, let us cast with our selves: Surely this is not the way the Scripture directeth us unto, here are not the tribulations we are to passe through, we see no foot∣steps of Gods Saints here, but only the print of Dives feet; somewhere we have mist our way, let us search and find out where and when we tur∣ned out of it. This anxiety of mind, this carefull circumspection, this que∣stioning our selves, and suspecting our owne wayes, will bring us into the right way: for by thus afflicting our selves in prosperity, we shall make it the way to Heaven. As the Passeover was to be eaten with sowre herbes, so let us sawce all our worldly comforts with these sharp and sowre meditati∣ons, that we surfeit not of them. We find no grievous crime laid to Dives his charge, only this is father Abrahams memento to him: Sonne, remember thou receivedst thy pleasure in this life. ContinuallLact. divin. instit. l. 6. c. 21. Cavenda sunt oblectamenta ista tanquam laquei & pla∣gae, ne suavitu∣dinum mollitie capti, sub diti∣onem mortis cum ipso cor∣pore rediga∣mur cui man∣cipamur. prosperity and worldly pleasures are like lusci∣ous fruit, more sweet than wholsome: they distemper the spirituall taste, they breed noxious humours in the body, and dangerous maladies in the soule. And if they end not in sorrow, we are the more to sorrow for them, according to that sweet speech of SaintAug. confes. l. 10. c. 1. Cae∣tera vitae hujus tantò minus flenda, quantò magis fletur in iis, &c. Austine: The joyes and delights, or rather the toyes and vanities of this life, are by so much the lesse to be be∣wailed, by how much more we bewaile; and by so much the more to be bewai∣led, by how much the lesse we bewaile them, and for them. On the contrary, afflictions are usually tokens of Gods love, badges of his servants, argu∣ments of his care, remedies against most dangerous evills, and occasions of excellent vertues: and as the other have a sweet taste at the first, but are bitter afterwards; so these are bitter at the first, but sweet at the last. For in the end they bring the quiet fruit ofHeb. 12.11. righteousnesse to them thot are ex∣ercised thereby.John 16.20. Yee shall mourne, saith Christ to his Disciples, but the world shall rejoyce; but be of good comfort, your sorrow shall be turned into joy. What then? are we professedly to pray for afflictions? No, God requi∣reth no such thing; but only that we patiently endure them. May we not enjoy the blessings of this life? We may, but not over-joy in them. What Christ speaketh of riches, may be said of the rest: If honours, if promoti∣ons, if all sorts of worldly comforts abound to us, let us not set our hearts on them: let us neither accept the greatest preferments with his curse, nor repine at the greatest afflictions with his love. As Fabritius told Pyrrhus, who one day tempted him with gold, and the next day sought to terrefie him with an Elephant, which before he had never seen; Yesterday I was no whit moved with your gold, nor to day with your beast: So let neither abun¦dance
transport us, nor wants dismay us: neither prosperity exalt us, nor ad∣versity deject us; but both incite us to blesse God: In prosperity to praise his bounty, and in adversity his justice; and in both, his provident care over us. And the Lord of his infinite mercy informe us by his Word of the true estimate of the things of this life, that we neither over-value earthly blessings, nor under-value crosses and afflictions: that we be neither lifted up with the one, nor depressed with the other; but alwayes even ballanced with his love. And because the bitter cup of trembling cannot passe, but first or last we must all drinke it, let us beseech him to sweeten it unto us, and strengthen us with cordialls of comfort, that we faint not under his rod, but endure with patience what he inflicteth in love, and over∣come with courage what he suffered for love, that following his obedience, and bearing his crosse, we may enter his Kingdome, and weare his Crowne. Cui, &c.
THE LOT OF THE GODLY. THE XLVIII. SERMON. APOC. 3.19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Right Honourable, &c. I Have discovered unto you in the opening of this Text foure springs of the rivers of Paradise, for the comfort and refreshing of all that are heavie laden, and wearied in their travell to the celestiall Canaan, and often scor∣ched with the heat of heart-burning sorrowes and griefe: The first arising from the authour of afflictions. The second from the nature of afflictions. The third from the subject of afflictions. The fourth from the end of afflictions. 1. God sendeth afflictions, I. 2. Afflictions are chastenings, chasten. 3. Chastenings are the lot of all his children, as many. 4. All his children thus chastened are beloved, as I love. 1. God hath a hand in the scourging his children, I. Let us therefore 1. Submit under his mighty hand in patience. 2. Lay our hand on our mouth in silence. 3. Lift up our hands to him, and in prayer turne to him that smiteth us. 2. All our sufferings are chastenings of our heavenly Father for our a∣mendment. Let us therefore 1. Be instructed by them. 2. Take comfort in them. 3. Be thankfull for them.
3. Chastenings are the lot of all Gods children: therefore let 1. None repine at them, 2. All looke and prepare for them. 4. God striketh his children not in anger, but in love: therefore let us 1. Seeke to be of the number of his children, 2. Embrace his love, 3. In like manner chasten those whom we love. The water of the two former springs we have tasted heretofore; let us now draw out of the third, which is so great and spacious that all Gods children may bathe in it together. As many. God scourgeth every sonne whom he receiveth, not exemp∣ting his best beloved and only begotten Sonne. For theEsay 53.5. chastisement of our peace was laid upon him; he was chastened for our sinnes, but wee for our amendment. In every part of Gods floore there is some chaffe, afflicti∣on is the fanne to cleanse it: in all the gold of the Sanctuary there is some drosse, affliction is the fire that purgeth it: in all the branches of the true Vine there are some superfluous stems, affliction is the pruning knife to cut them off: in all the members of the mysticall body there are some peccant humours, affliction is the pill to purge them. We are all too greedy of the sweet milke of worldly pleasures, therefore God weaneth us from them by annointing the teat with wormwood. When the Angel in theApoc. 14.17. Apo∣calypse had recorded all the troubles, and calamities, and miseries that should fall in the last times, he closeth up all with this epiphonema, Here is the patience of the Saints: as if the Saints were to beare them all, who certainly beare the greater part. For besides common evills, in which most men (if not all) have their part, though usually Benjamins portion is the greatest, I meane, losse of goods, decease of friends, captivity, banish∣ment, imprisonment, sicknesse, and death; there are many heavie crosses laid upon the Saints of God, which the children of the world never see, and much lesse feele the weight of them. Many have written learnedly of the divers sorts and formes of materiall crosses, wherewith the bodies of Gods children have been tortured by persecuting Tyrants; but none yet hath, or (as I am perswaded) can describe the spirituall crosses, where∣with many of them have been, and are daily martyred in minde. I will set five before you, and let every one adde his owne particular crosse unto them: they are 1. Derision. 2. Indignation. 3. Compassion. 4. Spirituall desertions. 5. Godly sorrow. 1. Derision: for as Ismael derided Isaac, and as Michol scoffed at David, so they that areGal. 4.29. borne of the flesh, mocke at them that are borne of the spirit; and this scorne and derision so grievously afflicted many of Gods children, that it is called in ScriptureHeb. 11.36. persecution, and a great triall. Others had triall of cruell mockings; and as he that was borne of the flesh persecuted him that was borne of the spirit, so it is now. 2. Indignation at the prosperity of the wicked, which was a great eye∣sore,
as wee heard before, toJob 21.7, 8, 9.10.11, 12, 13. Job,Psal. 73.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12. David, andJer. 12.2. Jeremy. 3 Compassion for the miseries of Gods chosen, 2 Cor. 11.28, 29. 4 The state of spirituall desertion, when God seemeth for a time to with∣draw the comforts of the Spirit from them, Psal. 22.1, 2. 5 Godly sorrow, when they are cast downe to the ground with the weight of their sinne, and have a quicke sense and feeling of the displeasure of their heavenly Father. The three former scourges draw many teares from their eyes; but the two latter life-blood from their hearts: and if God stay∣ed not his hand, and in the depth of their sorrowes refreshed them with comforts, they could not but be swallowed up in the gulfe of despaire. For the more a man feareth God, and is sensible of his love, the more tender hee is to beare his wrath; and the tenderer hee is, the arrowes of God pierce deeper, and sticke faster in the soule, which none can plucke out but hee that shot them. Ovid. de trist. l 1.—Qui vulnera fecit Solus Achilleo tollere more potest. The reprobate, as Calvin rightly observeth, though God lay often upon them many heavie stroakes, yet because they weigh not the cause, nor are pricked in heart for their sinnes, by their carelesnesse gather hardnesse; and because they murmure and kicke against God, and make an uproare against his proceedings, their rage transporteth them into madnesse, and their mad∣nesse breeds in them an insensible stupidity: but the faithfull being admoni∣shed by God his correction, presently descend into the consideration of their owne sinnes, and being stricken with griefe and horrour, flye to him by humble prayer for pardon; and unlesse God in mercy should asswage these sorrowes, wherewith their soules are heavie unto death, they would buckle under so great a burden, and languish in despaire. The manner of thePlin. nat. hist. l. 28. Psylli si arbitrantur supposititium esse aliquem in stirpe, admo∣vent ei ut pun∣gant colubra; si non sit de gen∣te, mori cum pupugerint; si de gente sit, vi∣vere. Psilli (which are a kinde of people of that temper and constitution that no venome will hurt them) is, that if they suspect any childe to be none of their owne, they set an adder upon it to sting it; and if it cry and the flesh swell, they cast it away for spurious: but if it never quatch nor be the worse after it, they account it their owne, and make very much of it. In like man∣ner Almighty God tyres his children by enduring crosses and afflictions: he suffereth the old Serpent to sting them, and bring troubles and sorrowes upon them; and if they patiently endure them and make good use of them, hee offereth himselfe unto them as to children, and will make them heires of his kingdome: but if they roare, and cry, and storme, and fret, and can no wayes abide the paine, hee accounteth them forHeb. 12.8. bastards and no chil∣dren. God commanded the Altar, and Table, and Candlestickes, and ves∣sels, and instruments in the Sanctuary to bee made of pure and beaten gold: and accordingly all they that hope or desire to bee made vessels of honour and golden instruments of Gods glory, must make account to bee tryed in Gods furnace, and beat with his hammer. Wee may not looke to finde God in the pleasant gardens of Egypt, whom Moses found in the thorny bush. The Spouse in the Canticles met not with him whom her soule loved in the day of prosperity, but in the night of adversity. None ought to bee extraordinarily affected in ordinary accidents, nor im∣propriate
to himselfe the common afflictions of all Gods children. The Po∣et said truely, Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris. Therefore Socrates professed that hee was the more willing to drinke off his fatall potion prepared by the State, because after his death hee should meet with Palamedes, whose lot it was to bee unjustly condemned, as hee was. If there bee any vertue in this drugge, any comfort in the society of suffe∣rers, if griefe bee diminished by dividing it among many, wee have as many partners in our afflictions as God hath children in the world: wee beare not alone Christs whole crosse, as Simon Cyreneus once did; all the Saints of God beare a part with us. May wee not in this respect take great comfort in affliction, that by them we are made free of Christs school, and partakers of the nurture & discipline of all Gods children, and in it every day more and more conformed to the image of our Saviour? which the more it was defa∣ced, the more fair and beautifull it maketh us; the more pitifull it was to be∣hold, the more powerfull to move compassion, and purchase to us freedome from all misery and woe. The stretching of his joints added to our stature, and the blacknesse and wannesse of his stripes proved the beauty of our soules: the wider his wounds were torne, the more anguish ran out of our sores; the more blood hee shed out of his heart, the more hee powred in∣to our veines, and the abundance of his teares was the overflowing of our waters of comfort. Therefore the Spouse of Christ contemplating the i∣mage of her husband, by so much the more amiable, by how much the more disfigured for her sake, blusheth not to proclaime her selfe blacke;Cant. 1.5. Bernard. in Cant. Non e∣rubescit nigre∣dinem quam scit prcaeessisse in sponso, nihil gloriosius pu∣tat, quam Chri∣sti portare op∣probrium. I am blacke, O ye daughters of Jerusalem. Because it was the colour of her hus∣band, shee taketh a glory in bearing his shame; a holy pride in resembling the colours of his stripes: Nigredo est, sed sponsi similitudo est; seeme it a deformity, yet it is a conformity to her husband Christ Jesus. Yea, but CardinallBell. l. 4. de not. eccles. c. 18. Bellarmine laboureth to wrest out of our hands the strong weapons wee finde in my text against impatiency, and repining at af∣flictions: for hee maketh temporall felicity an inseparable note of true be∣leevers, and consequently temporall infelicity, and outward calamities the markes of heretickes and reprobates, living and dying without the Church, as being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel. If this were so, all the balme of Gilead would not cure the wounds and sores of Christs afflicted members: if to losses, disgraces, banishment, imprisonment, and all outward evils which they often endure, you adde the note of a reprobate, and a fearefull expectation of everlasting paines to succeed these which put their patience daily to the test; how can they but condemne their eyes to everla∣sting teares, who have no hope of a better life hereafter, and are here made a spectacle to the world, and Angels, and men, who are killed all the day long, and therefore dye daily? But bee of good comfort all yee who sigh and groane under the burden of your afflictions, or weight of your crosses: he who excludeth you out of the true Church by reason of your manifold afflictions in this life, exclu∣deth with you the holy Prophets and men of God, before Christs com∣ming, and since;Heb. 11.36, 37, 38. Who were tryed with mockings, and scourgings; yea more∣over
with bonds and imprisonment, were stoned, were hewen asunder, were slain with the sword, wandered up and downe in sheepes skins, and goats skinnes, destitute, afflicted, and tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. Hee ex∣cludeth the glorious company of the Apostles, and noble army of Martyrs, and Christ himselfe from the true Church. All the Jesuiticall sleights which this cunning Sophister useth, cannot avoid the evident absurdity lighting upon his erroneous assertion, unlesse hee can impeach the sacred records; where wee finde the Church butchered in Abel, floating in the Arke, go∣ing on pilgrimage in the dayes of the Patriarchs, taken captive in Egypt, af∣ter wandering in the wildernesse, flying to save her life, and hiding her selfe in the time of idolatrous Kings: and after Christs comming into the flesh cruelly persecuted, first by Heathen, after by Arrian and hereticall Empe∣rours, and last of all by Antichrist and his adherents. Yee see by this Epi∣tomy of her story the reason of her complaints,Cant. 1.6. Regard mee not be∣cause I am blacke, for the sunne hath looked upon mee, the sonnes of my mother were angry against mee.Cant. 5.7. The watchmen that went about the City found me, they smote mee, and wounded mee, and tooke away my vaile from me. Stay me with flaggons, and comfort me with apples, for I am sick for love. Hereby also you may give a fit motto to those emblemes in holy Scripture, A lilly a∣mong thornes, A dove whose note is mourning, A vine spoyled by little foxes, and partly rooted out by the wild bore of the forrest, A woman great with childe, and a fiery dragon pursuing her. According to which patternes Saint Jerome frameth his,Rubus ar∣dens est figura ecclesiae, quae flammis perse∣cutionum non consumitur, sed viret magis. Hier. in verb. Exod. 3.2. A bush burning, yet not consuming; and as fitly Saint Grego∣ry draweth her with Christs crosse in her hand, with her challenge there un∣to, Ecclesia haeres crucis, The Church is an inheretrix of the crosse. And it ap∣peareth by all records hitherto that she hath possessed it; and if wee examine the matter well, wee shall finde that Christ had nothing else to leave her at his death. For goods and lands upon earth hee never had;Mat. 8.20. The foxes, saith hee, have holes, and the birds nests, but the sonne of man hath not where to lay his head. His soule hee bequeathed to his father, his body was begged by Joseph of Arimathea, his garments the souldiers tooke for their fee, and cast lots upon his vestments: onely the crosse, together with the nailes, and gall and vinegar bestowed upon him at his death, hee left her as a Heriot. For these, withall the appurtenances, scourges, cryes, sighes, groanes, stripes, and wounds, hee bequeathed to her by his life time, in those words,Joh. 16.33. Mat. 10.17, 18. & 24.9, 10, 11. Joh. 16.10. In the world yee shall have troubles, they shall persecute you in their Synagogues, and scourge you, and yee shall bee hated of all men for my names sake; insomuch that they that kill you, shall thinke they doe God good service. Yee shall weepe and mourne, but the world shall rejoice. Upon which wordsLib. de spe∣ctac. c. 28. Vi∣cibus res dis∣posita est, luge∣amus ergò dum ethnici gaudēt, ut cum lugere coeperint gau∣deamus, ne pa∣ritèr nunc gau∣dentes, cum quoque paritèr lugeamus: delicatus es, Christiane, si & in seculo voluptatem concupiscis; imò niiis stultus si hoc existimas voluptatem. Tertullian in∣ferreth, God hath disposed of joyes and sorrowes by turnes; let us mourne when worldlings rejoice, that when they mourne wee may rejoice. Thou art too dain∣ty and choice, O Christian, if besides the joyes of heaven laid up for thee, thou lookest for a liberall portion of delights and pleasures in this world; nay thou art too foolish if thou countest there is any true pleasure in such things wherein they place their happinesse. I need not presse many texts of Scripture which yeeld this sharp juice: as,Psal. 34.19. Many are the troubles of the righteous:2 Tim. 3.12. All that
will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution:1 Pet. 4.17. Judgment begins at the house of God; this verse alone which I now handle is sufficient to cleare Christs afflicted members from all note of heresie, and imputation of re∣probates. For if afflictions are chastisements of Gods children, and tokens of his love (I rebuke and chasten as many as I love) then are they not ne∣cessarily judgements for sinne, messengers of wrath, much lesse proper markes of heretickes and reprobates. The kingdome of heaven is not neces∣sarily annexed to earthly crownes, nor is eternall glory any way an appen∣dant to worldly pompe. To conclude, affluence of temporall blessings is no note of the true, because store of afflictions is no note of the false Church. Which truth is so apparent, that many Papists of note have ex∣presly delivered it in their annotations upon holy Scripture; asStap. in verb Joh. In mun∣do pressuras habebitis. Stapleton, the Rhemists, andMald. in Mat. 5. Facit solem orire supr bo∣nos & malos: unde perspicu∣um est homi∣num aut natio∣num prosperos successus, nul∣lum signum aut testimonium esse verioris aut purioris re∣ligionis. Maldonate: God causeth his Sunne to rise upon the just and upon the unjust; whence (saith the Jesuite) it is evident that the prosperity of men or nations is no certaine signe or argument of the truth or purity of reli∣gion which they professe. Howbeit as Praxiteles drew Venus after the pi∣cture of Cratina his Mistresse, and all the Painters of Thebes after the simi∣litude of Phryne a beautifull strumpet: so Bellarmine being to paint and limme Christs Spouse, took his notes from his own Mistresse, the Romane Phryne, the whore of Babylon, and mother of fornications. Looke upon the picture of that strumpet drawne to the life by Saint John (Apoc. 17.) and let your eyes bee Judges. I saw (saith hee) a woman sit upon a scarlet colou∣red beast (vers. 3.) full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten hornes (vers. 4.) And the woman was arrayed in purple, and scarlet colour, and decked with gold, and pretious stones, and pearles, (what is this but Bel∣larmine his note of temporall felicity?) having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations; of which it seemeth the Cardinall dranke deepe, when he tooke the pencill in his hand to pourtray the true Church, else hee could not be so out in his draught, nor so utterly forget not only what others, but himselfe also had formerly set downe in this point. For in his solution of an objection of Martin Luther, who stood in the opposite extreme, affirming afflictions to bee an inseparable note of the Church, hee confesseth freely that the Church in the beginning and in the end was in great straights: and for this purpose, to shew that persecutions though they eclipse the glory of the Church, yet can never utterly extinguish it, hee alledges such re∣markable passages out of the ancient Fathers as these:Justin. Mart. in apolog. Persecution is but the pruning of Christs vine: and,Tertul. in A∣pologet. the blood of Martyrs is as seed: and,Leo Ser. 1. de Pet. & Paul. the graines that fall one by one and dye in the earth, rise up againe in great num∣bers. If the Church runne into superfluous stemmes without the pruning knife of afflictions: if the blood of martyrs turneth into seed to generate new Martyrs: if the Church in her nonage had many sore conflicts, and shall have greater in her old age; certainly abundance, ease, pleasure, and glory, which make up temporall felicity, are no notes of her: forL. 1. de notis eccles. c. 2. Notae debem esse inseparabiles, the notes of any thing cannot bee severed from it, as him∣selfe affirmeth. By this I hope yee all perceive a great difference betweene the true lineaments of Christ his Spouse, and Bellarmine his counterfeit draught; betweene the Queene of Solomon all glorious within, and the whore of Babylon all pompous without; betweene the manicles
and fetters of the one, and the bracelets and chaines of the other; between the cup of affliction in her hand, and the cup of abominations in the hand of this; and yee are perswaded that of all outward markes, next to her speech, the language of Canaan, and her diet the blessed Sacrament, the surest are some scars and cuts, together with the print of stripes upon her otherwayes most faire and unspotted body. Yet because the law condemneth no man before hee hath beene heard, though perhaps hee hath nothing, or as good as nothing to say for himselfe, I will propose unto you his allegations, which are principally the examples of Abraham, Moses, David, Ezekiah, and Josias; and by these hee will bee tried, whether temporall happinesse bee not a note of true professours. To which instances I answer in generall, that if these men had beene cho∣sen out of God, upon whom hee will shew the riches of his goodnesse in the blessings of this life, yet their speciall priviledges were not to come into the account of common favours, nor their particular examples to make ge∣nerall rules. The inward estate and life of the Church more dependeth up∣on the outward happinesse of Princes, than the fortunes of private men; neither can wee judge of a Play by one Scene, nor of the happinesse of a mans life by one act, or more, but the whole current thereof. But what if these Worthies of the world, whom he singleth out for paragons of hap∣pinesse, had no temporall felicity at all? or none in comparison with their troubles and adversitie? or at least in comparison with the prosperity of the heathen Emperors, and persecuting Tyrants, whose dominions were far larger, estate securer, victories incomparably greater? Vouchsafe you a looke to his particulars. First, hee bringeth in Abraham as an example of the temporall felicity of true professors, whom the Scripture rather proposeth as a patterne of pa∣tience, and a spectacle of manifold adversity: a pilgrim wandring from his owne countrey, afflicted with famine in Egypt, forced to forgoe his wife, and deny her to save his life, without any issue by her till his old age, and when God gave him a sonne commanded to slay him with his owne hands. Yet may it bee pleaded for Bellarmine that Abraham got a notable victo∣ry, and wan the field of Kedarlaomer and other Kings, and rescued his bro∣ther Lot. Admit this, but withall let it bee noted that in the selfe same story Lot was taken prisoner by Kedarlaomer, and consequently that victory in warre is no certaine argument of the truth of religion. Howsoever, will they conclude it to be summer by the flight of one swallow? or account it a faire day wherein the sun once sheweth himselfe? I need not speake of Moses, in whom hee secondly instanceth, the Scrip∣ture is plaine,Heb. 11.25. That he chose rather to suffer affliction with the children of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. Who can be ignorant, except peradventure some Lay Papist prohibited to read the sacred Scriptures, how Moses was exposed by his parents, put in an Ark of bulrushes into the river, saved from drowning by Pharaohs daughter? how he fled to save his life, & kept close forty yeers in the land of Madian? And after he had led the chil∣dren of Israel through infinite difficulties & dangers, notwithout many mur∣murings and conspiracies against his person, when hee came to the very borders of Canaan was forbid to enter in, and commanded by God himselfe
to dye upon Mount Nebo. What shall I speake of David and the rest? did not forraine warres, and home-bred seditions, the conspiracy of his owne sonne Absolom against him, together with infinite other troubles, griefes and cares, constraine him oftentimes to mingle his drinke with his teares, and the songs of Sion with his sighes? Was he a mirrour of temporall hap∣pinesse, who complaineth in the bitternesse of his soule; I am weary of my groaning, every night wash I my bed and water my couch with my teares: my beauty is gone for very trouble, and worne away because of all my enemies. I am a worme and no man, the very scorne of men, and out-cast of the people. One depth of sorrow calleth upon another, all thy waves & stormes have gone over mee? As for Hezekiah, it cannot be denied that God richly rewarded his zeale, and crowned the calendar of his life with many festivals; yet Saint Bernards observation was verified in him, that no man ever had such a pro∣sperous course, but that he received a rub before his death: Fieri non potest ut in hoc seculo quisquam non gustet angustias. For in his time Sennacharib besieged Jerusalem, and put the good King in feare of his crowne and life: and after his miraculous delivery from that danger, he fell into a worse. For he was smitten with a dangerous disease, thought to bee the plague: Esay 38.1.the Text saith, he was sicke unto death; and in the bitternesse of his paine, and feare of present death, he cryeth out, Ver. 17.Behold, for felicity I had bitter griefe and misery. But most of all is the Cardinall out in his last instance of Josi∣ah, of whom after the commendation of his zeale in reformation of Religi∣on, and taking away all abominations out of Israel and Judah, we reade lit∣tle, but that fighting with Pharaoh Neco he was slaine at Megiddo, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him, and the Prophet Jeremy, and all singing men and singing women bewailed his death in their lamentations to this day. Yee see how unhappy this great Advocate of Rome is in his instances of temporall happinesse; yet had they been all happy whom he nameth, and drunke their fill of the rivers of pleasure, and never tasted the waters of Marah, what are they to that greatApoc. 7.9. multitude which no man can number, of all nations, and kinreds, and people, that stood before the Throne and the Lambe, arrayed with long white robes, having palmes in their hands? concerning whom when one of the Elders asked, what are these, and whence came they? and Saint John answered, Lord, thou knowest: the Elder reply∣eth, saying: These are they that came out of great tribulation, and have wa∣shed their robes, and made them white in the bloud of the Lambe: therefore are they in the presence of the Throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple, and he that fitteth on the Throne will dwell among them. I will conclude this point with that grave determination of S.Lib. 1. de ci∣vit. Dei, c. 8. Placuit divinae providentiae praeparare in∣posterum bona justis, quibus non frueren∣tur injusti; & mal mpiis, quibus non cruciabuntur justi: ista verò temporalia bona & mala utrisque voluit esse communia, ut nec bona cius appetantur, quae mali quoque habere cernuntur; nec mala turpiùs evitentur, quibus & boni ple∣runque aficiuntur. Austine: It pleased divine providence to prepare hereafter good things for the righte∣ous, wherein the wicked shall not partake with them; and evills for the wicked, wherewith the righteous shall never bee troubled: but as for these temporall good things and evill, hee would have them in some sort common to both; that neither the blessings of this life should be too greedily desired, in which wicked
men have a share, neither crosses and afflictions too fearfully avoided, which we see fall often to the lot of the righteous. In summe, neither prosperity, nor adversity, nor affluence of earthly blessings, nor afflictions, are infallible demonstrations of Gods love, nor certaine and inseparable notes of Christs Church. Afflictions may be (though usually they are not in them that feare God) judgements of wrath; and temporall blessings may be (though usu∣ally in most men they are not) tokens of Gods love. Therefore let us not set our heart and affections upon worldly goods, because they are often the portions of the wicked; neither yet let us set our hearts wholly against them, because they may fall to the lot of the righteous, and do, when they may further and not hinder their eternall salvation. Let us not desire the greatest preferments of this world with Gods hatred, nor refuse the grea∣test crosses with his love. Let us not repine at the temporall felicity of the wicked, which endeth in eternall misery; nor be dismayed at the temporall infelicity of the godly, because it endeth in everlasting felicity. Let prospe∣rity commend our charity and temperance, and adversity our courage and patience. Let us doe for Christ in the one, and suffer for him in the other, and in both estates admire his provident ju∣stice, and for both sanctified unto us, praise his gracious goodnesse. Cui, &c.
THE OYLE OF THYME. THE XLIX. SERMON. REV. 3.19. As many as I love I rebuke and chasten. Right Honourable, &c. PLutarch in his Treatise of thePlut. de a∣nim. tranquil. , &c. tranquility of the mind, writeth, that though Thyme be a most dry and bitter herbe, yet that not only the Apothecaries draw an wholsome oyle out of it; but also that the Bees extract from thence sweet hony. This dry and bitter herb is af∣fliction to the taste of most men; yet out of it we have drawne both a wholsome oyle to cure a wounded consci∣ence, and hony also to delight the spirituall taste. Oyle out of the nature of afflictions, which are chastenings, and hony out of the cause, Gods love: As many as I love I rebuke and chasten. In this Text the parts answer the num∣ber of the words, the arguments the parts, the comforts the arguments, as I have declared heretofore; yet they all (with much adoe) draw our assent to this conclusion, That we are not to rise up at, nor to faint under Gods cor∣recting hand. For the doctrine of enduring affliction is durus sermo, quis potest ferre? a hard speech, who can endure it? Albeit we know that God hath the chiefe stroake therein, and all his dearest children have part with us, yet we grudge at them: though we are taught even by God himselfe, that they are effects of his love, and causes of our good, yet we are dismayed at them. So bladder-like is the soule of man, that being filled with earthly vanities, though but wind, it groweth great, and swelleth in pride; but if it be pricked with the least pin or smallest needle of piercing griefe, it present∣ly shriveleth to nothing. Afflictions are pillulae lucis (pills made on pur∣pose to cleare the eye-sight) prescribed by a most tender and skilfull Phy∣sician,
gilt over with the names of chastenings and fatherly corrections, and sugered with the love of God, yet they will not downe: nay it is well if it be not so ill with many of us, that we returne him bitter words for his bit∣ter pills, and storme against him, who hereby bringeth to us the quiet fruit of righteousnesse, insani adversus antidotum, quo fani esse possimus, growing mad against the remedy of our madnesse. For are we not come to that passe, Ut nec morbos nec remedia ferre possimus, that we can neither endure our pain, nor abide the cure?Rom. 5.3. Tribulation (saith the Apostle) bringeth patience: It should doe so indeed, and through the power of grace it doth so in perfect Christians; but the contrary is verified in the greater part of men. Tribu∣lation bringeth impatience, not of it selfe, but according to the disposition of the patient; as wholsome potions given to generate good bloud, in a fowle stomach turne to choler. In this case the Physicians prescribe purges. Pur∣ges are to bee given according to the nature of the humour to be purged; and therefore the cure of the malady begins at the knowledge of the cause, which in this will be found to be the reliques of originall corruption, nourished by the ill dyet of the soule, immoderately glutting her selfe with sensuall delights, and much increased by false opinions. To begin with the sinke of originall sinne, sending up noisome fumes and vapours, which distemper the inward man. Of other things, as peace of con∣science, and joy in the Holy Ghost, we easlier speake than conceive them, and easlier conceive them what they may be in others, than sensibly appre∣hend them in our selves; but wee feele rather than understand, and under∣stand better than wee can expresse this hereditary disease and habituall de∣pravation of our whole nature. It is that corrupt humour, or malignant qua∣lity drawne from the loynes of our first parents, which tainteth our bloud, surpriseth our vitall faculties, stoppeth or much hindereth the motions of Gods Spirit, and the operations of this grace in us; so that wee neither can doe, nor suffer the will of God without regret and reluctancy. It is the pri∣ma materia of all diseases, the tinder of naturall lusts, easily set on fire with hell: it disposeth us to all evill, and breedeth in us an aversnesse from all good: it is not subject to theRom. 7.23. Law of God, neither can it be; it rebelleth against the law of our mind, and enthralleth us to sin and Sathan, and even af∣ter we are freed from the dominion of sinne, so fettereth our feet, that we cannot with any expedition run the wayes of Gods commandements. Though the prosperous gales of Gods Spirit drive us toward the haven where we would be; yet the main tide of our corruption runneth so strong the contra∣ry way, that we much float, and saile but flowly. Saint Peter, no doubt, after our Saviour acquainted him with the kind of death whereby he was to glo∣rifie God, did his best to incline his will that way; yet he could not keep it to that bent, but that it slacked and bowed another way, as Christs words imply: Ducent te quo nolis, They shallJohn 21.18 lead thee whither thou wouldest not. He saith not they shall draw thee, but they shall lead thee. Peter therefore was in some sort willing to goe with them that led him to the crosse, yet hee somewhat shrinked at it: though the spirit was strong in him, yet the flesh was weake. Who ever did or suffered more for the Gospel than Saint Paul? yet he professeth that in regard of the law of sinne in his members, theRom. 7.19. good which he would doe he did not, and the evill which he would not doe, that
he did. And being thus crossed in all his godly desires and endeavours, hee cryeth out, ORom. 7.24. wretched man that I am, who shall deliver mee from this body of death? Yee see now the root of bitternesse set so deep in our hearts, that it can∣not be pluck't up till wee are transplanted: there is no hope in this life to purge out this matter of continuall diseases, it is so mingled with our radi∣call moisture, the balsamum of our lives; only wee may abate it by sub∣tracting nourishment from it, and allay the force of it by strengthening na∣ture against it by prayers, godly instructions, and continuall exercises of religious duties. A neerer cause of our so great distemper in afflictions wee owe to the delights of our prosperity, which, as the pleasures of Capua did Hannibals souldiers, so weaken our mindes, and make us so choice and tender, that we cannot beare the weight of our owne armour, much lesse the stroakes of an enraged enemy. TheHieron. ad Heliod. Cor∣pus assuetum tunicis loricae onus non fert, caput opertum linteo galeam recusat, mol∣lem otio ma∣num durus ex∣asperat capu∣lus. body used to soft raiment, cannot beare the weight of an helmet, the head wrapped in silke night-caps, cannot endure an iron head-piece, the hard hilt hurteth the soft hand. It was wisely observed by theSenec. sent. Res adversae non frangunt, quos prosperae non corrupe∣runt. Heathen Sage, that none are broken with adversity, but such as were weakened before, and made crazie by ease and prosperity. Sound trees are not blowne downe with the wind, but the rootes rather fastened thereby; but corrupt trees eaten with wormes, engendered of superfluous moisture, are therefore throwne downe by the least blast, because they had no strength to resist. Why do losses of goods so vexe us, but because we trusted in uncertaine ri∣ches? Why is disgrace a Courtiers hell, but because he deemed the favour of the Prince, & places of honourable employment his heaven? We are there∣fore astonished at our fall, because sometimes with David in the height of our worldly felicity we said, Wee shall never beePsal. 30.6. moved. If when we had the world at will, we had used the things of this life as if wee used them not: now in the change of our estate, our not using them would be all one as if we used them. The best meanes to asswage the paines of affliction when it shall befall us, will be in the time of our wealth to abate the pleasures of prosperity: if we sawce all our earthly joyes with godly sorrow, all our worldly sorrow shall be mixed with much spirituall joy and comfort. Let us not over-greedily seeke, nor highly esteem, nor immoderately take, nor intemperately joy in the delights and comforts which wealth and prospe∣rity afford, and the rod of Gods afflicting hand shall fall but lightly upon us. Let us not so fill our hearts with temporary pleasures, but that wee leave some place for these and the like sad and sober thoughts: What are riches, honours, pleasures, and all the contentments of this life, that be∣cause I enjoy them for the present, I should take so much upon mee? The Divell offereth them, the wicked have them, Gods dearest children of∣ten want them: therefore they are not eagerly to be sought. They are not good but in their use, nor things but for a moment, nor ours but upon trust: therefore not greatly to be esteemed. They, without store of grace in our selves, and good counsels from others, strengthen the flesh, weaken the spirit, nourish carnall lusts, choake all good motions, cloy our bodily, and wholly stupifie our ghostly senses, cast us into a dead sleep of security, but awake Gods judgements against us: therefore
they are sparingly to be tasted, not greedily to be devoured. These and the like meditations are not only good preservatives in pro∣sperity, but also lenitives in adversity: as they helpe us to digest andPind. od. 1. . con∣coct felicity, so they strengthen us to beare misery. All that wee now pos∣sesse, and the world so much doteth upon, what are they in their nature and condition but things indifferent? therefore wee ought to bee indifferently affected to them, and the contrary: they are transitory, what strange thing then is it, if they passe from us? they are farre inferiour to the immortall spirit that quickneth our bodies, therefore cannot the want of them deprive it of happinesse: they are not our inheritance for ever, nor our donatives or legacies for life, but talents for a while committed to us, to employ them to our Masters best advantage: therefore the restoring them back is no mulct, but a surrender; no losse, but a discharge. The more of this sort wee are trusted with, the more liable we are to an account: how then are wee hurt or endammaged by the diminution of that which lessens our accounts? Fi∣nally, they are often effects of Gods wrath, and their effects usually are sen∣suality, security, and stupidity, against which afflictions are a speciall re∣medy. To extract then the quintessence of the herbes and flowers of Para∣dise, and make of them a cordiall to comfort us in worldly losses. Nothing is absolutely good but God, all other things respectively only; temporall blessings, as they proceed from his love, and may be imployed to his glo∣ry, in this respect only to be desired and loved. If then wee affect God in them, and enjoy them in God, and it be made apparent unto us, that affli∣ctions and losses are sometimes more certaine tokens of Gods love, and that they minister unto us more matter and greater occasion of testifying our love to him, and meanes of setting forth his glory, we should be rather glad than sorrowfull when God seeth it best for us, to exchange the former for the latter. Yea but the forlorne Christian (out of all heart, because in his conceit out of Gods favour) will reply, Shew mee that the countenance of God is not changed towards mee, nor his affections estranged from mee, and it suf∣ficeth: surely kissings and embracings, not blowes and stroakes, are love complements; how may I be perswaded that God layeth his heavie crosse upon mee in love? Nay, how canst thou not be perswaded, sith hee him∣selfe hath said it, I chasten as many as I love? which words that thou maist take more hold of, he hath often repeated them in holy Scripture. Desirest thou greater assurance than his words, which is all that heaven and earth have to shew for their continuance? yet if thou desire more, rather helpes of thine infirmity, than confirmations of this truth, observe who are oftenest & longest under Gods afflicting hand, who are fullest of his markes: if they are deepest in sorrow, who are highest in his favour: if they mourne in Si∣on, who sing Halelujah in the heavenly Jerusalem: if they goe in blacke and sables here, who are arrayed in long white robes there: if they lay their heart a soake in teares, who are men after Gods owne heart: if Benjamins porti∣on be greatest in afflictions, assuredly manifold tribulations and Gods fa∣vour may stand together. In the truth of which assertion all those Texts of Scripture may establish us, which set before us the sweet fruits that are ga∣thered from the crosse: as,
1. Knowledge: It is good for mee that I have beenPsa. 119.71. afflicted, that I may learne thy statutes. 2. Zeale: I willHosea 5.15. goe and returne to my place, till they acknowledge their offences, and seeke my face: in their affliction they will seeke mee diligently. 3. Repentance: I truly amPsal. 38.17, 18. set in the plague, and my heavinesse is ever in my sight: I will confesse my wickednesse, and be sorry for my sinnes. When the people were stung with fiery serpents, they came to Moses and said, We haveNum. 21.7. sinned: for wee have spoken against the Lord, and against thee. And a∣gaine, In their2 Chro. 15.4. trouble they turned to the Lord God of Israel, and sought him, and he was found of them. When the Prodigall was pinched with famine, he came to himselfe and said, How many hiredLuke 15.16, 17, 18. servants in my fathers house have meat enough, and I perish with hunger? I will arise therefore and goe to my father, &c. 4. Patience: Tribulation workethRom. 5.3, 4. patience, and patience experience, and experience hope. 5. Joy in the Holy Ghost: Receiving the Word with much affliction, with1 Thes. 1.6. joy in the Holy Ghost. 6. Triall of our faith, which like1 Pet. 1.7. gold is purged by the fire of afflictions. Though heJob 13.15. slay mee, yet will I trust in him. OurPsal. 44.18, 19, 20. heart is not turned backe, nor our steps gone out of the way, no not when thou hast smitten us into the place of Dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death. 7. Righteousnesse: No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, butHeb. 12.11. grievous: neverthelesse, yet afterwards it yeeldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousnesse to them that are exercised thereby. 8. Holinesse: ItHeb. 2.10. became him, for whom were all things, in bringing many sonnes unto glory, to consecrate the Captaine of our salvation through affli∣ctions. TheHeb. 12.10. fathers of our flesh for a few dayes chastened us after their owne pleasure: but hee for our profit, that wee may bee partakers of his ho∣linesse. 9. Estranging our affections from the world and earthly desires: E∣liah requested that he might dye, It is1 Kin. 19.4. enough, Lord, take away my life, I am no better than my fathers. We that are in this tabernacle doe2 Cor. 5.4. groane, being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mor∣tality might be swallowed up of life. 11. Humility: The2 Cor. 12.7. messenger of Sathan was sent to buffet mee; and that I should not be exalted above measure, there was given mee a thorne in my flesh. 11. Renovation and ghostly strength: Therefore I2 Cor. 12.10. take pleasure in infir∣mities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses: for when I am weake, then am I strong, and though our outward man decay, yet our inward man is renewed day by day. 12. Freedome from everlasting torments: When1 Cor. 11.32. wee are judged, wee are chastened of the Lord, that wee should not bee condemned with the world. 13. Encrease of celestiall glory: For our2 Cor. 4.17. light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glory. The Heathen that never tasted the least part of these fruits, yet feeling by experience, that the mind cloyed with continuall felicity grew a burden
to it selfe, was deprived hereby of matter and occasion of excellent vertues; and not so onely, but infatuated and wholly corrupt thereby, maintained this memorable Paradoxe,Demet. apud Sen. Nihil eo infelicius cui nihil intelix contigit. That none was so unhappy as bee who knew no mishap nor adversity at any time. Nay they went farther in that their conceit, and thereby came nearer to my text, affirming that store of wealth, large possessions, high places, and great honours, were not alwaies signes and tokens of the love of God. God, saith the wise Poet (and the best Philosopher taketh it out of him)Aristot Rhet. l. 2  sendeth many men great prosperity, not out of love and good will, but to the end that they may bee capable of grea∣ter misery, and that the calamities which they are after to endure may bee moreuven sit. Numerosa parabat excel∣sae turris tabu∣lata, unde alti∣or esset casus, & impulsae prae∣ceps immane rumae. eminent and signall: —Tolluntur in altum Ut lapsu graviore ruant. Misery is alwayes querulous, and even weake objections often ruine them who are already cast downe with griefe: such as are these; Doth not God threaten to powre out his plagues upon the wicked? Doe wee not read in SaintRom. 2.9. Paul, Tribulation and anguish upon every soule that sinneth, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile? Are not losses, infamy, captivity, banish∣ment, tortures and torments, judgements of wrath? how then can they bee arguments of love? I answer, that originally all the evils of this life came in with sinne, and were punishments of it; and they retaine their nature still in the wicked: but in the godly, by the mercy of God, and me∣rits of Christ, they are changed from judgements of wrath, into chastise∣ments of love; from stings of sinne, to remedies against sinne; from execu∣tions of vengeance, to exercises of excellent vertues: and the inflicting of them so little prejudiceth Gods love to his chosen, that hee no way more sheweth it to them than by thus awaking them out of their sleepe, and by this meanes pulling them out of hell fire. And therefore the Prophets threaten it after all other judgements, as the greatest of all, that for their obstinacy and impenitency God would punish them no more:Isa. 1.5. Why should yee bee stricken any more, saith the Lord? which is as if a Physician should say concerning his desperate Patient, I will minister no more physicke to him, give him what hee hath a minde unto, because there is no hope of life in him. As it is a loving part in a Tutour to correct his Scholar pri∣vately for a misdemeanour, to save him from the heavier stroak of the Ma∣gistrate, or the Jaile: so it is a singular favour of God to chasten his chil∣dren here, that they may not bee condemned with the world hereafter. I end the solution of this doubt with the peremptory resolution of Saint Ber∣nard:In Cant. Si Deus non est recum per gratiam, ade∣tit pre vindi∣ctam: sed vae tibi si ita recum adest, imo vae ibi si ita tecum non dist. If God be not with thee, O Christian, by grace, he will be with thee by vengeance or judgement here; and woe bee to thee if hee bee so with thee, nay woe bee unto thee if hee bee not so with thee, or not so even with thee: for if thou art preserved from temporall chastisements, thou art reserved to eternall pu∣nishments. The last doubt that riseth in the minde of the broken hearted Christian, to bee assoyled at this time, is drawne from the words of the wise man;Eccl. 9.2. All things fall alike unto all men, the same net taketh cleane and uncleane fowles, and enwrappeth them in a like danger. In famine what difference
betweene the Elect and Reprobate? both pine away: In pestilence what distinction of the righteous and the sinner? both are alike strucke by the Angel: In captivity what priviledge hath hee that feareth God more than hee that feareth him not? both beare the same yoake: In hostile invasion how can wee discerne who is the childe of God, and who is not; when all are slaughtered like sheep, and their blood like water spilt upon the ground? Here not to referre all to Gods secret judgement, who onely knoweth who are his intruth and sincerity;  nor to rely wholly upon his extraordinary providence, whereby hee miraculously saveth his servants, and preserveth them in common calamities, even above hope, as hee did Noah from the deluge of water which drowned the old world; as hee did Lot from the de∣luge of fire, which overwhelmed and burnt Sodome and Gomorrah; as hee did the children of Israel in Goshen from the plagues of Egypt; as hee did Moses from the massacre of the infants by Pharaoh; as hee did Elias from the sword of Jezebel drunke with the blood of the Prophets; as hee did all those Christians among the Romans, that fled to the Sepulchres of the Martyres, when the city was sacked by theAug. l. 1. de civ. Dei. c. 1. Gothes; as hee did those pious children, who carried their fathers and mothers upon their backes through the midst of the fire in the Townes neare Aetna, whereofC 6. . A∣ristotle religiously discourseth in his Booke De mundo: When, saith hee, from the hill Aetna there ranne downe a torrent of fire that consumed all the houses thereabout, in the midst of those fearefull flames Gods speciall care of the godly shined most brightly: for the river of fire parted it selfe on this side and that side, and made a kinde of lane for those who ventured to rescue their aged parents, and plucke them out of the jawes of death. To make an evident distinction betweene the godly and the wicked wee see here the fire divided it selfe, as the waters before had done in theExod. 14.22. pas∣sage of the children of Israel through the red Sea. Howbeit these ex∣emptions and speciall protections in common calamities, are neither ne∣cessary nor ordinary.  I answer therefore farther, that two things are to be considered in the good or evill casualties (as they are called) of this life: the nature and substance of them, which is in it selfe indifferent; and the accidentary quality, which maketh them good or bad. Now so it is ordered by divine providence, that the wicked possesse oft times the substance of these things; I meane, houses, lands, treasure, and wealth: but they have not them with that quality which maketh them good; I meane, the right use of them, and contentation of minde in them. On the contrary, the godly often lacke the substance of these things, yet not that for which they are to bee desired, and which maketh them good, contentment of minde, with supply of all things needfull: in which regard the indigencie of the godly is to bee preferred before the plenty and abundance of the wicked; according to that of the Psalmist,Psal. 37.16. A small thing that the righteous hath is better than great riches of the ungodly. And doubtlesse that large promise of our Saviour,Mar. 10.29. There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or lands for my sake and the Gospels, but he shall receive an hundred fold in this time, is to bee under∣stood (according to the former distinction) thus; Hee shall receive an
hundred fold, either in the kinde, or in the value; either in the sub∣stance of the things themselves, or in the inward contentation, and the heavenly wealth I now spake of. In like manner death, and all cala∣mities, which are as it were sundry kindes of death, or steppes unto it, have a sting and venomous quality, which putteth the soule to most unsufferable paine, and rankles, as it were, about the heart: I meane Gods curse, the sense of his wrath, the worme of conscience, discon∣tent, impatience, despaire, and the like:1 Cor. 15.55. O death (saith Saint Paul) where is thy sting? In like manner wee may insult upon all other e∣vils; O poverty, O banishment, O imprisonment, O losses, O cros¦ses, O persecutions, Where is your sting? it is plucked out of the af¦flictions of the godly, but a worse left in the prosperity of the wic∣ked: In which regard the seeming misery of the godly is happy, but the seeming prosperity of the wicked is miserable. Albeit God sometim s giveth them both a drinke of deadly Wine, yet hee tempereth the sharpe Ingredients of judgement, with corrective Spices of mercy, and sweet¦neth it with comforts in the Cup of the godly.2 Cor. 1.5. As their sufferings for Christ abound, so their consolations also abound by Christ. And this evidently appeareth by the different working of the Cup of trembling in both: the wicked presently after their draught rave, and grow franticke, but the godly are then in their best temper; the wickedApoc. 16.10. gnaw their tongues for sorrow, but the godly employ them in prayer and praises; the wicked bite Gods iron rod, and thereby breake their owne teeth, but the godly kisse it; the wicked are most impatient in affli∣ctions, the godly learne patience even by afflictions. In a word, the one in extremity of paine are swallowed up with desparation, the other are ravi∣shed withJam. 1.2. exceeding joy, they areRom. 8.37. more than conquerors in all these things through him that loveth them; and therefore they more than rejoice.Rom. 5 3, 4, 5 For they glory in tribulation, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and pati∣ence experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in their hearts by the holy Ghost, which is given unto them. Upon this answer, after much agitation, Saint Austine settled his judgement, when hee saw much Christian bloud mingled with the heathen in divers parts of Italy, spilt by the Gothes:L. 1. c. 8. de Civ D i. Ma∣n dissimilitu∣do psiotum in similitudine pssionum, & licet sub tor∣mento non est idem virtus & vitium. Nam sicut sub uno ign aurum ru∣tilt, pla tu∣mat; & sub ea∣dem tribulà stipulae com∣minuuntur, frumenta pur∣ganur; nec i∣do oleum cum amnicâ con∣sunditur, quia eodem  pondere xpri∣mitur, &c. Tantum inter∣st non quli, sed qulis quo∣que patiatur. Notwithstanding the likenesse of the sufferings of both, there remaines yet a great dissimilitude in the suffe∣rers: and even in the same torments vertue and vice may bee distinguished; in the same fire the gold shineth, the chaffe smoaketh; under the same flale the corne is purged, the stubble bruised; under the same presse the oyle is powred in∣to vessels, the foame spilt. By all which we see that perpetuall felicity with security is a most fearfull judgement of God; and that seasonable afflictions with comforts to sweeten them, grace to beare them, strength to overcome them, wisdome to make use of them, are speciall favours of Gods chosen. Now the Lord of his infinite mercy, who scourgeth every sonne whom he receiveth, receive us whom he scourgeth; he who chasteneth whom he lo∣veth, love us whom he chasteneth; he who correcteth us for our profit, teach us to profit by his corrections, sanctifie all crosses and afflictions unto us, uphold us in them, carry us through them, purge us by them, and crowne us after them. Cui, &c.
THE SWEET SPRING OF THE WATERS OF MARAH. THE L. SERMON. Apoc. 3.19. As many as I love I rebuke and chasten. Right Honourable, &c. SAintCyp. de bon. patient. De pa∣tientiâ loquu∣turus, fratres dilectissimi, & utilitates ejus & commoda praedicaturus, unde potiùs incipiam quam quod nunc quoque ad au∣dientiam ve∣stram video pa∣tientiam esse necessariam, ut nec hoc ipsum quod auditis & discitis sine pa∣tientiâ sacere possitis? Ciprian having proposed to his auditory bonum patientiae, the good of bearing, for his theame reckoneth (if I may so speak) upon the stocke, and maketh his ad∣vantage of the very duty and service they were at that time to performe to God, in affording to the Minister of his word their religious attention and Christian patience. Being to treat of patience, saith hee, dearly beloved, and to recount the sundry commodities that by it accrew to the sancti∣fied soule, whence shall I rather take my beginning than from the necessity of, this vertue to the holy exercise wee are now at; which cannot bee performed as it ought, without the concurrence of your patience with the divine assistance, and my labour? I cannot speake profitably to you in commendation of patience, except you heare me with patience. Mutato nomine de me Fabula narratur. This godly fathers case hath bin, & yet is mine, who am to entreat your pa∣tience to treat yet once more of patience in your hearing: & if the handling often the same argument, and pressing the like motives to patience hath see∣med wearisom & tedious unto you, I may hence gather with that father an argument for patience, without which ye cannot endure the least affliction,
no not of the eare. But if the repeating and inculcating the like doctrine and arguments were not burdensome unto you, I may safely presume upon your patience, to seale up my text, and perfect my meditations upon so ne∣cessary & profitable a subject.Sen. ep. Nun∣quam satis di∣citur, quod nunquam satis discitur. We cannot hear too much of that which we can never learne enough. Sorrowes and disturbances are very many, and worke strongly upon our fraile nature; but spirituall medicines of the soules ma∣ladies and comforts worke but weakely: therefore it is wisedome to take as many of them as we can. If they who are subject to swouning, and gene∣rally all that are carefull of their bodily health, will have cordiall waters in readinesse at hand, that they may not be to seeke in time of need; how much more ought all Christians, who are still either in feare, or in danger of conflicts with troubles and vexations, be provided of store of spirituall comforts; the rather because they serve as well to moderate their prospe∣rity, as to mitigate their afflictions? For the same meditations which some way sweeten the brine of affliction, that it be not too salt and quicke, sauce the pleasures of prosperity, that they be not too sweet and luscious. What stronger levers to raise up a drouping soule, than these in my Text, that afflictions proceed from God in love, and fall upon all his dearest children for their good? Againe, what stronger clubs to beate downe pride and in∣solencie in all such as abound in earthly comforts, and know no end of their wealth, and keepe under the minde, that it be not too much lifted up with temporall blessings, than these inferences from this Scripture, that God chasteneth with afflictions, and pampers not up with pleasures, all such as he beareth a speciall affection unto? Therefore may they thus well reason with themselves; For all our honour and wealth we are in no better, nay per∣haps we are in far worse estate than the poorest and miserablest creature up∣on earth, that hath run thorough or is in the midst of all calamities. God cha∣steneth him in love for his amendment, but he hath no care of us, he lets us run riot in sin: that poore wretch hath now his paiment, ours is to come, we know not how soone: he hath his paine here with Lazarus, but we take out our pleasures with Dives: therefore may it be just with God to change his paine into pleasures, but our pleasures into everlasting paines. Better weep in Christs schoole, than sport at the Divels games: better to want all things and to have Gods love, than to have all things else and want it. If it had not beene better, Moses would never have chosen to suffer afflictions with the servants of God,Heb. 11.15. rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sinne for a season. These uses alone, if there were no more to be made of this soveraigne par∣cell of Scripture, sufficiently recompence our labour, in decocting the spirits, and drawing this oyle of comfort out of it: but the more we trie and apply it, the more vertue we shall finde in it, and use to be made of it. I have al∣ready counted many particulars in my former discourses upon these words, and the supply of the rest (together with the summe of the whole) shall be my taske for the remainder of the time. I will begin with the occasion, which was a deepe wound of griefe which the Angel of Laodicea might seeme to have received from that keene and cutting reproofe, Because thou art neither hot nor cold, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Now that he might not take on too farre by reason of so grievous and heavie a message, the Spirit verifieth his name Paracletus, and healeth and suppleth the wound
with these comfortable words, As many as I love I rebuke and chasten. Gather not too much upon my former sharp reproofes and threats a∣gainst thine owne soule, there is yet place for thy zealous repentance: de∣spaire not of my favour, nor wrong my love in thy over-weening con∣ceit; I would not have so rebuked thee, if I had not loved thee. Are those that are in Gods place to rebuke sinne, and chasten offenders, so carefull not to drive them to desperate courses? will they daigne as God here doth, to yeeld a reason of their proceedings, and mitigate their sharpe censures with favourable expositions, & take away all scruples out of mens minds, which their speeches and actions might otherwise leave in them? Yee see the occasion, and by it the scope of the Spirit, and connexion of the words, which carry this sense: I rebuke with conviction, and chasten with instruction all those whom I love, not onely at large, as I doe all mankind; but in a speciall manner, as I doe those whom I intend to make heires and co-heires with my only begotten Son. Here wee have a speciall action of Gods carefull providence over his children. Now the actions of God may be considered in a double respect, either as they come from the Soveraigne of all power above us, or as he is the patterne of all goodnesse to us: as they are actions of soveraignty, they require of us obedience, and an awfull and a trembling regard of them; as they are examples of goodnesse, we are to seeke to imitate them, and ex∣presse them in our lives. According to the former consideration, these acti∣ons of God, and words of my Text, rebuke and chasten, strengthen those that are under the rod; but according to the latter, they direct those that are to use it: the former when they are chastened, the latter when they cha∣sten, are to take notice of the severall circumstances set down in the Text. More particularly and plainly thus, 1. We learne out of the words Gods care of his, whom he reclaimes by threats and chastenings from their evill courses. 2. The condition of the Church militant, which is seldome without re∣bukes and chastenings. 3. The imperfection of inherent righteousnesse, and difficulty, or rather impossibility of performing the Law now after our fall: all Gods deare children are rebuked and chastened by him; and therefore are not without blame or fault: These are the speciall observations. Their use must be to informe our judgement in the true estimate of the things of this life, to stirre up our love to God, who taketh such care of and paines with us (as it were) to call us home unto him by threatning of judgements, and correcting us with a fatherly and compassionate affection. Let us yet resume the words, and consider the proceedings of the Almigh∣ty, and wee shall see in God his actions, the Magistrate his direction and charge, and in the Magistrate his charge of distributing these tokens of Gods love, the duty of all inferiours, to receive them with the same affe∣ction wherewith they are given. The Minister is to reprove, the Judge to convince, the Father to nurture, the Magistrate to punish, the Master to discipline those that are under them without partiality, with moderation and in love: those that are under their authority they may not revile, but rebuke; not torment, but chasten; not some in a spleen, but all in love,
by the example of the Spirit in my Text: God rebuketh whom he liketh, and chasteneth whom he rebuketh, and loveth whom he chasteneth. Amor ille fra∣ternus, saith SaintAug. confes. lib. 10. c. 4. Re∣spirent in bo∣nis, suspirent in malis. Austine, we may say paternus sive approbet me, sive im∣probet me diligit; O that fatherly mind, which whether it approve mee, or re∣prove mee, still loveth mee, is worth all. Amor (saith the old man in the Poet) est optimum salsamentum; Love is the best sawce of all: it giveth a rellish to those things that are otherwise most distastefull and loathsome. It is most true of Gods love: for it maketh rebukes gratefull, and even chastenings com∣fortable; I rebuke and chasten as many as I love. Happy are we, if we are of these many; forJob 5.17. blessed is he whom God correcteth. Howsoever all chastening seemeth grievous unto us for the present, yet it after bringeth theHeb. 12.11. quiet fruit of righteousnesse to those that are exercised thereby. Wherefore it is worth the observation, that David prayeth not simply, O Lord, rebuke mee not, neither chasten mee; for that had been as much as to say, O Lord, love mee not: for God rebuketh and chasteneth every one whom he loveth; but he ad∣deth,Psal. 6.1. Rebuke mee not in thine anger, neither chasten mee in thine heavie dis∣pleasure: or, as Junius rendereth it out of the Hebrew, in aestu irae tuae, in the heat of thy wrath. I rebuke. Was it enough to allay and coole the boyling rage of the young man in the comedy, Pater est, & si non pater esses; were thou not my fa∣ther? shall not this word I in my Text, and this consideration, that Gods hand is in all our afflictions, be more forcible to quell the surges of our pas∣sions within the shore of Christian patience, that they break not forth, and fome out our own shame? It was the speech of Laban & Bethuel, though de∣void of the knowledge of the true God,Gen. 24.50. This thing is proceeded of the Lord, we cannot therefore say neither good nor evill. We who are better instructed must alter the words, and say, This thing is proceeded of the Lord, this crosse is sent us from him; therefore we cannot but say good of it: we must thanke him for it. In this losse, sicknesse, disgrace, banishment, imprisonment, or whatsoever affliction is befallen us, the will of our heavenly Father is done upon us; and is it not our daily prayer, Fiat voluntas tua, Thy will be done? Looke we to the author and finisher of our salvation, hee bowed his will to take upon it his Fathers yoake: shall we with a stiffe necke refuse it? Father (saith he) let this cup passe, let it passe, if it be possible let it passe. Ye heare he prayeth thrice against the drinking of it with all possible vehemency and earnestnesse; yet presently he yeeldeth to forgoe his will, and undergoe his passion: Sed fiat voluntas tua, non mea; But thy will be done, not mine: or, Neverthelesse, not as IMat. 26.39. will, but as thou wilt. Not as I will, these words im∣ply an unwillingnesse; Neverthelesse, be it done as thou wilt, sheweth a re∣solute will: here is a consent of will without a will of consent, a will against a will, or a will and not a will: Non mea, sed tua. As man he expressed a na∣turall feare of death and desire of life, yet with a submission to the will of his Father: it was not his will to take that cup for it selfe, and antecedent∣ly, and as he saw wrath in it; yet as hee saw the salvation of man in it, and greater glory, it was his will to drink it off consequently, because such was his Fathers good pleasure, to which his will was alwayes subordinate. SaintCyp. de bono patient. Domi∣nus secit vo∣luntatem Pa∣tris sui, nos non faciemus & patiemur vo∣luntatem Do∣mini? Cyprian speaketh home in this point to all that repine at what God sendeth them, be it never so bitter to their carnall taste: Our Lord did, and
suffered the will of his Father, shall not we doe and suffer the will of our Lord? he conformed his will to his Fathers, shall not we ours to his? If these in∣ducements from the love of God and example of our Saviour, which pre∣vaile most with the best dispositions, worke not kindly with us, let vulgar and common discretion teach us to make a vertue of necessity. Suffer we must what God layes upon us: for who canRom. 9.19. resist his will? If we suffer with our will, wee gaine by our sufferings a heavenly vertue for a worldly losse or crosse; we make a grace of a judgement: if we suffer against our will, we suffer neverthelesse, and lose all benefit of our sufferings. We adde drunken∣nesse to thirst, and impatience to impenitence, passive disobedience to active, and what doth obstinacy and rebellion against the will of God availe us? Doe the waves get by their furious beatings against the rockes, whereby they are broken? the bones in our body by resisting the lightening, where∣by they are bruised and consumed (the soft and yeelding flesh being no way hurt?) The strong and tallest trees by their stiffe standing, and setting themselves as it were against the wind, give the wind more power over them to blow them downe to the ground, and teare them up by the root, whereas the reeds and bents, by yeelding to every blast, overcome the wind, and in the greatest and most blustering storme keep their place and standing. Alas, the more we struggle, and strive, and tugge to plucke our necke out of Gods yoake, the more paine we put our selves to; the oftner and stronger we kicke at the prickes of Gods judgements, the deeper they enter into our heeles:Vae opposi∣tis voluntati∣bus: quid tam poenale, quàm semper velle quod nunquam erit? & sem∣per nolle quod nunquam non erit? inaeter∣num non obti∣nere quod vult, & quod non vult inae∣ternum susti∣nere? Woe be to these crosse wills (saith St. Bernard) they shall never attaine what they would, and they shall ever sustaine and endure what they would not. As grace in the godly is a means to procure the increase of grace: as the cymball of Africa sweetly tinckleth, Ipsa meretur augeri, ut aucta mereatur; so punishment in the wicked, through their impatience, be∣commeth a meanes to improve both their sinnes and punishments: for after they have suffered for not doing the will of God, they are againe to suffer, and that most deservedly, for their not suffering patiently their most deser∣ved punishments. If any be so wedded to their wills, that they will not be severed from it, no not to joyne it and themselves to God, let them in the last place consider, that the only meanes to have their will perpetually, is to resigne it to God; not only because Voluntas inordinata est, quae non est sub∣ordinata; The will which is not subordinate to God, is inordinate, and therefore not to be termed will, but lust; but especially, because such is the condi∣tion proposed to us by God, either to suffer temporall chastisements for our sinnes with our wills, or eternall punishments against our wills. If we will have our will in all things here, we shall want it for ever hereafter; but if we will be content to want our wills here in some things for a time, we shall have our will in all things, and fill also of heavenly contentments for evermore hereafter. And chasten. If all afflictions of the godly are chastenings, and all cha∣stenings are for instruction, then to make the right use of them, we are not only in general, but also in particular to search our selvs, what those sins are in our soules, which God seeketh to kill in us by smart afflictions. If our affli∣ction be worldly losses, let us consider with our selvs, whether our sin were not covetousnesse: if disgrace and shame, whether our sinne were not am∣bition:
if scarcity and famine, whether the sinne were not luxury: if bodi∣ly paines, torments, or aches, whether wee offended not before in sinfull pleasures: if a dangerous fall, whether the fault were not confidence in our owne strength: if trouble of mind, and a fit of despaire, whether before we provoked not God by security and presumption. This to have bin the practice of Gods Saints, as in other examples, so we may cleerly see in the brethren of Joseph, who impute the hard measure that was mett to them in Egypt, to the like hard measure they had mett to their brother Joseph, saying one to another:Gen. 42.21. We verily sinned against our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soule, when he besought us, and we would not heare: therefore is this anguish come upon us. We find it also in Saint Paul, who conceived that the2 Cor. 12.7. messenger of Sathan was sent to buffet him, that he might not be lif∣ted up above measure with his so many graces and speciall revelations: And when certain virgins ravished by barbarous souldiers, in regard they found in themselves no spot of impurity before they suffered this violence, called in question the justice of God, for permitting those unclean persons to have their will of them, who had all their life preserved their honour and reputa∣tion untainted, and their bodies unspotted, SaintLib. 1. de ci∣vit. Dei, c. 28. Austine wisely adviseth them to search their hearts, whether those insolent indignities offered them by the worst of men, might not be a punishment of some other sinne, ra∣ther than unchastity; and in particular, whether their sinne were not their pride of this vertue, and too highly prizing their virginity: for pride even of virginity is as fowle a sinne before God as impurity. As many. Experience teacheth us, that what wee see in water seemeth greater than it is. It is most true, if we speake of the waters of Marah, they make any thing that befalleth us appeare greater than it is: See if there be anyLam. 1.12. sorrow like unto my sorrow, saith captive Judah. I am theLam. 3.1. man, saith Jeremy, that hath seen affliction (as if none but hee had seen the like:) in like manner David, and after himJonah 2.3, 4. Jonas: All thy waves and stormes have gone over mee. What more direct Text of Scripture to checke and reprove this fansie than this, As many as I love I rebuke and chasten? All Gods dearest children first or last are visited as well as we, and those perhaps more grie∣vously by whom it is least seen: our affliction is in body, theirs may be in their mind: our losses may bee of transitory goods and worldly wealth, theirs may be of spirituall graces, or the like; so that howsoever wee am∣plifie our miseries, yet all things considered, we shall have small reason to exchange them with any other. As I love. To many other reasons before touched, two may be added why afflictions may proceed from Gods love. The first, because they make the mind soft and tenderly affected, and thereby apter to receive a deep impression from love. Excellent to this purpose is that meditation of St.Gregor. in Cant. 2.5. Corda nostra malè sna sunt, cùm nul∣lo Dei amore sautiantur, cùm peregri∣nationis erumnam non sentiunt, cùm nullo erga proximum affectu languescunt; sed vulnerantur ut sanentur, quia amoris spiculis mentes Deus insensibiles percutit, moxque sensibiles per ardorem charitatis reddit. Gregory upon those words of the Spouse in the Canticles, as he rendereth them, vulnerata charitate ego, I am sicke of love: Our hearts are indisposed when they are not wounded with the love of God, when they feele not the trouble and misery of our pilgrimage, when they pine not away through ardent desires and longing to be with God; but they are
wounded that they may be healed: God striketh our minds and affections with the darts of love, that they may have more sense and feeling of celestiall ob∣jects. The second is, because affliction estrangeth our affections from the world, and entirely fixeth them upon God, which before were divided be∣tween him and the world. Now it is most proper to love to appropriate the object beloved to it selfe; whom we entirely affect, we desire to have entire to our selves, and none other to have part with us. To draw towards an end; those many whom Christ here chasteneth di∣stributivè, or one by one, are collectivè the militant Church, whose mem∣bers we are: her rebukes are our shame, her chastenings our discipline, her affliction our condition, either by passion of griefe or compassion of love. Behold then what is her usage in her pilgrimage upon earth; her greetings are rebukes, her visits chastenings, her love-tokens crosses, her bracelets manicles, her chaines fetters, her crisping-pins thornes and nailes, her drink teares, her markes blacke and blew wounds, her true emblemeMat. 2.18. Rachel mourning for her children, and refusing all comfort because they are not. A wife of pleasures had been no fit match for him, who is described by the Prophet to be a man of sorrowes, with a head crowned with thornes, eyes bigge with teares, cheekes swolne with buffets, his heart pricked with a speare, his hands and feet pierced with nailes, his joynts set on the racke of the Crosse, his whole body bruised with stripes, and torne with whips and scourges. Ecce homo; Behold the man, and judge whether is likelier to bee his consort, the Whore of Babylon, or the mother of our faith: the one sitteth upon many waters, the other is ready to be overwhelmed with a floud cast out of the mouth of the Dragon at her: the one is arrayed with purple and scarlet, the other in mourning weeds, stained with her owne bloud: the one adorned with chaines of gold, the other clogged with fetters of iron: the one for many ages treading on the neckes of Kings and Princes, the other trod∣den downe by them at the foot of Christs Crosse. But be of good cheare, thou afflicted and disconsolate Spouse, let not the pompe and beauty of thy corrivall be an eye-sore unto thee: according to theRev. 18.7. measure of her pleasures shall her torments be. It cannot now be long, forbeare a while, and shee shall be stripped of all her gay attire, but thou clothed in a vesture of gold wrought about with divers colours: when she shall be carried with sorrow and heavi∣nesse to the dungeon of everlasting darknesse, thou shalt with joy and glad∣nesse be brought into the Kings chamber: thy cheekes now blubbered with teares, shall be decked with rubies, and thy necke with chaines; hee will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver. Here I might make an end: for what out of the words of the Spirit in my Text hath bin spoken to cheare up the Spouse of Christ, bewailing her de∣plorate estate, belongeth to every faithfull soule that hath her part in her mothers griefes. Howbeit, more distinctly to propose the instructions and comforts laid out in this Scripture to your most serious consideration, and apply them to those in particular whom they most concerne, may it please you to sort with mee all the members of the militant Church into 1. Those that are comforted, but in feare of affliction. 2. Those that are afflicted, but in hope of comfort.
All that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer affliction; and therefore all necessarily fall under the members of this division: for the former the Spirit in my Text pointeth to this exhortation. Ye whom God hath enriched with store, graced with preferments and honour, prospered with all happinesse amidst your pleasures, jollity, and mirth, remember the affliction of Joseph, and despise not the condition of Lazarus, but partake with them in their sorrowes by compassion, and take part from them by your charitable reliefe: their turne of sorrow is come, and neere past, yours is to come; they are now rebuked and chaste∣ned, yee may be, nay yee shall be, if yee are of those in my Text, on whom God casteth a speciall eye of favour: if yee are not of those, then is your condition worse than that of the poorest Lazar. Beware of flat∣tering tongues as of Serpents stings, or rather more of those than these: for those venome but the flesh, and make it swell, these corrupt the soule, putrifie it with lust, and make it swell with pride. If honours, riches, and pleasures were certaine arguments of Gods love and favour, the dearest of his children could not be so often without them as they are. Value not your selves by these outward vanities, but by inward vertues, take heed how ye drinke deep of the sugered wine of pleasures, set not your hearts upon the blessings of this life; for then they will cease to be bles∣sings unto you, nay they are already become curses, because they with∣draw you from God, which is a kind of death of the soule. How then may we know, that they are undoubtedly blessings of God unto us, that we may rejoyce and take comfort in them? By this: If we over-joy not in them, if they diminish not, but contrariwise increase our love of God: if they serve as instruments and encouragements of vertue, not nourishments of vices: if our expence on the poore be some way answerable to our re∣ceits from God: if we love them only for his sake that gave them, and for his sake are willing to part with them.Lib. de mi∣rab. cuscuit. Aristotle writeth of a parcell of ground in Sicilie, that sendeth such a strong smell of fragrant flowers to all the fields and leazes there-about, that no Hound can hunt there, the sent is so confounded with the sweet smell of those flowers: Consider (I beseech you) this seriously with your selves, whether the sweet pleasures of the world have not produced a like effect in your soules; whether they have not taken away all sent and sense too of heavenly joyes; whether they hin∣der you not in your spirituall chase: if not, ye may take the greater joy and comfort in them, because it is an argument of rare happinesse not to be o∣vercome of earthly delights, not to be corrupted with temporall happi∣nesse. But if ye find that these transitory delights and sensuall pleasures have distempered your taste, in such sort that ye cannot rellish heavenly com∣forts: if they have made your hearts fat, as the Prophet speaketh, so that the spirits of your devotion are dull and grosse, and ye are altogether insen∣sible of Gods judgements, then re-call your minds from those pleasant ob∣jects, and represent to your conceits the loathsome deformity of your sins, the fearfull ends of those that are rich, and not in God, the vanity of earthly comforts, and the heavie judgements which ye have deserved by being not made better but worse by Gods benefits. These very thoughts will be as rebukes and inward chastenings, which if they worke in you godly sorrow
and unfained humiliation, God will spare further to afflict you who are al∣ready wounded at the heart, or humble you whom he finds already hum∣bled. Now for those that are under Gods hand, afflicting them outwardly with any scourge, the Spirit layeth forth this exhortation: It is God that rebuketh you; justifie therefore not your selves, acknowledge your sins, that hePsal. 51.4. may be justified in his sayings, and cleare when he is judged: it is he that chasteneth you, resist not, but submit and amend: hee rebuketh and chasteneth you in love, repine not at it, but be thankfull. What folly is it to resist Gods will? I. What profit to be nurtured? chasten. What honour to be admitted into Christs Schoole, and ranked with Gods dearest chil∣dren? as many. What comfort to be assured of Gods love? as I love. The wheat is purged by the flaile, the gold tryed by the fire, the vine pruned by the knife, the diamonds valued by the stroake of the hammer, the palm groweth up higher by pressing it downe, the pomander becomes more fragrant by chasing. If your afflictions be many and very grievous, know that God maketh not choice of a weake champion, be assured that he will lay no more upon you than he will enable you to beare. Souldiers glory in their wounds which they receive in warre for their King and Country: have not we much more cause to glory in them which we endure for the love of God? What joy will it be at that day, when the Son of man commeth with the clouds, and layeth open his scarres before all the world, to have in our bodies store of his sufferings, and to be able to shew like stripes and wounds to his? Possesse your soules therefore in patience for a while, and on the sudden all prisons shall be opened, all chaines loosened, all stripes healed, all wrongs revenged, all your sufferings acknowledged, all your miseries en∣ded, and your endlesse happinesse consummated. I end in the phrase of the Psalmist: Though in the great heat of affliction and persecution yee look as if yee had lien among the pots, yet ye shall be as aPsal 68.13. As a dove co∣vered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. dove, whose feathers are silver, and wings of pure gold, wherewith your soules shall flye into heaven, and there abide and nest with Cherubins and Seraphins for ever. Deo P, Filio, & Spiritui sancto sit laus, &c.
THE PATTERN OF OBEDIENCE. THE LI. SERMON. PHIL. 2.8. Hee humbled himselfe, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Crosse. Right Honourable, &c. OPposita juxta se posita magis elucescunt, contraries are il∣lustrated by their contraries; the darke shadow ma∣keth the picture shew more lightsome, the blacke vaile the face more beautifull, a gloomy cloud the beames of the sunne breaking out of it more bright and con∣spicuous, sicknesse health more gratefull, paine plea∣sure more delightfull, affliction and misery prosperity and happinesse more desirable: in like manner the obscurity and infamy of Christs passion setteth off the glory of his resurrection. Neither doth it illustrate it only, but demonstrateth it also à priori; for his humiliation was the meritorious cause of his exaltation, his obedience of his rule, his crosse of his crowne: so saith the Apostle in the next verse, therefore hath God highly exalted him. As wee cannot certainly know how high the surface of the sea is above the earth, but by sounding the depth with a plummet, or diving to the bottome thereof; so neither can wee take the height of our Lords exaltation, but by measuring from the ground of his humiliation. The crosse is the Jacobs staffe whereby to take the elevation of this morning starre; and as Ezekiah was assured that fifteene yeeres were added forward to his life, by the going backe of the sunne ten degrees in the Diall of A∣haz, so wee know that 1500. yeares, nay eternity of life and glory is added
to our Saviour, by the going backe so many degrees in the Dyall of his pas∣sion, in the which the finger pointeth to these foure: 1 Humility. 2 Obedience. 3 Death. 4 Crosse. These selfe same steps and staires by which hee descended in his passion, he ascended in his exaltation; upon these therefore my discourse shall run, humility and the manner of his humilitie, obedience: his death and the manner of his death, his crosse. How low must the descent needs be, where humility and lowlinesse it selfe is the uppermost greece? Beneath it lyeth o∣bedience: for a man may bee humble in himselfe, and yet not voluntarily bow his necke to another mans yoake; Hee humbled himselfe, and became obedient. Obedient a man may bee, and yet not ready to lay downe his life at his Masters pleasure; hee became obedient unto death. Obedient to death a man may bee, and yet not willing to bee put to an infamous, cruell, and accursed death; he became obedient to death, even the death of the crosse. The repeating the word death seemeth to argue an ingemination of the punishment, a suffering death upon death. It was wonderfull that hee which was highest in glory should humble himselfe; yet it is more to bee obedient than to humble himselfe; more to suffer death willingly, or upon the com∣mand of another, than to be obedient; more to bee crucified than simply to die. Hee was so humble that hee became obedient, so obedient that hee yeelded to die, so yeelded to die as to bee crucified: his love wonderfully shewed it selfe in humbling himselfe to exalt us; his humility in his obe∣dience; his obedience in his patience; his patience in the death of the crosse. His humility was a kinde of excesse of his love, his obedience of his humi∣lity, his death of his obedience, his crosse of his death. He humbled himselfe. According to which nature? divine or humane? In some sort according to both: according to his divine, by assuming our na∣ture; according to his humane, by taking upon him our miseries. And became obedient. It is not said hee made himselfe obedient, because obedience presupposeth anothers command; wee may indeed of our selves offer service to another, but wee cannot performe obedience where there is no command of a Superiour; parere and imperare are relatives. To whom then became hee obedient? To God, saith Calvin; to Herod and Pilate, saith Zanchius; the truth is, to both: to God as supreme Judge, according to whose eternall decree; to Pilate, by whose immediate sentence hee was to suffer such things, of sinners, for sinners. To death. , whether inclusivè or exclusivè? whether is the mea∣ning, hee was obedient all his life, even to his last gaspe; or hee was so farre obedient, that hee yeelded himselfe to the wrath of God, to the scorn of men, the power of darknesse, the infamy of all punishments, the shame of all disgraces, the cruelty of all torments, the death of the crosse? The difference betweene these is in this, that the former maketh death the limit and bound, the latter an act of his obedience: to which interpretation I rather sub∣scribe, because it is certaine that Christ was not onely obedient unto the houre of his death, but in his death also, and after his death, lying three dayes and three nights in the grave. Here then we have the sum of the whole Gospel, the life and death of our Lord and Saviour: his birth and life in the
former words, He humbled himselfe: his death & passion in the latter, and be∣came obedient unto death, even the death of the crosse. He humbled, that is, took on him our nature & infirmities; & became obedient, that is, fulfilled the law for us by his active, & satisfied God for our transgressions by his passive obe∣dience. Obedience most shews it selfe in doing or suffering such things as are most crosse & repugnant to our wil & natural desires; as to part with that wch is most dear & pretious to us, and to entertain a liking of that which we o∣therwise most abhor. Now the strongest bent of all mens desires is to life & honor; nothing men fear more than death, especially a lingring painful death: they are confounded at nothing more than open shame: whereby our Savi∣ours obedience appeares a non pareil, who passed not for his life, nor refused the torments of a cruel, nor the shame of an ignominious death, that he might fulfill his fathers will, in laying down a sufficient ransom for all mankinde. Even the death of the crosse. As the sphere (of the Sun or Saturn, &c.) is na∣med from the Planet which is the most eminent part of it; so is the passion of Christ from his crosse: the crosse was as the center, in which all the bloody lines met. He sweat in his agony, bled in his scourging, was pricked in his crowning with thornes, scorned and derided in the judgement hall; but all this, and much more hee endured on the crosse. Whence we may observe more particularly, 1 The root. 2 Branches. 3 Fruit. Or, 1 The cause. 2 The parts. 3 The end of all his sufferings on it. 1 Of the cause. S.Aug. l. 3. de Civ. Dei. c. 15. Regularis defe∣ctio non nisi in lunae fine contingit. Austin demonstrateth that the Eclipse of the sun at the death of our Saviour was miraculous, because then the Moon was at the full. Had it bin a regular Eclipse the Moon should have lost her light, and not the Sun: so in the regular course of justice, the Church, which is compared to the Moon inCant. 6.10. Scripture, should have been eclipsed of the light of Gods counte∣nance, and not Christ, who is by the Prophet Malachy stiledMal. 4.2. Sol justitiae, the Sun of righteousnesse. But as then the Sun was eclipsed in stead of the Moon, so was Christ obscured in his passion for the Church; he became a surety for us, & therfore God laid all our debts upon him, to the uttermost farthing. The Prophet Esay assureth us hereof,Esa. 53.4, 5. He bare our infirmities, & carried our sor∣rows. He was wounded for our transgressions and broken for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, & by his stripes we are all healed. O the wonderfull wisdom & justice of God! the just is reputed unjust, that the unjust might be reputed just: the innocent is condemned, that the condemned might be found innocent: the Conquerer is in bonds to loose the captive: the Creditor in pri∣son to satisfie for the debtour: the Physitian taketh the bitter potion to cure the patient: the Judge is executed to acquit the prisoner. What did the welbeloved of his Father deserve, that he should drink the dregs of the vials of wrath? why should the immaculate Lamb be put to such torture, & in the end be slain, but for a sacrifice? why should the bread of life hunger, but for our gluttony? the fountain of grace thirst, but for our intemperancy? the word of God be speech∣lesse, but for our crying sin? truth it self be accused, but for our errors? inno∣cency condemned, but for our transgressions? why should the King of glory
endure such ignominy & shame, but for our shameful lives? why should the Lord of life be put to death, but for our hainous and most deadly sins? what spots had he to be washed? what lust to bee crucified? what ulcers to bee pricked? what sores to bee launced? Doubtlesse none at all: our corrupt blood was drawn out of his wounds, our swellings pricked with his thornes, our sores launced with his speare, our lusts crucified on his crosse, our staines washed away with his blood. It was the weight of our sins that made his soule heavie unto death, it was the unsupportable burden of our punishment that put him into a bloody sweat: all our blood was corrupt, all our flesh as it were in a scurfe, from theEsa. 1.6. crown of the head to the sole of the foot there was no soundnesse in us, nothing but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores. For a re∣medy hereof our Lord and Saviour was let blood in all parts of his body; in his head when he was crowned with thorns, in his hands and feet when he was pricked with nailes, in all the parts of his body when his flesh was torn with whips. After so much blood drawne from him, there could be little left, ex∣cept a few drops at the heart: behold these also are drawne out by the Soul∣diers speare. The Adamant, which nothing relenteth at the stroak of the ham∣mer, yet is broken in pieces by the warme blood of a goat. Beloved, if such abundance of the blood of the immaculate Lamb Christ Jesus, trickling from his temples, dropping from his stripes, running from his hands and feet, gu∣shing from the hole in his side, melt not our hearts, and resolve them into penitent teares, they are harder than Adamant: not a compassionate teare can we wring out of our eyes for him, who shed so much blood for us. We pray ordinarily, Remove, O Lord, from us our stony hearts, & give us hearts of flesh: but O Lord, saith Bonaventure, give me rather a stony heart, & remove from me my fleshly; for the stones clave at Christs passion, but the fleshly hearts of men clave not; the vaile rent it selfe at theMat. 27.51. hearing of the blasphemies a∣gainst the Son of God, yet we heare not of any of the standers by that they tare their garments; the sun drew in his beames, the heavens mourned in sa∣bles, the earth trembled for feare, the rocks were cleft as it were with indigna∣tion, the graves opened to receive his dead corps, & hide it from further indig∣nity: solus homo non compatitur, pro quo solo Christus patitur, only man suffers not with him, for whom only he suffered; only man shewes no compassion, to whom alone Christ intended all the benefit of his passion. Wee are affected at the hearing of a profane story, nay at the representation of some tragicall fiction we have teares at commands; yet (O Saviour let the merits of thy passion sa∣tisfie even for this our want of compassion for thee) when we read or heare out of the sacred story of the Evangelists, the most honorable personage that ever was, suffer the most shameful indignities that ever were; the innocentest person that ever was, laden with the most grievous & slanderous accusations that ever were; the justest that ever was put to the cruellest torments that e∣ver were, and all this for our sake: do we take it to heart? do his stripes make any impression in us? do the nailes and speare that pierced him pricke us with compunction? doe we compassionate his sorrow, admire his patience, mag∣nifie his love, detest our sins the causes of his sufferings? The custome in many places is, that if the sonne of a King commit a fault deserving punish∣ment, his Page or some other servant is whipp'd for him: and those Prin∣ces that are of tender natures, more grieve at the sight than their servant for
their suffering of a few stripes. Deare Christians, in Christs passion it was cleane otherwayes; for the Kings son, the heire apparent of heaven was scourged for his servants: what, said I, scourged? nay flayed with whips, nay buffetted with fists, smote with reeds, pricked with thornes, bored with nailes, pierced with a launce. We have viewed the root, let us now behold the branches; which some will have to be sixe, some five, some foure, some three. They which di∣vide Christs sufferings into sixe parts, terme them so many voyages or poastings: first, from his supper to the garden; secondly, from the garden to Annas; thirdly, from Annas to Caiaphas; fourthly, from Caiaphas to He∣rod; fifthly, from Herod to Pilat; sixthly, from Pilat to Golgotha. They who divide them into five, thus reckon them: first, his agonie: secondly, his taking: thirdly, his arraignement: fourthly, his sentence: fiftly, the execution. They who into foure, account upon, first, his afflictions before he was taken: secondly, the proceedings against him after he was taken by the Ecclesiasticall Judges: thirdly, before the secular: fourthly, the con∣summation of all, his death upon the Crosse. For brevity sake I re∣duce them to three: first, dolours and terrours: secondly, abuses and in∣dignities: thirdly, tortures and torments. The first in the Garden, the se∣cond in the Palace, the third on the Crosse. First, in the garden we finde him in an agonie. What an agonie is, sentitur priusquam dicitur, none can say but he that hath felt, and none ever felt such an agonie but our Saviour. Conceive we at the same time all the veines of our bodie streigned, all the sinewes stretched, all the bones racked, what paine must this needs be in the body? and how farre greater a like to this in the soule? This somewhat expresseth his agonie, which was an horrour conceived from the apprehension of his Fathers wrath, a conflict in his minde, and terrible combate in all the parts of his soule. Judge ye of the extremity of his first fit, both by the antecednts and the consequents; the antecedents, feare and consternation, coepit expavescere, &Mat. 26.37, 38. gravissimè angi, hee began to be affrighted and grievously troubled: torments they must needs be, and sorrowes more grievous than many deathes, at which the sonne of God was affighted. Secondly judge it by the consequents and effcts, a strange sweat, with clottie bloud trickling from all parts of his bo∣dy. What torments did not the blessed Martyrs endure? yet we never read that in any extremity they were cast intoLuke 22.44. a bloudie sweat. What labour must the minde needs be in when the body sweats bloud St.Languet Christus in bal∣neo sanguinis sui, & et, non tantum oculis, sed & omnibus membris. Bernard is bold to say, that he languished in this bath of his bloud; and not onely his eyes, but all parts of his body wept for us, and that with teares of bloud. We might well have thought that he would have gone away in this agonie and bloudie sweat, but that anLuke 22.43. Angel was sent to strengthen and comfort him, which was not done before nor after; and therefore we may well ima∣gine that now he was in the greatest distresse of all. Yet I gather this rather from his owne speeches, My soule is heavie untoMat. 26.38.42. death: Father, if it be possible let this cup passe from mee. It is impietie in the highest degree to thinke that any martyr or Saint was endued with a greater measure of pati∣ence than our Saviour: yet who of that noble armie when they were con∣demned to mercilesse torments, and saw before their eyes crosses, rackes,
fiery pincers, burning furnaces, teeth of wild beasts, and all the engines of cruelty and shapes of death, shewed such tokens of griefe, or uttered such speeches of regret and reluctancy? nay rather they for Christs sake desired them, and rejoyced in them. Something then it was above all the torments man can devise, much lesse beare, that our Saviour felt in his agony, and ex∣pressed by his bloudy sweat and strong cries. Whilest our Saviour was in this wofull plight, what doe his Disciples? Doe they condole him? pray with him? arme themselves to defend him? Nay, in this feare and per∣plexity of their Master they fall fast asleep at the first, & after in his greatest danger forsake him; only Judas commeth neere him, and saluteth him with a kisse. O that perfidious treachery should touch those lips in which there was no guile: that he should beCyp. de bon. patient. Insul∣tantium sputa∣mina excipe∣ret, qui sputo suo caeci oculos paulò ante for∣mastet: coro∣naretur spinis, qui Martyres floribus coro∣nat aeternis: palmis in faci∣em verberare∣tur, qui palmas veras vincenti∣bus tribuit: spoliaretur ve∣ste terrenâ, qui indumento immortalitatis caeteros vestit: cibaretur felle, qui cibum coelestem dedit: potaretur ace∣to, qui pocu∣lum salutare propinavit. spit upon, who cured the eyes of the blind with spittle: that his face should be smitten with palmes of the hand, who putteth palmes into the hands of all that overcome: that he should be crowned with thornes, who crownes Martyrs with never withering flowers: that he should be stripped of his earthly garments, who arraies us with celestiall robes: that hee should be fed with gall, who feeds us with bread from heaven: that vinegar should be given to him for drinke, who prepareth for us the cup of salvation! But before we goe out of the garden, we will gather some flowers. As the first sinne was committed in a garden, so the first satisfaction was made in a garden: in that garden there was an evill Angel tempting, in this garden a good Angel comforting. Adams sentence in that garden was, that hee should get his living with the sweat of his browes; and in this the second A∣dam procureth life unto us by the sweat of his whole body. Adam was driven out of that garden by an Angel brandishing a fiery blade, and our Saviour is fetched out of this with swords and staves, and brought into the high Priests palace, where he is most injuriously dealt withall; they cannot hold their hands off him whilest he is examined before the Judge, but, contrary to all law and good maners, they smite him with staves at his arraignment. Yea, but they were but rude souldiers, or fawning servants. Is there any more justice in the high Priest or the Councell, who not only take wil∣lingly any allegation against him, but also seeke out for false witnesses, and when they find none that were contests, yet they condemne him, and that for no ordinary crime, but for blasphemy in the highest degree? Neither were the Judges more unjust than the people mad against him, Away with him, say they, away with him, Crucifie him, crucifie him. Why? what evil hath he done? Spare Barabbas, not him. What? save a murderer, and murder a Saviour? O ye people of Judea, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, what so en∣rageth you against him? He hath cleansed your lepers, he hath cured your blind, he hath opened your deafe eares, he hath loosened your tongue-tyed, he hath healed your sicke, he hath raised your dead, he hath preached unto you the Gospel of the Kingdome, and the glad tidings of salvation; and is he not therefore worthy to live? He inviteth you to grace, Come unto mee all ye that are heavie laden; & unto glory, Come ye blessed of my Father: and therefore away with him, away with him? With these out cries Pilate is over∣borne, as if clamours of the promiscuous rout were to be taken for deposi∣tions of sworne witnesses, and hee pronounceth the unjustest sentence that ever was given, that Jesus was guilty of death. After the sentence execution
immediately ensueth; he is stript starke naked before the multitude (what would not an ingenuous man rather endure than this shame?) his flesh is torne with whips and scourges appointed for slaves, so cruelly, that Pilate himselfe, moved at so lamentable a spectacle, sheweth him to the people with an ecce homo, either to move them to pity, or to satisfie their bloud-thirsty appetite. As for the insolencies and indignities offered unto him by the souldiers, they are so odious and intolerable, that I cannot with pati∣ence relate them: and therefore I passe with our Saviour to Mount Calvarie; where foure great nailes were driven into the most tender and sinewy parts of his body, wherewith after he was fastened to the crosse, his crosse was set up in the midst betwixt two theeves, & the Mediatour of God and man now hangeth in the middle betwixt heaven and earth. I need not amplifie upon the death of the crosse, a death for the torment most grievous, most infamous amongst men, andDeut. 21.23 accursed of God himselfe. Any one may con∣ceive what a torment it must needs be, when the whole weight of the bo∣dy hangeth upon the wounds in the hands & feet. But there were foure cir∣cumstances which very much aggravated his passion: 1. The nature of his complexion; for being made of Virgins flesh, and thereby of the purest and exactest temper, hee could not but be more sensible of excruciating tor∣ments than any other. 2. The place and time; the place Jerusalem the Me∣tropolis of all Judea, the time at Easter when there was a concourse of peo∣ple from all parts of Palestine, besides an infinite multitude of strangers that came to see that great solemnity. 3. The sight of his mother and dearest Disciple: in their sight to be put to so infamous and cruell a death, what a corrasive must it needs be? This was the sword that pierced his mothers heart; and how thinke wee it affected him? his compassion was no lesse griefe to him than his passion. 4. The insolency of his adversaries now floc∣king about his crosse, and by their deriding scoffes and taunts powring shar∣pest vinegar into his wounds. To endure that which man never did nor could, to be put to all extremiy of tortures and torments, and not to be be∣moaned, nay to be mocked at and reviled (Others he hath saved, himselfe he cannot save: Thou that destroyedst the Temple, and buildedst it up againe in three dayes, come downe from the crosse, and we will beleeve thee.) O this is an hyperbole of misery! There are yet foure considerations, which put as it were a spirituall crosse upon his materiall, and more tortured his soule than the other his body. 1. His unconceivable griefe for the obstinacy of the Jewish nation. 2. The apprehension of the destruction of the City and Temple, with a desolation of the whole Country to ensue shortly after his death. 3. The guilt of the sins of the whole world. 4. The sense of the full wrath of his Father for the sinnes of mankind, which he tooke upon himselfe. And now ye have the full dosis, and all the ingredients of that bitter cup which our Saviour prayed thrice that itMat. 26.44. might passe from him. We have viewed the root and the branches, let us now gather some of the fruit of the tree of the crosse. Christs passion may be considered two maner of wayes: 1. Either as a story simply, 2. Or as Gospel.
The former consideration cannot but breed in us griefe & hatred; griefe for Christ his sufferings, and hatred of all that had their hand in his bloud: the latter will produce contrary affctions, joy for our salvation, and love of our Saviour. For to consider and meditate upon our Saviours passion as Gospel, is to conceive, and by a speciall faith to beleeve, that his prayers and strong cries are intercessions for us, his obedience our merit, his sufferings our satisfactions, that we are purged by his sweat, quit by his taking, clo∣thed by his stripping, healed by his stripes, justified by his accusations, ab∣solved by his condemnation, ransomed by his bloud, and saved by his crosse. These unspeakable benefits which ye have conceived by the Word, ye are now to receive by the Sacrament, if ye come prepared thereunto: for they who come prepared to participate of these holy mysteries, receive with them and by them, though not in them, the body and bloud of our Lord and Saviour, and thereby shall I say they become flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone? nay rather he becommeth flesh of their flesh, and bone of their bone. The spirit which raised him quickneth them, and preserveth in them the life of grace, and them to the life of glory. Howbeit, as the swee∣test meats turne intoCal. l. 4. instit. c. 14. sec. 40. Quemadmo∣dum sacrum hunc panem coenae Domini spiritualem es∣se cibum vide∣mus, suavem & delicatum non minus quàm salutiferum pi∣is Dei cultori∣bus, cujus gu∣stu sentiunt Christum esse suam vitam, quos ad grati∣arum actionem erigit, quibus ad mutuam in∣ter se charita∣tem exhortatio est: ita rursus in nocentissimum venenum omnibus vertitur, quorum fidem non alit: non aliter ac cibus corporalis ubi ventrem offendit vitiosis humoribus occupatum, ipse quoque vitiosus & corruptus nocet magis quàm nutrit. choler in a distempered stomach, so this heavenly Manna, this food of Angels, nay this food which Angels never tasted, proves no better than poyson to them, whose hearts are not purified by faith, nor their consciences purged by true repentance and charity from uncleannesse, worldlinesse, envie, malice, ranckour, and the like corrupt af∣fections. If a Noble man came to visit us, how would we cleanse and per∣fume our houses? what care would we take to have all the roomes swept, hung and dressed up in the best manner? Beloved Christians, we are even now to receive and entertaine the Prince of Heaven, and the Son of God; let us therefore cleanse the inward roomes of our soules by examination of our whole life, wash them with the water of our penitent teares, dresse them up with divine graces, which are the sweetest flowers of Paradise, perfume them with most fragrant spices and aromaticall odours, which are our servent prayers, zealous meditations, and elevated affectious, tuned to that high straine of the sweet Singer of Israel, Lift ye up, ye gates, and be yePsal. 24.9. lift up, ye everlasting doores, and the King of glory shall come in. Cui, &c.
THE REWARD OF PATIENCE. THE LII. SERMON. PHILIP. 2.9. Wherefore God hath also highly exalted him. Right Honourable, &c. THe drift of the blessed Apostle in the former part of this chapter, to which my Text cohereth, is to quench the fire-bals of contention cast among the Philippians by proud and ambitious spirits, who preached the Gospel of truth not in truth and sincerity, but in faction, and through emulation: (Phil. 1.15.) Some indeed preach Christ out of envie and strife. This fire kindled more and more by the breath of contradiction, and nourished by the ambition of the teachers, and factious partaking of the hearers, Saint Paul seeketh to lave out, partly with his owne teares, partly with Christs bloud, both which he mingleth in a passionate exhortation at the entrance of this chapter: If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels of mercies; fulfill yee my joy, bee yee like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through strife or vaine glory. Look not every man to his owne things, but every man also to the things of others. Let the same mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who being in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equall with God: But made himselfe of no reputation, &c. In this context all other parts are curiously woven one in the other, only there is a bracke at the fifth verse, which seemes to have no connexion at all with the former: for the former were part of a zealous admonition to brotherly love and christian
reconciliation, add this to voluntary obedience and humiliation: in those he perswaded them to goe together as friends, in this to give place one to the other: in those he earnestly beseecheth them to be of one mind among themselves, in this to be of the same mind with Christ Jesus. Now peace and obedience, love and humility seeme to have no great affinity one with the other; for though their natures be not adverse, yet they are very divers. Howbeit, if ye look neerer to the texture of this sacred discourse, ye shall find it all closely wrought, and that this exhortation to humility, to which my Text belongeth, hath good coherence with the former, and is perti∣nent to the maine scope of the Apostle; which was to re-unite the severed affections, and reconcile the different opinions of the faithfull among the Philippians, that they might all both agree in the love of the same truth, and seeke that truth in love. This his holy desire he could not effect, nor bring about his godly purpose, before he had beat down the partition wall that was betwixt them: which because it was erected by pride, could be no otherwise demolished than by humility. The contentions among the peo∣ple grew from emulation among the Pastors, and that from vaine glory. As sparkes are kindled by ascending of the smoake, so all quarrels and conten∣tions by ambitious spirits: theJudg. 5.16. divisions of Reuben are haughty thoughts of heart. A high conceit of their owne, and a low value and under rate of the gifts of others, usually keep men from yeelding one to the other upon good termes of Christian charity. Wherefore the Apostle, like a wise Physici∣an, applyeth his spirituall remedy not so much parti laesae, to the part where the malady brake forth, as to the cause, the vanitie of the Preachers, and pride of the hearers, after this manner: Christ humbled himselfe, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Crosse: therefore they who desire to be affected and liked of him, must be like affected to him, and not exalt themselves above others in pride, but rather abase them∣selves below them in humility; not behave themselves as lords over the faith of others, but rather demeane themselves as servants for Christs sake; not pursue ambitiously the glory of this world, but account it the greatest glory to partake with Christ in the infamy of the Crosse. How unfit and incongruous a thing is it in contention to preach the Gospel of peace? in rage and choler to treat of meeknesse? in malice and hatred to exhort to Christian love and reconciliation? in pride to commend hu∣mility? in vaine glory to erect the Crosse of Christ? that is to deny the power of it in so declaring it. Yet if they will needs bee ambitious, if their affections are so set upon glory and honour that nothing can take them off, let them take the readiest course to compasse their desire, which lyeth not in the higher way they have chosen, by advancing themselves, but in the lower way, which Christ took by abasing himselfe. For glory is of the nature of a Crocodile, which flyeth from them that pursue it, and pursueth them that flie it, as S.Hom. 7. ad. Philip. , &c. Chrysostome excellently declareth it: Glory (saith he) cannot be attained but by eschuing it; if thou makest after it, it ma∣keth away from thee; if thou flyest from it, it followeth thee; if thou desirest to be glorious, be not ambitious; for all truly honour them who affect not honour: as on the contrary they hold a base opinion of such as are ever aspiring to honour, and that for the most part without desert.
Two weighty reasons wee have in this verse to incline all Christian minds to obedient humility or humble obedience, a patterne of it and the reward thereof: he humbled himsefe so low, therefore God exalted him so high. Of the patterne most lively drawne in the life and especially the death of our Saviour, I have said something already, and shall more hereafter; yet can never say all. As Socrates spake of Philosophy, that it was nothing but meditatio mortis, a meditation upon death, we may of Divinity, that it is in a manner nothing else but meditatio mortis Christi, a meditation on Christs death: for the learnedest of all the Apostles would be knowne of no other knowledge that he had, or much esteemed but this, I1 Cor. 2.2. desire (saith he) to know nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.Lib. 7. nat. hist. c. 2. Gen Astoma radi∣ces florum se∣cum portat, longore itine∣re, ne desit ol∣factus. Pliny describeth unto us a strange kind of people in Africa, that had no mouthes, but received all their nourishment at their nostrils (which is nothing else but sweet smells and fra∣grant odours) who if they are to take any long journey, provide themselves of great store of flowers, and sweet wood, and aromaticall spices, lest they starve by the way. I will not warrant the narration, because I know it is a case over-ruled in Aristotles philosophy, that smells nourish not; but the application I can make good out of the Apostle, who calleth the Gospel and the Preachers thereof odorem vitae ad viam, a savour of2 Cor. 2.16. life unto life. Though the naturall life be not, yet the spirituall is nourished by odours & savours. And howsoever we are not in our bodies, yet in our soules we are Astomi, and, like those people of Africa, recive nourishment from sweet trees and roots. The sweet root we are alwayes to carry about us, is the root of the flower of Jesse: the savoury wood we are to smell unto, is the wood of the Crosse, that is, the tree of life in the midst of our Paradise. It is the ladder of Jacob whereby we ascend into heaven, it is the rod of Aaron that continually buddeth in the Church, it is the Juniper tree whose shade killeth the Serpent, it is the tree which was cast into the waters of Marah and made them sweet: no water so bitter, no affliction so brackish, to which the Crosse of Christ giveth not a sweet rellish. But to proceed from the effct of Christs passion in us, our comfort and salvation, to the effect of it in himselfe, his glory and exltation, expressed in the letter of my Text, Wherefore God hath also highly exalted him. Wherefore. Although there can be no cause given of Gods will, which is the cause of all causes; yet (as Aquinas teacheth us to distinguish) there may be ratio rei volitae, a reason of the thing willed by God: for God, accor∣ding to the counsell of his owne will, setteth divers things in such an order, that the former is the cause of the latter; yet none of them a cause, but an effect of his will. For example, in that golden chaine drawne by the Apo∣stle, Whom he hathRom. 8.29. predestinated those he hath called, whom he hath called he hath justified, whom he hath justified he hath glorified: predestination is a cause of vocation, vocation of justification, justification of glorification; yet all of these depend upon Gods will, and his will upon none of them. In like manner, God hath so disposed the causes of our salvation, that Christs in∣carnation and humiliation should goe before his glory and exaltation, & the one bee the meritorious cause of the other: yet neither of them is causa voluntatis divinae exaltantis, but ratio exaltationis volitae; neither of them a cause of Gods will exalting, but the former the reason of Christs exaltation, as willed by God.
God. Though Christ rose of himselfe, and, as himselfe speaketh, reared up the temple of his body after it was destroyed ratione suppositi, yet ratione principii it is most true, God raised him up: and therefore the Apostle saith else-where, that he wasJohn 2.19. raised by the right hand of God, that is, divine, power; but because this divine power was his owne, and essentiall to him as God, he may be truly said also to have raised himselfe. Hath highly exalted. Above the grave in his resurrection, above the earth in his ascension, above the heaven in his session at the right hand of his Fa∣ther. In the words highly exalted there is no tautologie, but an emphasis, which is all one as if he had said, Super omnem altitudinem exaltavit, super omnem potestatem evexit, he exalted him above all highnesse, he gave him a power above all powers, and a name above all names. Him. It is desputed among Divines, whether this him hath reference to Christ, considered as God or man: that is to say, whether he was exalted according to his humane nature only, or according to the divine also. Some later Expositors of good note, and by name Mr. Perkins on the Creed, re∣solve that Christ was exalted according to both natures; according to his humane, by laying down all infirmities of mans nature, and assuming to him∣self all qualities of glory: according to his divine, by the manifestation of the Godhead in the manhood, which before seemed to lie hid. But this seemeth not to be so proper an interpretation, neither can it be well conceived how that which is highest can be said to be exalted; but Christ (according to his divine nature) is and alwaies was, together with the Holy Ghost, most high in the glory of God the Father. It is true which they affirme, that the Deity more manifestly appeared in our Saviour after his resurrection than before, the rayes of divine Majesty were more conspicuous in him than before; but this commeth not home to the point. For this manifestation of the Deity in the humane nature, was no exaltation of the divine nature, but of the hu∣mane. As when the beames of the Sunne fall upon glasse, the glasse is illu∣strated thereby, not the beame; so the manifestation of the Deity in the humane nature of Christ, was the glory and exaltation of the manhood, not of the Godhead. I conclude this point therefore, according to the mind of the ancient and most of the later Interpreters, that God exalted Christ ac∣cording to that nature, which before was abased even unto the death of the Crosse: and that was apparently his humane. For according to his divine, as he could not be humbled by any, so neither be exalted: as he could not die, so neither be raised from death. Having thus parced the words, it remaineth that we make construction of the whole; which confirmeth to us a principall article of our faith, and giveth us thus much to understand concerning the present estate of our Lord and Saviour, That because being in the forme of God, clothed with majesty and honour, adored by Cherubins, Seraphins, Archangels and Angels, he dis-robed himselfe of his glorious attire, and put upon him the habit and forme of a servant, and in it, to satisfie for the sins of the whole world, en∣dured all indignities, disgraces, vexations, derisions, tortures and torments, and for the close of all death it selfe, yea that cruell, infamous and accur∣sed death of the Crosse: therefore God even his Father, to whom he thus far obeyed, and most humbly submitted himselfe, hath accordingly exalted
him, raising him from the dead, carrying him up in triumph into hea∣ven, setting him in a throne of Jasper at his right hand, investing him with robes of majesty and glory, conferring upon him all power and authority, and giving him a name above all names, and a stile above all earthly stiles, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, giving charge to all creatures of what rank or degree soever in heaven, earth, or under the earth, to honour him as their King and God, in such sort that they never speake or thinke of him without bowing the knee, and doing him the greatest reverence and religious respect that is possibly to be expressed. In this high mysterie of our faith five specialties are remarkable: 1 The cause, Wherefore. 2 The person advancing, God. 3 The advancement it selfe, exalted. 4 The manner, highly. 5 The person advanced, him. Begin we with the cause. Wherefore. That which was elsewhere spoken by our Saviour,Luk. 14.11. He that humbleth himselfe shall bee exalted, is here spoken of our Saviour, hee humbled himselfe to suffer a most accursed death, therefore God highly exalted him to a most blessed and glorious life. We are too well conceited of our selves, & gather too much from Gods love and gracious promises to us, if we expect that he should bring us by a nearer way and shorter cut to cele∣stiall glory, than he did his onely begotten Son; who came not easily by his crowne, but bought it dearly with a price, not which he gave, but rather for which hee was given himselfe. His conquest over death and hell, and the spoyles taken from them, were not Salmacida spolia, sine sanguine & sudore, spoyles got without sweat or blood-shed; for he sweat, and he bled; nay he sweat blood in his striving and struggling for them. Wherefore if God hum∣ble us by any grievous visitation, if by sicknesse, poverty, disgrace, or capti∣vity wee are brought low in the world, let us not bee too much dejected therewith; we are not fallen, nor can fall so low as our Saviour descended of himselfe immediately before his glorious exaltation. The lower a former wave carrieth downe the ship, the higher the later beareth it up: the farther backe the arrow is drawn, the farther forward it flyeth. Our affections as our actions are altogether preposterous and wrong: in the height of prosperity we are usually without feare, in the depth of misery without hope. Where∣as if we weighed all things in an equall ballance, and guided our judgement, not by sight, but by faith; not by present probabilities, but by antecedent certainties: we should find no place more dangerous to build our confidence upon, than the ridge of prosperity: no ground surer to cast the anchor of our hope upon, than the bottome of misery. How suddenly was Herod, who heard himself called a god and not a man, deprived of his kingdome & life by worms and no men? whereas David, who reputed himselfe a worm and no man, was made a King over men. Moses was taken from feeding sheepe, to feed the peo∣ple of God: but on the contrary, Nebuchadnezzar from feeding innu∣merable flockes of people, shall I say to feed sheepe? nay to be fed as a sheepe, and graze among the beasts of the field. O what a sudden change was here made in the state of this mighty Monarch? How was hee
that gloried in his building of great Babel brought to Babel, that is, confusi∣on? he that before dropp'd with sweet ointment, feasted all his senses with the pleasures of a King, hath the dew of heaven for his oyntment, the flowry earth for his carpets, the weeds for his sallets, the lowing of beasts for his musick, and the skie for his star-chamber. How great a fall also had the pride of Antiochus, who riding furiously in his chariot against Jerusalem, was thrown out of it on the ground, and with the fall so bruised his members, that his flesh rotted and bred wormes in great abundance?2 Mac. 9.8, 9. Hee that a little be∣fore thought that hee might command the waves of the sea (so proud was he be∣yond the condition of man) and weigh the high mountaines in a ballance, was now cast on the ground, and carryed in an horse-litter, declaring unto all the manifest power of God. So that the wormes came out of the bowels of this wic∣ked man in great abundance; and while hee was yet alive his flesh fell off with paine and torments, and all his army was grieved with the stench. TheXen. Cyr. paed l. 3. , &c. King of Armenia, who had beene formerly tributary to Cyrus, understanding that that puissant Prince was engaged in a dangerous warre with Croesus, worketh upon this advantage, rebels against Cyrus, and maketh himselfe an absolute Prince. But within a few dayes Cyrus having got the conquest of Croesus, turnes his forces against this rebell, taketh him, his wife and chil∣dren prisoners; yet upon his submission, above his hope and expectation, both giveth him his life and his crown, and putteth him in a better state than ever hee was. Whereupon that proud captivated, and humble restored Prince, acknowledging his treachery and folly, said, O how doth the wisdome of heaven over-shadow the providence of mortall men? how little are we aware of what may betide us? how glassy are our scepters? how brittle our estate? The other day when I made full account to have made my selfe a free absolute Monarch, I lost both liberty and crowne; and this day when I gave my selfe for gone, and looked every houre to have had my head strucke off, I have gained both pardon, liberty, and my crowne better settled than ever before. Such ex∣amples are so frequent, not onely in the sacred Annals of the Church, but also in profane stories, that a Philosopher being asked what God did in the world, answered, ,Hesiod. l. 1. , &c. he abaseth noble things, and ennobleth base; hee turneth Scepters into Mattockes, and Mattocks into Scepters; hee maketh hovels of palaces, and palaces of hovels; pulleth downe high things, and raiseth up low: agreeably to the words of the Prophet Esay,Esa. 40.4. Every valley shall bee exalted, and every hill brought low. Whence notwithstanding we are not to inferre. That God is more the God of the vales than of the hills, or that hee better esteemeth the low cottage of the beggar, than the high turrets of Princes: hee taketh no pleasure in the fall of any, much lesse of his deare children. It is not their broken estate, but their contrite heart; not their poverty in goods, but in spirit; not their lownesse of condition, but their lowlinesse of minde, which hee approveth and rewardeth, giving honour to that vertue which ascribeth all honour to him. The Apostle saith not, because Christ was humbled and put to so cruell and shamefull a death, therefore God highly exalted him; but because hee humbled himselfe. Which reason of the Apostle may bee confirmed, or at least illustrated by other paralle'd texts of Scripture:Pro. 29 23. The pride of a man
shall bring him low, but the humble spirit shall enjoy glory.Pro. 18.12. Before destructi∣on the heart of man is haughty, but before glory goeth lowlinesse.Job 22.29. When o∣thers are cast downe, thou shalt say, I am lifted up, and God shall save the hum∣ble: and,Luk. 1.52. Hee hath put downe the mighty from their seat, and hath exalted the lowly and meeke. Yea to honour and exalt them hee humbleth himselfe, andEsa. 57 15. commeth downe to dwell with them: for thus saith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place: with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. When a Prince rideth in progresse how much are they graced at whose house hee lieth but for a night? how far greater honour is done to the humble soul, with whom God lodgeth not for a night or abideth for a few dayes, but continually dwel∣leth? what can there bee wanting where God is, in whom are all things? how will he furnish his house? how will he set forth his rooms? how glori∣ously will hee beautifie and decke his closet and cabinet? I know not how God can raise the dwelling of the humble soule higher, who by his dwel∣ling in it hath made it equall to the highest heaven: I dwell, saith hee, in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit. There is no more difference betweene the seat of the blessed above the heavens, and the caves of the poorest servants of God under the earth, than between two royall palaces, the one higher the other lower built, but both equally honoured with the Court lying at them. In the weighing of gold the lightHorat. car. l. 1 Attollunt va∣cuum plus ni∣miò verticem. pieces rise up, but the weighty beare downe the scale; and surely they are but light who are lifted up in a selfe-conceit, but they who have true worth and weight in them are depressed in themselves, and beare downe towards the earth. Looke wee to the wisest of all the Philosophers, hee was the modestest; for his profession was, Hoc scio, quod nihil scio; This I know, that I know nothing. Looke wee to the learnedest of all the Greeke Fathers, Origen, hee was the most ingenuous; for his confession was, Ignorantiam meam non ignoro, I am not ignorant of mine owne ignorance. Looke wee to the most judicious and industrious of all the Latine, SaintAug. epist. ad Hieron. Austine, he was the humblest; for even in his heat of contention with Jerome hee acknow∣ledgeth him his better, Hieronymus Presbyter Augustino Episcopo major est, though the dignity of a Bishop exceed that of a Priest, yet Priest Jerome is a better or a greater man than Bishop Austine. Looke wee to the best of Kings, David, hee was the freest from pride;Psal. 131.1, 2 Lord, saith hee, I am not high-minded, I have no proud lookes, I doe not exercise my selfe in great mat∣ters, or in things too high for mee: surely I have behaved and quieted my selfe as a child that is weaned of his mother, my soul is even as a weaned child. Look wee to the noblest of all theTheodosius. Romane Emperours, his Motto was, Malo membrum esse Ecclesiae quàm caput Imperii; I account it a greater honour to bee a member of the Church than the head of the Empire. Looke wee to him that was not inferiour to the chiefe Apostles, surnamed Paulus (as some of the Ancient ghesse) quasi paululus, because hee was least in his owne eyes, not worthy to bee called an Apostle, as himselfe freely1 Cor. 15.9 Eph. 3.8. confesseth. Look we to the mirrour of all perfection, Christ Jesus, in whom are all the treasures of wisedome and grace, he setteth out humility as his chiefest jewell;Mat. 11.29. Learn of mee, saith he, that I am meeke and humble in heart. The raine falleth from the
hils, and settleth in the vales; and Gods blessings in like manner if they fall upon the high-minded and proud, yet they stay not with them, but passe and slide from them downe to the meeke and humble, where hee commandeth them to rest. The reason is evident why the humblest men are best; for grace alone maketh good, and a greater measure thereof better: nowJam. 4.6. God resi∣steth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble; and to the more humble the more grace, because they more desire it, and are more capable thereof. For the more empty the vessel is, the more liquor it receiveth; in like maner the more empty wee are in our owne conceits, the more heavenly grace GodMat. 11.25. infuseth into us. To him therefore let our soules continually gaspe as a thirsty land, let us pray to him for humility that wee may have grace, and more grace that wee may be continually more humble. Lord, who hast taught us that because thy Son our Saviour being in the forme of God humbled himselfe, and in his humility became obedient, and in his obedience suffered death, even the most ignominious, painfull, and accursed death of the crosse; thou hast exalted him highly above the grave in his resurrection, the earth in his ascension, above the starres of heaven in his session: establish our faith in his estate both of humiliation and exaltation, and grant that his humility may be our instruction, his o∣bedience our rule, his passion our satisfaction, his resurrection our justification, his ascension our improvement of sanctification, and his session at thy right hand our glorification. Amen. Deo Patri, Filio, & Sp. S. sit laus, &c.
LOWLINES EXALTED: OR Gloria Crocodilus. THE LIII. SERMON. PHIL. 2.9. Wherefore God hath also highly exalted him. Right Honourable, &c. WEe are come to keep holy the solemnest feast the Church ever appointed, to recount thankfully the greatest bene∣fit mankinde ever received, to celebrate joyfully the hap∣piest day time ever brought forth: and if the rising of the sun upon the earth make a naturall day in the Calendar of the world, shall not much more the rising of the Sun of righteousnesse out of the grave with his glorious beams, describe a festivall day in the Calendar of the Church? If the rest of God from the works of cre∣ation was a just cause of sanctifying a perpetuall Sabbath to the memory thereof; may not the rest of our Lord from the works of redemption, more painefull to him, more beneficiall to us, challenge the like prerogative of a day to be hallowed and consecrated unto it? shall we not keep it as a Sabbath on earth, which hath procured for us an everlasting Sabbath in heaven? The holy Apostles, and their Successors, who followed the true light of the world so near that they could not misse their way, thought it so meet and requisite, that upon this ground they changed the seventh day from the creation, appointed by God himselfe for aIgnat. epist. ad Magnes. .

The morall Law requiring a sevent part throughout the age of the world to be that way employed, though with us the day be charged in regard of a new revolution begun by our Saviour Christ; yet the same proportion of time continueth which was before, because in a reference to the benefit of creation, and now much more of renovati∣on thereunto added by him, which was the Prince of the world to come; wee are bound to account the sanctification of one day in seven, a duty which Gods immutable decree doth exact for ever. Sabbath, and fixed the Chri∣stian
Sabbath upon the first day of the weeke, to eternize the memory of our Lords resurrection. This day is the first borne of the Church feasts, the Prototypon and samplar Lords day, if I may so speak, from whence all the other throughout the yeere were drawne as patternes: this is as the Sunne it selfe, they are as the Parelii the Philosophers speake of, images and re∣presentations of that glorious light in bright clouds, like so many glasses set about the body thereof. With what solemnity then the highest Christian feast is to be celebrated, with what religion the christian Sabbath of sab∣baths is to be kept, with what affection the accomplishment of our redemp∣tion, the glorification of our bodies, the consummation of our happinesse the triumph of our Lord over death and hell, and ours in him and for him is to be recounted, with what preparation & holy reverence the Sacrament of our Lords body and bloud, which seales unto us these inestimable benefits, is to be received; with that solemnity, that religion, that affection, that pre∣paration, that elevation of our minds we are to offer this morning sacrifice. Wherefore I must intreat you to endeavour to raise your thoughts and af∣fections above their ordinary levell, that they fall not short of this high day, which as it representeth the raising and exaltation of the worlds Re∣deemer, so it selfe is raised and exalted above all other Christian feasts. Were our devotion key cold, and quite dead, yet mee thinkes that the rai∣sing of our Lord from the dead should revive it, and put new life and heat into it, as it drew the bodies of many Saints out of the graves to accompany our Lord into the holy City. After the Sun had bin in the eclipse for three houres, when the fountaine of light began againe to be opened, and the beames like streames run as before, how lightsome on the sudden was the world? how beautifull, being as it were new gilt with those precious raies? how joyfull and cheerfull were the countenances of all men? The Sunne of righteousnesse had been in a totall eclipse, not for three houres, but three whole dayes and nights, and then there was nothing but darknesse of sor∣ow over the face of the whole Church; but now hee appeares in greater glory than ever before; now he shineth in his full strength. What joy must this needs be to all that before sate in darknesse and in the shadow of death? In the deadest time of the yeere we celebrated joyfully the birth of our Lord out of the wombe of the Virgin, and shall we not this Spring as much rejoyce at his second birth, and springing out of the wombe of the earth? Then he was borne in humility, and swadled in clouts, now he is borne in majesty, and clothed with robes of glory; then he was borne to obey, now to rule; then to dye, now to live for ever; then to be nailed on the crosse at the right hand of a theefe, now to be settled on a throne at the right hand of his Father. As Cookes serve in sweet meats with sowre sawces, Musicians in their songs insert discords, to give rellish as it were to their concords, andCic. de orat. l. 3. Habeat summa illa laus umbram & recessum, ut id quod illu∣minatum est magis extare atque eminere videatur. Rhe∣toricians set off their figures by solaecismes or plaine sentences: in like man∣ner the Apostle, to extoll our Saviours exaltation the higher, depresseth his humiliation the lower; he expresseth his passion in the darkest colours, to make the glory of his resurrection appear the brighter, , he emp∣tied himselfe, word for word, made himselfe of no reputation, and took upon him the forme of a servant, and being found in fashion as a man he humbled
himselfe, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Crosse. Where∣fore God also , highly exalted him, Superexaltavit: as if ye would say, he highly raised him on high. The stroake is doubled upon the naile to drive it in further; the beame is reflected to give more light and heat; the word is repeated for more significancy and efficacy: as, Visitando visi∣tabo, and desiderando desideravi, and benedicendo benedicam, and gavisi sunt gaudio magno; a, inExod. 32.34. visiting I will visit, that is, I will most surely visit: and I haveLuke 22.15. desired with desire, that is, I have vehemently desired to eate this Passover: and the wise menMat. 2.10. rejoyced with joy to see the starre, that is, they exceedingly rejoyced: and inGen. 12.2, 3. blessing will I blesse thee, saith God to Abraham, that is, I will wonderfully, I will extraordinarily blesse thee with store of blessings; so here superexaltavit, he highly raised on high signifieth he raised him by many degrees, he exalted him to the highest ho∣nour he was capable of: so highly, that all creatures whatsoever are far be∣low him. In these two words, highly exalted, are wound up three Articles of our Christian Beliefe immediately following one the other in the Apo∣stles Creed, 1. Resurrection, 2. Ascension, 3. Session at the right hand of God. When he was raised from the dead, he was exalted; but when he ascended, and tooke his place at the right hand of God above all thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, he was highly exalted. As there are three de∣scents in his humiliation; his death, his going downe to Hell, his lying in the grave three dayes and three nights: so there are three ascents in his ex∣altation correspondent unto them; to the first degree of his humiliation, his death, answereth the first degree of his exaltation, his resurrection: to the second, his descent into hell, his ascension into heaven: to the third, his lying three dayes and three nights in the grave, which was the lowest degree of his humiliation, the highest degree of his exaltation, his sitting at the right hand of God. The sweet flower of Jesse, which was set at his death, and thrust deep into the ground at his buriall, is now sprung up from the earth in his resurrection, openeth his leaves, and sends forth a savour of life unto life to all that by faith smell unto it. But to keep to the words of my Text; the parts whereof resemble insecta animalia, those creeping things, which if you cut them asunder, will joyne againe: therefore is as the communis terminus to them all, because the Son of God was so farre humbled, it was fit he should be exalted accordingly; because he humbled himselfe, therefore God exalted him; because he hum∣bled himselfe so low, God exalted him so high: where humility goes be∣fore, there is a just cause of exaltation; and where there is a cause, God will exalt; and where God exalteth, he exalteth highly. Wherefore. It is hotly argued between the reformed Divines and Pa∣pists, Utrum Christus sibi meruerit; Whether Christ merited any thing for himselfe, or only for us. The Romanists stand for the first, the Protestants for the second opinion. I see no cause why this controversie should not be composed: for questionlesse Christs humiliation deserved an exaltation, neither can we attribute too much glory to our Redeemer. Albeit there∣fore
as Mediatour he merited for us, yet as man he might also merit for himselfe: and the word Quaproptet, Wherefore, seemeth rather to imply the meritorious cause of his exaltation, than a consequence only of the hy∣postaticall union. Where God exalteth, there is alwayes some cause; he advanced not his Son without merit. Whose example, if they (in whose gifts the greatest preferments are) did alwayes follow, the garlands of honours should not be taken from them that winne the race, and given to standers by. Cato was in the right, who said, he had rather that men should aske why hath Cato no statue or monument, rather than why should he have a monument? And surely it is a greater honour, that men should enquire why such a man of worth is not preferred, than why is such a man of no worth preferred; yet as in nature, so in states, the heaviest bodies will ascend ad supplendum vacuum, to fill up a vacuity. Worthlesse men, like Apes and Monkies, will not be quiet till they have got to the top of the house, and when they are there, what doe they but make mouthes and faces at passen∣gers, or breake glasses, or play other ridiculous feats? The old thorow∣faire to the Temple of honour among the Romans, was by the Temple of vertue; but now it is said men have found a neerer way through the postern gate of Juno Moneta. The ancient Philosophers did but dreame of a golden age, but we see it: Aurea nunc verê sunt secula, plurimus auro Venit honos, auro conciliatur amor. This may be well esteemed the golden age, in which gold is in greatest esteem. Gold supplies all defects, and answereth to all things: AExod. 32.6. Calfe shall be worshipped with divine honour, if he be of gold. But the best is, they that rise like Jonas gourd in a night, are blasted in an houre; and as they are rai∣sed no man knowes why, so they fall no man knowes how. It is not possi∣ble that a high and great building should stand without a foundation. Now if we will beleeve Saint Austine, the foundation of honour is worth, and this must be laid deep in the ground of humility. He humbled himselfe; therefore God highly exalted him. If Christ, who humbled and abased himselfe so low, be now so highly exalted above all principalities, and powers, and thrones, and dominions, there is no cause then why any of Gods children humbled under his hand, how low soever they are brought, should despaire of rising againe. Looke they upward or downward, they may fasten the anchor of their hope: beneath them our Sa∣viour was, who now is above the heavens. Are they spoiled of their goods? he was stripped starke naked. Have they left a great estate, he left a King∣dome in Heaven. Are they falsly accused? he was condemned of blasphe∣my. Are they railed at? he was spit upon. Are they pricked with griefes? he was crowned with thornes. Doe they lye hard? he hung upon the crosse. Doe they sigh for their grievous afflictions? he gave up the ghost in torments. Are they forsaken of their friends? he was for a time of his Father: (MyMat. 27.46. God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee?) Have they things laid to their charge they never knew? he was charged with the sins of the whole world, which pressed him downe to the earth, nay yet lower, to the grave; and yet behold he now sitteth at the right hand of God, and he who
was abased beneath the lowest creatures, is advanced above all, and all bow unto him. And therefore as the oake Ab ipso ducit opes animumque ferro. taketh heart as it were, and groweth by the stroake of the axe; and asJuel. in Apol. Eccles. Angl. An∣teus the Gyant recovered his strength by his fall on the ground: so should they take comfort from their afflictions, and gather arguments of their future exaltation from their present fall and humiliation. They are fallen and humbled, therefore in case to be raised; there is a why and a wherefore they should be exalted: they are in a good way to honour, wherein they may see our Saviours footsteps before them. God woundeth and healeth, he killeth and reviveth, he letteth his children downe to the gates of hell to terrefie them for their sinnes, and make them claspe about him, and lay faster hold on his promises; for he bringeth them backe againe. The solemnitie used at the inauguration of the Emperour of the Tartars somewhat resembleth Gods dealing with his children & the heires of the crowne of heaven.De rep. l. 1. c. 8. Rex de sublimi solio demovetur, & vilissimae tabu∣lae superposi∣tus humi con∣stituitur; ad quem Pontifex orationem convertens, Inspice coelum inquit, & De∣um praepoten∣tem universita∣tis regem in∣tuere & agno∣sce: si justè im∣peraveris, om∣nia ex animi tui sententiâ consequeris, sin muneris of∣ficiique tui obliviscaris, praeceps ex al∣to ac sublimi loco dejectus, regali potesta∣te & bonis om∣nibus spolia∣bere, ut ne ta∣bula quidem haec cui inside∣as tibi relin∣quatur. Bodin thus relateth it: When the Nobles and Peeres are assembled, the Prince to be crowned is taken out of a chaire of estate, and set upon a low stoole or planke on the ground: the Priest who is to sacre him useth these words, Looke up to heaven and acknowledge the sove∣raigne Commander of the whole world, and know that if thou rule justly, hee will establish thy Throne under thee, and settle the crowne upon thee: but if thou cast away all feare of him, and car of the peoples safetie and welfare, he will pull thee downe from thy high Throne, and lay thee on the ground, take all from thee that he hath given thee, and leave thee not so much as this sorry board thou sittest upon. After which words hee is invested with Princely robes, carried up in great state, set in his Imperiall Throne, crowned and proclaimed Emperour: in like manner, God before he advanceth his dea∣rest children, and putteth the Crowne of glory upon their heads, setteth them as it were upon a low planke, in some meane or deplorate condition up∣on earth, that they may humble themselves under that mighty hand of his, whichPsa. 113.6, 7. raiseth the poore out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dounghill, that he may set them even with the Princes of his people. Sith then God raiseth the poore from the dounghill to tread upon cloth of estate, and sit in the Throne of Princes, sith he advanceth men of smallest meanes to great estates, and casting the bright beames of his favour upon the lowest and obscurest hovells and cottages, maketh them illustrious and glori∣ous, why should any of Gods children by any extremity whatsoever be driven to resigne their estate in his promises? to close their owne eyes be∣fore they are dead? and yeeld up their last breath with sighes of griefe and groanes of despaire? They lye but in the dust, God raiseth from the doung∣hill, as he did Job; nay from the dungeon, as he did Daniel and Jeremy; nay yet lower, from the grave, as he did Lazarus; nay yet lower, from the neathermost hell, as he did our Saviour. Kings have long hands, An nescis longas regibus esse manus? and God hath out-stretched armes: there is no place so high which they cannot reach, and from thence plucke downe the proud: no depth so low, which they cannot sound, and from thence draw up the humble. The cele∣stiall bodies distill their influence downe to the lowest vales, which stayeth
not all there, but some part of it is conveighed yet lower, by pores & secret passages, even to the bosome and bowels of the earth, to the generation and perfection of the metalls and mineralls there: and shall we not thinke that the beames of Gods favour can carry downe the sweetest influences of his graces into the deepest dungeon of misery, and darkest chambers of death? If art can make of ashes and trash pure and shining glasse, if nature produceth gold of the basest of all the elements earth, and precious stones of excrementitious moisture; what marvell is it, that God should make scepters of mattockes, cedars of shrubs, and of those that are accounted the off-scouring of all things starres of heaven? No Christian doubteth of his power: all the question that can be made, is of his will; and thereof we can make no question that heare his gracious promise, that hee thatLuk. 14.11. hum∣bleth himselfe shall be exalted. Why then are not all that are humbled exal∣ted? A short answer may be, because they humble not themselves as Christ here did, neither are truly humbled. All that are throwne downe presently doe not yeeld; sicknesse may bring the body low, and calamity the estate lower, and yet the mind be high and haughty: and that de facto they are not humble, who complaine that they are not raised, their repining at others preferment, and their staying behind them maketh it manifest. For nothing is so repugnant to humility as ambition: (ambition is of the Eagle and Fal∣cons brood, it soareth aloft; but humility is è genere reptilium, of the na∣ture of wormes that creep on the ground.) He whom humility truly in∣formeth how small his deserts, how great his defects are, how vaine the pompes of this world, how secure a quiet and retired life, cannot inor∣dinately desire preferment, which in his judgement is not preferment, sith he preferreth a lower estate above it, as more sutable to the lowlinesse of his mind. With this two-forked ram therefore we may push downe all the forts which discontented spirits raise against the divine providence: if they are truly humble, they desire not to be exalted; if they are not hum∣ble, they deserve not. Howbeit, the cunning painter of vices in the tables of mens hearts set∣teth such a faire colour upon ambition, that he sometimes deceiveth hum∣ble Christians, and ere they are aware, maketh them enamoured with it. The colour is the advancement of Gods glory by their preferment: for these or the like thoughts hee suggesteth, God hath bestowed upon you some eminent gifts or graces, this to deny were not humility, but unthank∣fulnesse; to bury these in oblivion and obscurity, cannot but be prejudici∣all to his glory: therefore sith his commandement is,Mat. 5.16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your workes, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven, it is your part to endeavour to take your candle from under the bushell which covereth it, and set it on a high candlesticke, that is, some eminent place of dignity in Church or Common-wealth, that it may give light to the whole house of God. But latet anguis in herbâ, there lyeth a foule affection under this faire pretence. For such as are overtaken with this temp∣tation of Sathan, seeke not their owne advancement for Gods glory, but Gods glory (if so at all they seeke it) for their owne advancement: they pray that the Sunne may cleerly shew forth his beames, but it is, that their gifts, which are but as moates in comparison, may be seen and glissen in his
raies. They are like false friends and cunning spokesmen, they beare the world in hand that they wooe for God, but they speake for themselves. Other∣wise it would be indifferent to them, if any other of as good or better parts than themselves, should be preferred to those dignities they aspire unto: and howsoever they could not but rest satisfied with the answer of God himselfe, I haveJoh. 12.28. glorified my name, and will glorifie it. God hath a greater care of his glory than they can have: neither is there one only way by which he setteth forth his glory; for the wayes of the Lord are mercy and justice. All that are exalted are not exalted in mercy, some are exalted in justice, as malefactors are carried up to a high scaffold for more exemplary punishment. God bestoweth no gifts in vaine, he will make the best bene∣fit and advantage for his glory, feare they it not: he knoweth the value of all the jewells of his grace, and he will sort and ranke them where they may most decke and adorne his Spouse, take they no care for it. As for their condition, what doth their obscurity and privacy disparage them? their Father who seeth their good parts in secret will reward them openly. I fore-see what may be further objected against the doctrine delivered; if he that humbleth himselfe shall be exalted, how commeth it to passe, that none are usually more vilified and dis-esteemed, than they who make them∣selves cheap? Tanti eris, quanti te feceris, a man is accounted of according to that he valueth himselfe: his gifts of mind and body are never thought worth more than himselfe priseth them at. Who get sooner into the high∣est places of preferment, than those who are still climbing? Doth not pride and ambition exalt many? or at least are not those that are in high places high minded? and consequently, neither are the humble exalted, nor those that are exalted humble? I answer that the proud are often exalted in this world, yet not by God; but either by the world, who like a cunning wrest∣ler, lifteth up his adversary above ground to give him the greater fall: or by the Divell, who doth his best by his instruments to set them in high pla∣ces, that through giddinesse they may fall and ruine themselves: Or if it be by God, it is in justice, not in mercy, as souldiers condemned to the stra∣pado, are drawne up to the highest round, that they may be more tortu∣red in their fall. My collection out of this Text standeth yet firme, None are exalted by God in mercy, especially to a Crowne in heaven, of which the Apostle here speaketh, but such as are dejected in themselves, and beare a low saile in their minds. For God acknowledgeth none for his but those that deny themselves; he is pleased with none, but those that are dis∣pleased with themselves: he accounteth none worthy of honour, but those that account themselves unworthy. Now the reason why God exalteth the humble is apparent; for he hath promised, Honorantes me honorabo; Them that1 Sam. 2.30. honour mee, I will honour: and none more honoureth God than the humble, who ascribeth nothing to himselfe but all to God. If Princes most willingly advance those to high places under them, who they are perswaded will most honour them, and doe them best service in their offices; whom then should God rather raise than the humble, who the more they are exalted, the more they extoll him? the more glorious they are, the more they glorifie him? the more light of honour they receive, the more they reflect backe? Besides, to
whom is honour more due than to those who flye it? who fitter to go∣verne than they who know best what it is to obey? who are like to be freer from oppressing and depressing others, than they who in the height of their fortune most deject their minds? Those vertues which are most at∣tractive, and are aptest to win our love and affection, are all either parts or adjuncts of humility. None so religious as the humble, who by so much hath a higher conceit of God by how much he hath the lower of himselfe. None so thankfull as hee, who acknowledgeth all Gods blessings un∣due. None so patient as hee, who acknowledgeth all the chastisements that are inflicted upon him most due unto him. None so obedient as hee, who utterly denieth himselfe, and bringeth every thought in subjection to Gods Word. None so fervent in prayer as he, who is most sensible of his wants. None so penitent as he, who abhorreth himselfe for his sinnes, and repenteth in dust and ashes. None so mercifull as he, who accounteth him∣selfe the greatest offender. None so free in contribution to others as hee, who maketh reckoning that any better deserves Gods blessings than him∣selfe. These graces and beautifull ornaments of the humble soule kindle an affection in God himselfe, and shall they not inflame our love to this ver∣tue? Looke we not to the acts of it, which seem vile and base, but to the effects, which are glorious and honourable: It is calledMat. 5.3. poverty in spirit, yet it enricheth the soule; it is in name and nature lowlinesse, yet it exal∣teth; it is vile in the eyes of the world, but precious in Gods esteem. The grasse upon the house top withereth, and the July-flowers on the wall soon lose their sent; but the Violets and other flowers that grow neere to the ground smell sweeter, and last longer. What doe the twelve precious stones shining in the foundation of the heavenly Jerusalem signifie, but so many Christian vertues laid in the ground of humility? Neither let it trou∣ble any, that men who put not themselves forth, though they are of extra∣ordinary parts, are often forgotten in states, and neglected by those who should tabulas benè pictas collocare in bono lumine, bring them into the light: for such men are most fitly compared to the statues of Brutus and Cassius, that were not brought forth nor carried with the rest in the fune∣ralls of Junia, of whom the wise Historian saith, Eo ipso praefulgebant quod non visebantur. If true honour, as all wise men judge, consist not in pomp and retinue, or lands, or possessions, or houses, plate, or jewells, but in the judgement and estimation of vertue; doubtlesse they have more true ho∣nour done unto them, whom the best reverence in their minds for their e∣minent gifts and graces, how obscure soever their condition and place be, than those of lesse or no worth, to whose office and place they give the cap and knee. When the Asse that carried the Idoll of Isis upon his backe, saw all the people fall downe before the goddesse, he lift up his head, and kicked up his heeles, and never left braying, as being proud of so great honour done unto him: which folly of the silly beast the people checked in such sort for the present, that it grew afterwards for a Proverbe, Non tibi, sedEras. chil. Isidi; Alas, stupid beast, the worship is not performed to thee, but to the image which thou bearest. I know ye prevent mee in the application; and therefore I presse these things no further: only give mee leave to offer to them, who are out-stripped by men of inferiour quality in their way of
preferment, these considerations following. That the coale which is healed in the ashes liveth, when that which is raked out and blowne soone dieth: the jewell in the casket is safe and most resplendent, when that which is ta∣ken out and worne is soyled or lost. Publike offices and eminent places in Church and Commonwealth expose those that hold them to the view of all; as their good parts are taken notice of, so their bad cannot bee concea∣led. Now if any man or woman otherwayes faire or beautifull, should yet have some one foule deformity in their face, were it a cut, or scarre, or boile, or botch, or the like, would they desire much to bee seene? would they not either keepe in, or by a maske or vaile cover this imperfection? Belo∣ved Christians, there is none that hath not some or other greater imperfecti∣on in his minde, than any deformity in the body can bee. Privacie, and pla∣ces of small or meane employment cast a vaile over those infirmities and imperfections, in such sort that none or very few espy them; publike cal∣lings, and places of great action discover them to the view of all. In which consideration if wee compare one with the other, the setting forth of their vices and imperfections, with the blazing of their vertues and good parts, if they have any; I am perswaded that never any proud and worthlesse, or vaine-glorious, or ambitious person obtained their end, the constant ap∣plause and praise of men. For though for a time they are upon the tongue of all, and entertained with greatest acclamations before their blinde sides and manifold imperfections are known; yet after veritas temporis filia hath brought in her evidence against them, their acclamations are turned into ex∣clamations against them, & their name putrefieth even whilest yet they are alive. If a Souldier that hath done good service in a countrey where there were no good coyne, but brasse or lead pieces made currant by the Princes command for the present necessity, should have this condition offered him, that if hee would bee content with so much of his pay as might defray his necessary charge, and forbeare the rest till hee returned to his owne coun∣trey, hee should receive so much in quantity in the purest gold as he might there in basest coine; could hee except against it? nay should hee not be very unwise to refuse so good an offer? The like condition is propounded by God unto them that daily fight his battels; for the good service they doe, and the losses, wounds, infamy, or disgrace they suffer, glory and honour is due unto them, at least by promise: the glory of this world is of lesse value in comparison of celestiall, than the basest coine in comparison of the purest gold; yet the countrey wherein they serve (this earth) affor∣deth no better: but if they forbeare till they returne to their owne home in heaven, there they shall receive gold for copper, pearle for glasse, a massie crowne of gold for a gilt paper coronet, glory from God and his Angels for glory from men. Lastly, the words of the Apostle Saint Peter are very remarkable to this purpose,1 Pet. 5.6. Humble your selves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: they who are not yet may be exalted in due time, if the due time fall by their life time, no man shall be able to crosse them in their advancement, nor defeat them of it: if not, they cannot commence any suit of unkindnesse against our gracious God for not exalting them sooner than he did the greatest instruments of his glory, the Prophets and Apostles, nay
and his only begotten Son, who became obedient unto death before he ex∣alted him. The belssed Apostle S. Paul expected not his garland before he had2 Tim. 4.8. I have finished my course, I have kept the faith, therefore is laid vp for me a crowne of righteousnesse. run his race; neither did any of the Roman Captains think it long to stay for their donatives till the day of triumph, when they received a Crowne from the Emperour, not below in the streets, but above in the Capitoll. Our day of triumph is the day of judgment, when we are to receive a crown of righteousnesse, not on earth, but in heaven. In the meane while, if any preferments or honours bee cast upon us, let us not esteeme them as our hire, but take them onely as earnests: but if wee lead our life ingloriously, and breath out our last breath in silence and obscurity, let this bee our solace, that as there can bee no darknesse where the sunne shineth, so neither is there any place to bee accounted private or inglorious where God and his Angels are present. There needs no other proofe where God is an eye-witnesse of our labours and performance, no applauders where his Angels are specta∣tors. I fill up this border therefore with a flower taken from SaintCyp. l. 4. ep. 5. Nec minor est martyrii gloria non publicè & inter multos periisse, cùm pereundi causa sit prop∣ter Christum: perire sufficit ad testimoni∣um martyrii testis ille qui martyres pro∣bat & coronat. Et ib. Solus non est cui Christus in fu∣gâ comes est, solus non est qui templum Dei servat, ubicunque fue∣rit sine Deo non est. Cypri∣ans samplar. This Martyr understanding of the discontent taken by some Martyrs in his dayes, that the Proconsull had so ordered that they should bee put to death privately, and thereby made Martyres sine martyribus, witnesses deposing for the faith of Christ without any to testifie their con∣stancy, or take example by their patience; thus hee quieteth their mindes: The glory of your martyrdome, saith hee, is nothing eclipsed by the privacy of your suffering, so the cause be for the faith of Christ it will bee abundantly suffi∣cient proofe of your patience, and assurance to you of your reward, that hee for whom you suffer seeth what you suffer, and that hee is your witnesse who will bee your rewarder and crowner, even God himselfe. And so I fall upon the next circumstance, the person exalting. Wherefore God highly exalted him. Hee humbled himselfe, but God exalted him. The fruit which wee are to gather from this branch of my text is like to the former; yet there is a difference betweene them: the former qualified and pacified the minde from murmuring and discontent at our present estate and calling, how low and mean soever it were; this keepeth it from aspiring thoughts,Mat. 23.12. and unwarrantable projects and attempts for the raising of our fortunes,Luk. 14.11. and advancing our estate. Before the burden of our song was, He that humbleth himselfe shall bee exalted; but now it is, He that exalteth him∣selfe shall be brought low. The latter is as true as the former, both were utte∣red with one breath by our Saviour. As not hee that commendeth himselfe is to bee commended, so neither is hee that exalteth himselfe to bee appro∣ved, but hee whom God exalteth. If any might ever have magnified and exalted himselfe, certainly our Lord and Saviour might best, who both spake as never man spake, and did as never man did, and suffered what never man did or could suffer; yet hee himselfe professeth,Joh. 8.14. If I honour my selfe mine honour is nothing, it is my Father that honoureth mee. Hee honoureth and exalteth himselfe who either vainegloriously setteth forth his owne wares, blazoneth his owne armes, and is the trumpet of his owne praises: or hee who ambitiously desireth such dignities and preferments whereof hee is unworthy, or useth indirect meanes to compasse those places whereof he might otherwise bee worthy and capable. This vitious affection is discri∣ed inJoh. 3.9. Diotrephes, noted in theLuk. 20.46. Pharisees, sharply censured in theMat. 20.26. Di∣sciples,
severely punished in Adoniah, Seba, Absalom, and Haman. Jacob saw in his vision Angels ascending upon a ladder to heaven; what need An∣gels goe by steps to heaven, who being spirits (as the Schooles teach) can mount thither and backe againe in an instant? might it not bee to teach us that Magistrates and Ministers, who are both in Scripture stiled Angels, are not suddenly to leape or hastily to climbe up to places of preferment, but ascend by degrees when God setteth a ladder for them? Thistle-down, and feathers, and vapours, and other light and imperfect mist bodies raise them∣selves from the earth; but pretious metall, and all perfect mist bodies move not upwards but perforce. Trajan, if wee may beleevePanegeric. Trajan. Nihil magis à te sub∣jecti animo fa∣ctum est, quàm quod coepisti imperare. Pliny, was in no∣thing more over-ruled by Nerva than in taking the rule of the Empire into his hand. What violence was used to Saint Austine and Ambrose at their in∣vestiture? the one wept, the other hid himselfe for a while, both hung off and drew backe with all their strength. How doth SaintEp. 7. & 26. Durum valdè fuit, &c. Us{que} ad terram me superposito o∣nere depressi∣stis. Gregory com∣plaine of them that chose him Bishop of Rome? What have yee done my friends? ye have laid such a burden upon me that presseth me down to the earth, in such sort that I cannot lift up my minde to the contemplation of the things that are above. Publike charges, and eminent places, besides the great trou∣bles they bring with them, expose them that hold them to great perils and dangers: —Graviore lapsu Decidunt turres, feriunt{que} summos Fulmina montes. The high hills are strucke with thunderbolts, the tops of trees blasted with lightnings, the pinacles of Temples, and fanes of turrets, and weather∣cockes of steeples are frequently blowne downe with the winde, and all the storme, and violence of weather beateth upon the roofes and tops of hou∣ses: Qui jacet in terrâ non habet unde cadat. The opposition betweene the members of these two verses is very ob∣servable, Hee humbled himselfe so low, therefore God exalted him so high. When man humbleth himselfe God exalteth, but when man exalteth him∣selfe God humbleth: how much better is it to humble our selves and be ex∣alted by God, than to exalt our selves and to be humbled by him. As none can raise so high, so none can pull downe so low as hee. Lucifer who would have exalted himselfe above the starres of heaven, was throwne downe be∣low the wormes of the earth: contrariwise, our Saviour who humbled himselfe beneath the earth, even to the gates of hell, was raised by God a∣bove the highest heavens.1 Pet. 1.5, 6. My exhortation therefore unto you is the same with that of the Apostle S. Peter: Humble your selves under the mighty hand of God, that hee may exalt you in due time: submit your selves one to another, decke your selves inwardly with lowlinesse of minde. There is no vertue drawn by the pensill of God in more lively colours,Psal. 113.6, 7. Esay 57.15. Mat. 11.25. Jam. 4.6, 10. Psal. 113.8. Mat. 5.3. with brighter beames of his favour shining upon them, than it: for hee that dwelleth in the highest hea∣vens hath respect to the lowest and lowliest, hee visiteth them, and dwelleth with them, hee familiarly converseth with them, and revealeth unto them his secrets:
hee bestoweth on them the treasures of his grace, hee raiseth them and ad∣vanceth them to a kingdome on earth, yea to a kingdome in heaven. To which kingdome the Lord exalt us for the merit of Christ Jesus, who humbled himselfe, and became obedient to death, even the death of the crosse; wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and hath given him a name above all names, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue confesse that Christ is the Lord, to the glo∣ry of God the Father. To whom, &c.
A SUMMONS TO REPENTANCE. THE LIV. SERMON. EZEK. 18.23. Have I any desire at all that the wicked should dye, saith the Lord God? Right Honourable, &c. WEE read in our Calendars of some things that come in at one season and goe out at another; but sinne is not of that nature, it is alwayes comming in, but never goeth out till our exit out of this world. Therefore nothing is more necessary at any time, or more seasonable at all times, than the doctrine of repentance: wee cannot heare too often of it, becausePsal. 19.12. none knoweth how oft hee offendeth. Such is the weaknesse of our nature, and the slipperinesse of our way inApoc. 15.2. this sea of glasse whereupon wee walke, that wee slip and fall daily, and are often maimed and wounded by our falls; and unlesse by grace the use of our limbes bee restored unto us and wee raised up by repentance, wee lye as a prey for the Devill,1 Pet. 5.8. who runneth about like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour. Let it then not seem grievous unto you to punish and2 Cor. 7.11. take re∣venge of your selves often, who transgresse more often: to afflict your soules often, whoEph. 4.30. grieve Gods holy spirit more often, whereby yee are sealed to the day of redemption. Sit par medicina vulneri, let the remedy bee answerable to the malady, let the plaister fit the wound; if the wounds be many let the plaisters be divers, if the wounds bee wide let the plaisters bee large. Now to perswade all that heare mee this day willingly to apply these smarting plaisters, to undertake joyfully this taske of godly sorrow, and perform chear∣fully
this necessary duety of mourning for our sinnes, I have chosen this Text: wherein God by expressing his desire of the life of a penitent sinner, assureth us that wee shall obtaine our desires, and recover the health of our soule if wee take the Physicke hee prescribeth. Have I any desire that a sinner should dye, and not that hee should returne from his wicked way and live?Vers. 22, 24. If the wicked shall turne from all his sinnes that hee hath committed, and keepe all my statutes, and doe that which is lawfull and right, hee shall surely live, hee shall not dye. All his transgressions that hee hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him; in his righteousnesse that hee hath done, hee shall live. But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousnesse and committeth iniquity, and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth, shall hee live? All the righteousnesse that hee hath done shall not bee mentioned: in his trespasse that hee hath tres∣passed, and in his sinne that hee hath sinned, in them hee shall dye. That is briefly, If repentance follow after sinne, life shall follow after repentance; if sinne follow finally after repentance, death shall follow after sinne. O pre∣sumptuous sinner despaire not, for repentance without relapse is assured life: O desperate sinner presume not, for relapse without repentance is certaine death. Art thou freed from desperation? take heed how thou presumest: hast thou presumed? yet by no meanes despaire. Nec spera ut pecces, nec despera si peccasti; Neither hope that thou maist continue in sinne, neither despaire after thou hast sinned, but pray and labour for repentance never to bee2 Cor. 7.10. repented of. But before I pitch upon the interpretation of the words, give mee leave to glance at the occasion, which was a Proverbiall speech taken up by the Jewes in those dayes wherein Ezekiel prophecied;Ch. 18..2. (TheJer. 31.29. In those dayes they shall say no more, the fa∣thers have ea∣ten a sowre grape, and the childrens teeth are set on edge. fathers have eaten sowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge:) of which wee may say asVell. Pater. hist. l. 2. Diser∣tus, sed nequā, & facundus, sed malo pub∣lico. Velleius Paterculus doth of Curio, It is a witty, but a wicked Proverb, casting a blot of injustice upon the proceedings of the Judge of all flesh.Aristot. l. de mirabil. auscul. Aristotle reporteth it for a certaine truth, That vulturs cannot away with sweet oyntments; and that the Cantharides are killed and dye suddenly with the strong sent and smell of roses: which makes it seeme lesse strange to mee that the doctrine of the Gospel, which is a savour of life unto life, should prove to some no better than a savour of death unto death: and the judgements of God which were sweeter to Davids taste than the honey and the honey comb, should taste so sower and sharpe in the mouthes of these Jewes (with whom the Prophet had to doe) that they set their teeth on edge, and their tongue al∣so against God himselfe; whom they sticke not to charge with injustice for laying the fathers sinnes to the sonnes charge, and requiring satisfaction of the one for the other. Our fathers, say they, have eaten sowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge: What justice is there in this? why should wee smart for our forefathers sinnes? and lye by it for their debt? The de∣pulsion of which calumny is the argument of this Chapter; wherin the Pro∣phet cleareth the justice of God from the former foule aspersion, both by denying the instance, and disproving the inference upon it. They were not, saith hee, the grapes your fathers ate that have set your teeth on edge, but the sowre fruit of your owne sinne. Neither doth God seeke occasion to pu∣nish you undeservedly, who is willing to remit the most deserved punish∣ments
of your former sinnes, upon your present sorrow and future amend∣ment. So far is he from laying the blame of your fathers sinnes upon you, that he will not proceed against you for your owne sins, if you take a course hereafter to discharge your consciences of them. The sufficiency of which answer will appeare more fully, by laying it to the former objection; which may be thus propounded in forme: He who punisheth the children for the fathers fault, offereth hard and uneven measure to the children. But God threateneth to doe so, and he oftenPlut. de ser. num. vind. An∣tigonus prop∣ter Demetri∣um, Phylenus propter Augae∣um, Nestor propter Nele∣um poenas sustinuere. Hes. op. & diei. .

ForHerod. in Clio Croesus quin∣tae retrò aetatis poenas luit, hoc est, Aba∣vus, qui cùm esset satelles, Heraclidum Dominum in∣teremit. Croesus lost his kingdome for the sinne of his great great great grand-father. Rhehoboam the ten Tribes for the sinnes of Solomon. The posterity of Ahab was utterly destroyed for the sin of their parents: and upon the Jewes forty yeeres after the death of our Saviour there came all the righteous bloud shed upon that land, from the bloud of righteous Abel, unto the bloud of Zacharias the sonne of Barachias, whom they slew between the Temple and the Altar.Matth. 23.35, 36. Verely (saith our Saviour) all these things shall come upon this generation. Ergo, God offereth hard and uneven measure to the children. In which Syllogisme, though the major or first proposition will hardly beare scale in the uneven ballances of mans judgement, (for in some case the sonne loseth his honour for his fathers sake, as of treason) yet the Prophet taketh no exception at it, but shapes his answer to the assumpti∣on, which is this in effect, that their accusation is a false calumny, that he that eateth the sowre grapes his teeth shall be set on edge: that the sonne shall not beare the iniquity of his father, but that the soule which sinneth shall dye. For howsoever God may sometimes spare the father for many excellent vertues, and yet cut off the sonne for the same sinne; because he is heire of his fathers vices, but not of his vertues: or he may launce sometimes the sinne in the sonne, when it is ripe, which he permitted to grow in the fa∣ther without applying any such remedy outwardly unto it: yet this is most certaine, that he never visiteth the sinne of the father upon the children, if the children tread not in the wicked steps of their father. Thus much the words that follow in the second Commandement imply, unto theExod. 20.5. third and fourth generation of them that hate mee. He often sheweth mercy to the sonne for the fathers sake, but never executeth justice upon any but for their owne sinnes. The sinne of the sonne growes the more unpardonable, because he would not take example by his father, but abused the long-suffering of God, which should have called him to repentance. The Latine Proverb (Ae∣milius fecit, plectitur Rutilius; Aemilius committeth the trespasse, and Ru∣tilius was merced for it) hath no place in Gods proceedings, neither is there any ground of the Poets commination, Hor. l. 3. od. 6. & lib. 1. od. 28. Negligis im∣meritis nocitu∣ram postmodo te natis frau∣dem commit∣ter: fors & de∣bita jura vices∣que superbae te maneant ip∣sum. Delicta majorum immeritus lues Romane. For God is so far from inflicting punishment upon one for the sins of an∣other, that he inflicteth no punishment upon any for his own sinne or sins, be they never so many and grievous, if he turne from his wicked wayes, and cry for mercy in time: for God desireth not the death of a sinner, but of sinne: he would not that we should dye in our sinnes, but our sinnes in us.
If we spare not our sinnes, but slay them with the sword of the Spirit, God will spare us. This is the effect of the Prophets answer, the summe of this chapter, and the contents of this verse: in which more particularly we are to observe, 1. The person, I. 2. The action or affection, desire. 3. The object, death. 4. The subject, the wicked. 1. The person soveraigne, God. 2. The action or affection amiable, delight. 3. The object dreadfull, deprivation of life. 4. The subject guilty, the wicked. The words are uttered by a figurative interrogation, in which there is more evidence and efficacy, more life and convincing force. For it is as if he had said, Know ye not that I have no such desire? or thinke ye that I have any desire? or dare it enter into your thoughts, that I take any pleasure at all in the death of a sinner? When the interrogation is figurative, the rule is, that if the question be affirmative, the answer to it must be negative: but if the question be negative, the answer must be affirmative. For example: Who is like unto the Lord? the meaning is, none is like unto the Lord. Whom have I in heaven but thee? that is, I have none in heaven but thee. On the other side, when the question is negative, the answer must be affirmative: as, Are not the Angels ministring spirits? that is, the Angels are ministring spirits: and, Shall the Son of man find faith? that is, the Son of man shall not find faith. Here then apply the rule, and shape a negative answer to the first member being affirmative, thus: I have no desire that a sinner should dye; and an affirmative answer to the negative member, thus: I have a desire that the wicked should returne and live; and ye have the true meaning and naturall exposition of this verse. Have I any desire that the wicked should dye? 1. God is not said properly to have any thing: 2. if he may be said to have any thing, yet not desires: 3. if he may be said to have a desire of any thing, yet not of death: 4. if he desire the death of any, yet not of the wicked in his sinne. Have I? As the habits of the body are not the body, so neither the ha∣bits of the soule are the soule it selfe. Now whatsoever is in God is God: for he is a simple act, and his qualities or attributes are not re ipsâ distinct from his essence; and therefore he cannot be said properly to have any thing, but to be all things. Any desire. Desires, as Plato defineth them, are vela animi, the sailes of the mind, which move it no other wayes than the saile doth a ship. Desire of honour is the saile which moveth the ambitious: of pleasure is the saile which moveth the voluptuous: of gaine is the saile which moveth the covetous. Others define them spurres of the soule to prick us on forwards to such things as are most agreeable to our naturall inclination and delibe∣rate purposes. Hence it appeares, that properly there can be no desires in God, because desire is of something we want; but God wanteth nothing. Desires are meanes to stirre us up, but God is immoveable as he is immuta∣ble.
If then he be said to desire any thing, the speech is borrowed, and to be understood , in such sort as may agree with the nature of God; and it importeth no more than God liketh or approveth such things. That the wicked should dye. A sinner may be said to dye two manner of wayes; either as a sinner, or as a man: as a sinner he dyeth when his sinne dyeth in him, and he liveth: as a man he dyeth, either when his body is se∣vered from his soule, which is the first death; or when both body and soule are for ever severed from God, which is the second death. God desireth the death of a sinner in the first sense, but no way in the latter: he desireth that sinne should dye in us, but neither that we should dye the first death in sin, nor dye the second death for sinne. He is the author of life,Job 7.20. preserver of mankind. He is the1 Tim. 4.10. Saviour of all, especially them that beleeve. Hee would not that any should2 Pet. 3.9. perish, but all should come to repentance. If he should de∣sire the death of a sinner, as he should gain-say his owne word, so he should desire against his owne nature. For beeing is the nature of God, Sum qui sum, I am that I am, but death is the not beeing of the creature. No more than light can be the cause of darknesse, can God, who is life, be the cause of death. If he should desire the death of a sinner, he should destroy his principall attributes of wisedome, goodnesse, and mercy: Of wisdome; for what wisedome can it be to marre his chiefest worke? Of goodnesse; for how can it stand with goodnesse to desire that which is in it selfe evill? Of mercy; for how can it stand with mercy, to desire or take pleasure in the misery of his creature? Doth he desire the death of man, who gave man warning of it at the first, and meanes to escape it if he would: and after that by his voluntary transgression he was liable to the censure of death, provi∣ded him a Redeemer to ransome him from death; calleth all men by the Gospel to faith and repentance unto life, giveth charge to his Apostles and their successors to preach the Gospel unto every creature, saying:Mar. 16.16. Whoso∣ever beleeveth and is baptized, shall be saved? But here some cast a darke mist, which hath caused many to lose their way. How (say they) doe we maintaine that God desireth not the death of a sinner, who before all time decreed death for sinne, and sinne for death? This mist in part is dispelled by distinguishing of three sorts of Gods de∣crees: 1. There is an absolute decree and resolute purpose of God, for those things which he determineth shall be. 2. There is a decree of mandate, or at least a warrant for those things which he desireth should be. 3. There is a decree of permission for such things, as if he powerfully stop them not, will be. Of the first kind of decree or will of God, wee are to understand those words of the Psalmist, Quaecunque voluit, fecit Deus; WhatsoeverPsal. 135.6. God would, that hath he done: and of our Saviour, Father,John 17.24. & Rom. 9.19. Ephes. 1.5. 1 Tim. 2.4. I will that they also whom thou hast given mee be with mee where I am. To the second we are to referre those words of the Apostle, God would have all men to come to the knowledge of the truth, God would that all should come to2 Pet. 3.9. repentance: and, This is the will of God, even your1 Thes. 4.3. sanctification: and,Rom. 12.2. Be yee not confor∣med to this present world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,
that ye may prove what is the acceptable and perfectJohn 7.17. will of God. In the last acception the Apostle seemeth to take the word will in those words: It is better, if the1 Pet. 3.17. will of God bee so, that yee suffer for well doing than for e∣vill doing: and Saint Austine, where he maintaineth that even those things that are most repugnant to the Law of God, and so directly against his re∣vealed will, are not besides his will, but in some sort fall within the com∣passe of his decrees. TheEncharid ad Laurent. c. 100. Hoc ipso quod contra Dei vo∣luntatem fece∣runt de ipsis facta est volun∣tas ejus, & mi∣ro & inestabi∣le modo non fit praeter ejus voluntatem, quod etiam contra ejus vo∣luntatem fit, quia nec fieret, nisi sineret, nec utique nolens, sed volens, nec sineret bonus fieri male, nisi omnipotens etiam de malo facere posset benè. will of God is done by or upon them, who seeme to crosse his will, after a wonderfull and unspeakable manner; that comes not to passe but by Gods will (that is, his secret decree) which is done against his will, (that is, his command.) For it could not be if he suffered it not, neither doth he suffer it against his will, but with his will: neither would he who it good suffer evill to be, but that by his omnipotency he can draw good out of evill. The second distinction, which much cleereth the point in question, is of good things, which may be sorted thus: 1. Some are good formally, good in themselves, and by & for selves: as all divine graces, and the salvation of the elect. 2. Some things are good suppositively and consequently: as warre is good not simply, but when without it either the safety or the honour of the state cannot be preserved: in like manner execu∣tions are nor good simply, but upon presupposall of hainous crimes worthy of death in him that is executed especially for the terrour of others. No man will say that it is simply good to launce or cut off a joynt, yet is it good in case that otherwayes the sore can∣not, be healed, or the sound parts preserved from a gangrene. 3. Some things are good occasionally onely or by accident, from whom some good may come, or be made of them, or out of them: as treacle of poyson, and wholsome pills of such ingredi∣ents as are enemies to nature. If ye rightly apply these distinctions, ye may without great difficulty loosen the knots above tyed: the first whereof was, whether God decreed sinne originall or actuall. Ye may answer according to the former distincti∣ons, that he decreed effectually all the good that is joyned with it, or may come by it, or it may occasion: but hee decreed permissively onely theAl Monim. Malum prae∣scivit Deus, non praedesti∣navit. Anomy, obliquity, or malignity thereof: he neither doth it, nor appro∣veth of it when it is done, but only permitteth it, and taketh advantage of it for the manifestation of his justice. When Fulgentius denieth that God decreeth sinne, and theConcil. Araus. Ad malum di∣vinâ potestate praedestinatos non modo non dicimus, sed etiam siqui sint qui id af∣firmare ausint, cum summâ execratione in eos anathema dicimus. Arausican Councell thundereth out an anathema against any that dare maintaine such an impious assertion, they are to bee understood of a decree of effecting, or commanding, or warranting it. But when Calvin pleads hard for Adams fall to have not come to passe without a decree from God; lest he should make God an idle spectatour of an event of so great consequence, we are to interpret his words of a decree of per∣mission of the event, and disposing of the fall foreseen by him, to the grea∣ter manifestation of his justice and mercy. Ordinavit (saith Junius) id est, statuit ordinem rei, non rem ipsam decrevit. To the second question, which toucheth the apple of the eye of this Text, whether God decreeth the death of any? ye may answer briefly,
that he doth not decree it any way for it selfe, as it is the destruction of his creature, or a temporall or eternall torment thereof; but as it is a manifesta∣tion of his justice. Here I might take occasion (as many doe) to dispute divers intricate questions concerning the decrees of God, especially of reprobation, both absolute and comparative; and the acts of it, privative and positive: whether it depend meerly upon the will of God, or passe ex praevisis, or propter prae∣visa peccata, upon, or for sinnes fore-seen, originall or actuall: as also con∣cerning the object, whether it be homo condendus, conditus, integer, or lapsus, whether man considered in fieri, as clay or red earth in the hands of God, out of which some vessels were to be made to honour, some to dishonour; or as created of God according to his image before his fall, or as fallen in Adam, tainted with originall sinne: or lastly, singular persons considered in the state of infidelity or impenitency, and so dying; sedScotus in 1. sent. dist. 41. nolo scrutari pro∣fundum, ne eatur in profundum; I will not approach too neere this deep whirle-poole, lest with many through giddinesse of braine I fall into it. For although I have read what S. Austine writeth touching these points toEpist. 105 & lib. 1. ad simpl. q. 2. Sixtus, Prosper to Vincentius, Falgentius to Monimus, what the 4. Councels held at Arles, Arausica, Valentia, & Mentz decreed against or for Godescalcus, & whatAquin. 1. q. 22. art. 3. Aquinas, Bonaventure, Ariminensis, Basolis, Biel, Banes, Capreolus, and Mediovillanus, and the Dominicans resolve on the one side; and whatLoc supr. cit.

Scotus, Argentinensis, Herveus, Occham, Cumel, Molina,In 1. sent. dist. 41. and the Francis∣cans generally on the other side, and lastly what the Remonstrants & Con∣tra-remonstrants in our age have published one against the other to the worlds view: yet I professe I find many thorny difficulties, which cannot be plucked out but with that strong hand of the Apostle, ORom. 9.20, 21. man, who art thou that disputest with God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made mee thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessell unto honour, and another unto dishonour? When all mankind in Adam lay in the snares of death, in which they intangled themselves, to have left all in that woefull plight had been justice without mercy, to have plucked all out had been mercy without justice; but to draw out some, and leave others in that doome which all had deserved, declareth both the divine attributes of justice and mercy: justice eternally shining in the deserved flames of the damned, and mercy in the undeserved crownes of the elect. But why more are not ordained to be saved than to be dam∣ned; why of children yet unborne one should bee loved, and another hated; why the Infidels child sometimes comes to baptisme, and the seed of the faithfull dyeth without it; why Christ wrought not thoseMat. 11.20. miracles in Tyrus and Sidon, which he did in Capernaum, sith he knew they would have brought those Heathens to repentance in sackcloth and ashes, whereas they took no good effect with the Capernaits; why St.Act. 16.6, 7. Paul was forbid to preach in some places where they found no opposition in the people, and commanded to preach in other places where the people shewed themselvesAct. 13.46. unworthy the means of salvation; why it is given to some to know theMat. 11.25. & 13.11. my∣steries of Christs Kingdome, and they are hid from others; why God isRom. 10.20. found of some who seeke him not, and not found of others who seek him with teares; why some of most harmlesse and innocent carriage yet live and dye
in those places, where they never can heare of any tidings of the Gospel, others who have given scope to their vicious desires, and for many yeeres continued in a most abominable estate of life, defiling their mouthes with blasphemy, their hands with theft and murder, their whole body with un∣cleannesse, yet before their death have the Gospel preached unto them, and their hearts opened to give heed unto it, and they sealed to the day of redemp∣tion: I professe with SaintAmb. l. de vo∣cat. gent. c. 5. Cur illorum sit misertus non horum quae scientia potest compre∣hendere? libe∣ratur pars ho∣minum par∣te pereunte, & si hoc volunta∣tis meritis veli∣mus ascribere, resistet innu∣merabilium causa populo∣rum. Ambrose, Latet discretionis ratio, non latet ipsa discretio; this difference which God maketh of men is apparent, but the reason thereof is not apparent. I confesse with S.Qui in factis Dei rationem non invenit, in infirmitate suâ rationem inve∣nit quare rati∣onem non in∣veniat. Gregory, he that findeth not a reason of the actions of God, finds a reason in his owne infirmity why he cannot find it. I resolve with SaintAug. de verb. Dom. serm. 20. Quaeras tu rationem, ego expavescam altitudinem, tu ratiocinare, ego credam. Aug. ep. 105. ad Sixt.

Austine, Seeke thou a reason, I will tremble at the depth of Gods councels: dispute thou, I will beleeve: I see depth, I find no bottome. Doest thou, O man, looke for a reason of mee? I am a man as well as thou; therefore let us both give eare to him, who saith, O homo, O man, what art thou who standeth upon termes with thy Maker, and holdeth out argument against him? If ever that censure of the Poet fell justly upon any, NaeTerent. in Andria. intelligendo faciunt, ut nihil intelligant; they understand themselves out of their wits, it most deservedly lighteth on those in our age, who cast all Gods workes in the mould of their owne braine, and take upon them to yeeld a reason of his eternall counsels; as if they had been hisRom. 11.33, 34. counsellers, who search into the unsearchable judgements of God, and will seem to find those wayes which are past finding out.Rom. 11.33, 34. O the deph of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgements, and his wayes past finding out? Who hath knowne the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counseller? These men resemble those that unskilfully handle knots of wier strings, who by taking the wrong end, the more they labour to untwist them, the more they tangle them, and in the end are forced to cast them away as unserviceable for their instruments: wherefore leaving their curious speculations upon my Text, I come to a briefe application. 1. Doth God take no pleasure in the death of the wicked that daily trans∣gresse his Law, grievously provoke his wrath, ungraciously abuse his mercy, and sleightly regard his judgements? Doth hee use all good meanes to reclaime them, and save them from wrath to come? Is the life of every man so precious in his eyes? Doth he esteem of it as a rich jew∣ell engraven with his owne image? how carefull then and chary ought we to be, who are put in trust with it (locked up in the casket of our body) that we lose it not by carelesse negligence, much lesse expose it for a prey to o∣thers by duels, either sending or accepting challenges? Doe we set such an invaluable jewell, as is the life of our bodies and soules, at so low a rate, that we will put it to the hazzard, as it were to the cast of a Die for a matter of naught, a toy, a trifle, a jussle, a taking of the wall, an affront, a word? Doe wee make so small reckoning of that which cost our Saviour his dearest hearts bloud? 2. If Judges, & all those who sit upon life and death did enter into a seri∣ous consideration thereof, they would not so easily (as sometimes they doe) cast away a thing that is so precious, much lesse receive the price of bloud. For if it be accounted, and that deservedly, a sinne of a deep die, to buy and sell things dedicated to the service of God, what punishment doe
they deserve, who buy and sell the living image of God? It is reported of Augustus, that he never pronounced a capitall sentence without fetching a deep sigh; and of Titus the Emperour, that hee willingly accepted of the Priests office, that hee might never have his hand dipped in bloud; and of Nero, that when he was to set his hand to a capitall sentence, he wished that he could not write, Utinam literas nescirem: therefore let those Judges think what answer they will make at Christs Tribunall, who are so farre from Christian compassion, and hearts griefe, and sorrow, when they are forced to cut off a member of Christ by the sword of justice, that they sport themselves, and breake jests, and most inhumanely insult upon the poore prisoner, whose necke lyeth at the stake. If any sinne against our neighbour leave a deep staine in our conscience, it is the bloudy sinne of cruelty. Other sinnes may be hushed in the conscience, and rocked asleep with a song of Gods mercy; but this is reckoned in holy Scripture among thoseGen. 4.10. crying sins, that never will be quiet till they have awaked Gods revenging justice. This is a crimson sinne, and I pray God it cleave not to their consciences, who wear the scarlet robe. If there be any such Judges, I leave them to their Judge, and briefly come to you, Right Honourable, &c. with the short exhorta∣tion of the Apostle,  Put you on theColos. 3.12. bowells of mercy and compassion; and if ever the life of your brethren be in your hands, make speciall reckoning of it, in no wise rashly cast it away: let it not goe out of your hands, unlesse the law and justice violently wrest and extort it from you. Assure your selves, that it is a farre more honourable thing, and will gaine you greater love and favour with God, and reputation with men, toCicer. pro Quint. de A∣quil. Mavult commemorare se cùm perdere potuerat pe∣percisse, quàm cùm parcere potuerat perdi∣disse. save a man whom yee might have cast away, than to cast him away under any pretence whom yee might have saved. 4. If a malefactour arraigned at the barre of justice, should perceive by any speech, gesture, signe, or token, an inclination in the Judge to mercy, how would he worke upon this advantage? what suit? what meanes would he make for his life? how would he importune all his friends to intreat for him? how would he fall down upon his knees & beseech the Judge for the mercies of God to be good unto him? Hoe all ye that have guilty consci∣ences, and are privie to your selves of many capitall crimes, though perad∣venture no other can appeach you, behold, the Judge of all flesh makes an overture of mercy, he bewrayeth more than a propension or inclination, he discovereth a desire to save you, why doe ye not make meanes unto him? why do ye not appeale from the barre of his justice to his throne of grace? why doe ye not flye from him as he is a terrible Judge, to him as he is a mercifull Father? Though by nature ye are the sonnes of wrath, yet by grace ye are the adopted sonnes of the Father of mercy, and God of all conso∣lation, who stretcheth out his armes all the day long unto us. Let us turne to him, yea though it be at the last houre of our death, and he will turne to us: let us repent us of our sinnes, and he will repent him of his judgements: let us retract our errours, and he will reverse his sentence: let us wash a∣way our sinnes with our teares, and he will blot out our sentence with his Sonnes bloud. WhenDan. 5.5. Belshazzar saw the hand-writing against him on the wall, his heart mis-gave him, all his joynts trembled, and his knees smote one against the other. Beloved Christians, there is aColos. 2.14. hand-writing of ordinances
against us all, and if we see or minde it not, it writeth more terrible things against us. What shall wee doe to be rid of this feare? Is there any means under heaven to take out the writing of God against us? Yes beloved, teares of repentance with faith in Christs blood maketh that aqua fortis that will fetch out even the hand-writing of God against us. The Prophet recordeth it for a miraculous accident, that the sun went back many degrees in the Dyall ofEsa. 38.8. Ahaz. Beloved, our fervent prayers and penitent tears will work a greater miracle than this, they will bring back again theMal. 4.2. Sun of righteousnesse, after he is set in our soules. God cannot sin, Angels cannot repent, onely man that sinneth is capable of repentance; and shall wee not embrace that vertue which is onely ours? Other vertues are remedies against speciall maladies of the soule: as humility against pride, hope against despaire, courage a∣gainst feare, chastity against lust, meeknesse against wrath, faith against dif∣fidence, charity against covetousnesse; but repentance is a soveraigne reme∣dy against all the maladies of the minde. Other vertues have their seasons: as patience in adversity, temperance in prosperity, almes-deeds when our brothers necessity calleth upon our charity, fasting when wee afflict our soules in time of plague, or any other judgement of God; but repentance is alwayes in season, either for our grosser sinnes, or for failing in our best acti∣ons: if for no other cause, yet wee are to repent for the insincerity and im∣perfection of our repentance. I will end this my exhortation as the Pro∣phet doth this chapter,Ezek. 18.30.31. Repent and turne your selves from all your transgres∣sions, so iniquity shall not bee your ruine. Cast away all your transgressions whereby yee have transgressed, and make you new hearts and new spirits, for why will yee die O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord God? wherefore turne your selves and live yee. O Lord, who desirest not that wee should die in our sinnes, but our sinnes in us, mortifie our fleshly members by the power of thy Sonnes death, and renew us in the spirit of our mindes by the vertue of his resurrection, that wee may die daily to the world, but live to hea∣ven; die to sinne, but live to righteousnesse; die to our selves, but live to thee. Thou by the Prophet professest thy desire of our conversion, say but the word and wee shall bee converted: call us by thy spirit and wee shall heare thee, and hearing thee turne from our wicked wayes, and tur∣ning live a new life of grace here, and an eternall life of glory hereafter in heaven, with thee O Father the infuser, O Son the purchaser, O holy Spirit the preserver of this life.

THE BEST RETURNE. THE LV. SERMON. EZEK. 18.23. Not that hee should returne from his wayes and live? Or, if hee returne from his evill wayes shall hee not live? Right Honourable, &c. SAintPossid. in vit. Austine lying on his death-bed caused divers verses of the penitentiall Psalmes to bee written on the walls of his chamber, on which he still cast his eyes, and com∣mented upon them with the fluent Rhetoricke of his tears. But I could wish of all texts of Scripture that this of the Prophet Ezekiel were still before all their eyes who mourn for their sins in private. For nothing can raise the dejected soule but the lifting up of Gods counte∣nance upon her; nothing can dry her tears, but the beams of his favour brea∣king out of the darke clouds of his wrath, and shining upon her: nothing can bring peace to an affrighted and troubled conscience but a free pardon of all sinnes, whereby shee hath incurred the sentence of death; which the Prophet tendereth in the words of the text. Which are as the very heart of this chapter, and every word thereof may serve as a principall veine to con∣veigh life-blood to all the languishing, or benummed and deaded members of Christ his mysticall body. Returne and live. These words are spirit and life, able to raise a sinner from the grave, and set him on his feet, to tread firmly upon the ground of Gods mercy: as also to put strength and vigour into his feeble and heavie limbes; 1. to creep, then to walke, and last of all to runne in the pathes of Gods commandements. The explication whereof to our understanding, and application to our wils and affections, were the limits of my last Lords-dayes journey. By the light which was then given
you, yee might easily discerne our lusts (which are sudden motions) from Gods desires, which are eternall purposes: and distinguish betweene a sin∣ner who is not purged from all dregges of corruption, and a wicked person who Moab-like is settled upon his lees; between a common infirmity, and a dangerous sickenesse; betweene sin in the act, and wickednesse in the habit. Questionlesse there is more reason to pitty him that falleth or slippeth, than him that leapeth into the sink of sinne, and daily walloweth in the mire of sensuall pleasures. Yet such is the mercy and goodnesse of almighty God, that hee desireth not that the wicked, such as make a trade of sinne, and have a stiffe necke, a hard heart, a seared conscience, that the wretchedst mis∣creants that breathe should either dye in their sinnes here, or for their sinnes hereafter. The former of the two is the death of life, the latter wee may significantly tearme the life of death, which exerciseth the damned with most unsufferable pangs and torments for evermore. Here when wee part life dyeth, but in hell death liveth, and the terrours and pangs thereof are renewed and encreased daily; the former death is given to the vessells of wrath for their earnest, the latter is paid them for their wages. This death is properly the wages of sinne, which God cannot in justice with-hold from the servants of sinne, and vassals of Satan. For God, whose infinite wisdom comprehends not only the necessity of all effects in their determined, but also the possibility in their supposed causes; foreseeing from all eternity what an intelligent nature, endued with free∣will, left to himselfe, would doe; how hee would fall, and wound himselfe by his fall; and knowing how hee could so dispose of his fall, and cure his wound, that his (the Creators) glory might bee no whit impaired, but ra∣ther encreased by not powerfully hindering it; decreed to create this crea∣ture for his glory: which he appointed to shew upon him by three meanes. 1. By way of generall bounty, in placing the first parents of mankinde in Paradise, and in them giving all sufficient meanes to bring them to eternall happinesse; an end infinitely elevated above the pitch of their owne nature: and after the abuse of their free-will, and losse of that happy estate in which they were created, and bringing themselves into thraldome to sinne and Satan. 2. By way of speciall mercy, graciously freeing, freely justifying, justly glorifying someRom. 9.23. in and by Christ, viz. the vessels of mercy prepared unto glory. 3. By way of justice, in utterly leaving, or uneffectually cal∣ling, and upon abuse or refusall of some measure of grace offered to them, deservedly hardening, and upon their finall incredulity and impenitency ne∣cessarily condemning, and in the end eternally punishing others, to wit, the vessels of wrath, , made up, or fitted to destruction. This fabricke of celestiall doctrine, strongly built upon evident texts of Scrip∣tures, may serve for a fortresse to defend this text, and the principall do∣ctrines contained in it, against all the batteries of Heretickes and Atheists made against it. viz. 1. That God approveth not the death of the wicked in his sinne, but on the contrary, liketh, and commandeth, and taketh pleasure in his con∣version. 2. That he decreeth not, or desireth the death of any wicked for it selfe, as it is the misery and destruction of his creature; but as a manifestation of
his justice. For heLam. 3.33. punisheth not  with his heart, or willingly: hee made not death, nor delighteth in theWisd. 1.13. Fulgent. ad Mon. Mortem morienti non fecit, qui mor∣tem mortuo justè retribuit. destruction of the living. Thy destruction is from thy selfe,Hos. 13.9. O Israel, but in mee is thy helpe. The wicked after his hard∣nesse and impenitent heart, treasureth up unto himselfe wrath against the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgement of God: who rendreth to e∣very man according to his workes. Upon which texts the Fathers inferre, that not onely the execution, but the very decree of damnation of the repro∣bate passeth upon their sinne foreseene. SaintEp. ad Sixt. Vasa irae ho∣mines sunt propter naturae bonu n creati, propter vitia spplicio desti∣nati; & si vasa sint perfecta in perditionem, sibi hoc impu∣tent. Austine, The vessels of wrath are wicked men created for the good of nature, but destinated to punishment for their sinnes: And againe, If they are fitted to destruction let them thanke themselves. SaintProsper ad object. 3. Gal. Qui à sancti∣tate vitae per immunditiem labuntur, non ex eo necessita∣tem pereundi habuerunt, qui∣a praedestinati non sunt, sed quia tales fu∣turi ex volun∣tariâ praevari∣catione praesci∣ti sunt. Prosper: They that fall away from holinesse through un∣cleanness, lye not under a necessity of perishing because they were not predestina∣ted: but therefore were not predestinated, because they were foreknowne that they would be such by voluntary prevarication.Fulgent. l. 1. ad Mon. Ini∣quos quos prae∣scivit Deus hanc vitam in peccato termi∣naturos, decre∣vit supplicio interminabili puniendos; & illos ad suppli∣cium praedesti∣navit, quos à se praescivit vitio malae volunta∣tis discessuros, & peccata ho∣minum Deus praescivit, quib sententiā prae∣destinatione di∣ctavit. Fulgentius: Those unjust men whom God foresaw that they would end their life in sin, hee decreed to punish in endlesse torments: And againe, hee predestinated them to punishment who he foresaw would depart from him by the fault of their evill will: And againe, God foresaw the sinnes of men, against which hee pronounced a sentence in his de∣cree of predestination. And the Fathers in the Synode held atValent. can. 2. Nec ipsos ma∣los ideò perire, quia boni esse non potuerunt, sed quia boni esse noluerunt; suo{que} vitio in massâ damnationis, vel merito originali, vel etiam actuali permanserunt. Valentia: The wicked perish not because they could not, but because they would not bee good, remaining in the masse of corruption by their owne fault, originall or al∣so actuall: As likewise in theConcil. Arelat. 3. Lucidi habetur confessio his verbis: Profiteor aeternales flammas factis capitalibus praeparatas. Synod at Arles. 3. That hee no way desireth, nor decreeth, nor so much as permitteth the death of any of his Elect; though before their calling to the knowledge of the truth, and sometimes after also, they so grievously transgresse his ho∣ly lawes, that they may bee numbred, at least for the time, among the wic∣ked. For how farre soever they goe in the wayes of wickednesse, they will turne at the last; and if a sinner turne from his wayes even at the brinke of destruction and gate of hell, hee shall live: for, Have I any desire at all that the wicked should die, saith the Lord God, and not that hee should Returne? There are many turnings in the life of a Christian: The first turning or conversion is by a sanctified phrase called regeneration, where∣by wee are mortified in the flesh, but renewed in the spirit of our minde; wee cast off the old man, and put on the new. All after conversions are but so many par∣ticular acts of repentance, and returnes from those courses which wee ordi∣narily fall into, and follow, if Gods preventing grace stop not the motions of our corrupt nature. This first conversion is as it were a generall purgation of all the peccant humors of our soul, & is of that force that it changeth and altereth our temper and complexion. After this, all other aversions from sinne and returnes to God, are but like speciall purgations, prescribed by the Physitian of our soules, to bee taken upon speciall occasion, for the cu∣ring of some particular malady. In the first, non agimus, sed agimur; wee worke not, but are wrought upon, being, as the reformed Divines speake, meer passive: in the other, acti agimus, being wrought upon wee worke, like the wheeles in the vision of Ezekiel, being moved by the spirit we move to God∣ward. At our first conversion the Scripture compareth us to dead men, that
are not able to stirre any joint; but in all later conversions, after God hat breathed into us the spirit of regeneration, to sicke or weake men lying up∣on their bed, that are able to turne themselves with some helpe. This di∣stinction of conversions is not new coyned by us, but beareth the stampe of ancient truth, and is current in the Scriptures: in which wheresoever the faithfull speake thus to God, Turne us and wee shall bee turned, they aime at the first conversion; but where God thus speaketh to his people, Turne yee unto mee, or, turne from your wicked wayes, we are to understand such texts of later conversions. From his wayes. Not from the wayes of God, and pathes of righteous∣nesse, but his owne wayes, that is, such courses as hee hath taken beside, and against the direction of Gods Spirit. More particularly thus; Have I not a desire that the ambitious should leave his inordinate pursuit of honour, the covetous of gaine, the voluptuous of pleasure, and all of vanity, and that they should turne to mee with their whole heart, with a perfect hatred of their former wickednesse, and full and constant purpose of amendment, and so Live? That is, escape eternall death, the due wages of sinne, and attaine everlasting life, the undue reward of righteousnesse. If the feare of hellish torments cannot make a separation betweene us and our beloved sinnes: nor hope of heavenly joyes winne us unto God, it will bee to small purpose to goe about to scare any with temporall plagues threatened in Gods law a∣gainst sinne, or pricke them with the sting of conscience, or confound them with shame, or amplifie upon the losses of spirituall graces, which can ne∣ver bee recovered but by speedy and hearty repentance. The Spye of na∣ture, in his booke of the length and shortnesse of life, demonstrateth natu∣rall heat and radicall moisture to bee the sole preservers and maintainers of life, and the store of both in due proportion to bee the cause of longer life. As life is compared in Scripture, so it is resembled in sculpture to a light or lampe burning; the fire which kindleth the flame of this lampe is naturall heat, and the oyle which feedeth it is radicall moisture: without flame there is no light, without oyle to maintaine it, no flame: in like manner if either naturall heat, or radicall moisture faile, life cannot last: and as in a lampe, if by reason of the thicknesse of the weeke the flame be too great, it oversoon sucketh up the oyle; if the oyle be poured in in too great abundance, it choa∣keth the light: so in us, if naturall heat or radicall moisture exceed measure or proportion, the lampe of our life burneth dimly, and in a short space is ex∣tinguished. Answerable to the naturall life in the body is the spirituall life of grace in the soule: for as that is preserved calido & humido, by heat and moisture; so is this also by the heat of love, or zeale of devotion, and the moi∣sture of penitent teares. Teares are the oyle which feed this flame: for when wee pricke deepe the tenderest veines in our heart with remembrance of our manifold and grievous transgressions, whereby wee have dishonoured God our Father, displeased Christ our Redeemer, and grieved the Spirit of grace our Comforter: when wee take kindly to heart how that the better God hath beene unto us, the worse wee have proved unto him; the more grace hath abounded, the more sinne hath super abounded; when our hearts melt with these considerations, and our eyes resolve into showres of teares;
then we perceive that as salt water cast into fire increaseth the heat, so the salt water of our teares inflameth our devotion, kindleth our zeale, and quickeneth all our spirituall exercises of piety. To nourish and maintaine this oyle, that our lamp goe not out, I will endeavour to open two springs in my Text; the one a higher, the other a lower: the one ariseth from God and his joy, the other from our selves and our salvation. That the conversion of a sinner is a joy and delight to God, I need not to produce arguments to prove, or similes to illustrate; he that spake as never man spake, hath represented it unto us by many exquisite emblemes: TheLuke 15.4, 8, 10, 32. joy of a woman for her lost groat found, of a shepheard for his wandering sheep recovered, of a father for his prodigall child returned and re∣claimed. SaintL. 8. confes. c. 3. Quantò majus pericu∣lum fuit in proelio, tantò majus gaudium in triumpho. Austine yeeldeth a reason hereof, The more danger there is in the conflict with temptation, the greater joy in the triumph. Such was the joy of the Church forCyp. de lapsis. Fortiores igni∣bus facti, qui anteà ignibus cesserunt; & unde superati, inde supera∣runt. Castus and Aemilius, who though at the first upon the sight of fire prepared for them, they gave backe, and were at a kind of stand, yet afterwards, beyond all hope and expectation, made a noble pro∣fession of their faith, and gloriously endured the fiery tryall. To whom did our Saviour ever more honour, than to Zacheus the converted Publicane, to whose house he came being not invited, and brought with him the glad∣dest tidings that ever were heard there, ThisLuke 19.9. day salvation is come to this house: and to Mary Magdalen, out of whom he cast sevenMat. 26.13. Divels, to whom he first appeared after his resurrection, whose spikenard he mingled with the ointment of the Gospel, in such sort that whosoever smelleth the savour of life, hath a sent also of the boxe of sweet perfume which she brake upon our Saviours head? Scipio (as Livie writeth) never looked so fresh, nor seemed so beautifull in the eyes of his souldiers, as after his recovery from a dangerous sicknesse which he tooke in the camp: neither doth the soule ever seem more beautifull, than when she is restored to health after some dangerous malady. The Palladium was in highest esteem both with the Trojans and Romanes, not so much for the matter or workmanship, as be∣cause it was catched out of the fire when Troy was burnt. And certainly no soule is more precious in the eyes of God and his Angels, than that which is snatched out of the fire of hell and jawes of death. As the woman in the Gospel more rejoyced for her lost groat after she found it, than for all the groats she had safe in her chest: and as the shepheard tooke more delight in his lost sheepe after, he found it, than in the rest which never wan∣dered; so saith our blessed Saviour,Luke 15.7. There shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance. I have opened the first spring, and we have tasted the waters thereof: I am now to open the second, which is this, That as our repentance is joy unto God and his Angels, so it is grace and salvation to our selves. As repentance is calledHeb. 6.1. repentance from dead workes, so alsoActs 11.18. repentance unto life. For God pawnes his life for the life of the penitent: As I live, saith the Lord, I desire not the death of a sinner, but rather that hee should returne and live.Plin. l. 2. c. 103 In Dodone Jo∣vis fons, cum sit gelidus, si extinctae faces admoveantur, extinguit. Causs. in Parab. hist. l. 10. In Epiro esse fe∣runt fontem, in quo faces accenduntur extinctae. Pliny writeth of a fountaine in Africa, in which torches that are blowne out being dipped are kindled againe: such is the fountaine of teares in the eyes of a penitent sinner; if the light of his faith be extingui∣shed
to his sense and all outward appearance, yet dipped in this fountaine, it is kindled againe, and burnes more brightly than ever before. The Scrip∣ture furnisheth us not with many examples in this kind, lest any should presume; yet some we find that none might despaire. A man could hardly runne a more wicked race than the theefe upon the Crosse, who lived both in caede and ex caede, maintaining his riot and wantonnesse by rob∣bery and murder; yet hee holdeth on his course even to the goale, and there taketh a greater booty than ever before: for hee stealeth a celestiall Crowne. And behold this theefe nailed hand and foot to the Crosse, yet comming to our Saviour by faith, and embracing him by love, and re∣ceiving from him, together with a discharge from the prison of hell, a faire grant of Paradise,Luke 23.43. This day shalt thou be with mee in Paradise. It should seem they were ill imployed either all or the greatest part of that day, who came in but at the last houre into the Lords Vineyard, yet they who came in then, received their full hire. The Divell occupied a large roome in Martes heart, and found there good entertainment, else hee would have never taken sixe other inmates with him to dwell and lodge there; yet Christ cast allMarke 16.9. seven out of her, and a whole legion out ofMarke. 5.9. another: and though this were a great miracle, yet to cheare up the drooping lookes, nd comfort the fainting spirits, and strengthen the feeble knees of all hat bow to hm for pardon and forgivenesse, he wrought farre greater. For he raised three dead men; the firstMat. 9.25. newly departed: the secondLuke 7.12. brought out, and lying upon the beere: the thirdJohn 11.44. buried, and stinking in his grave. A man may be ill a long time before he take his bed, and lye long in his bed before hee feele the pangs of death, and be long dead before hee be bu∣ried, and a good while buried before he putrifie: yet to shew that no time prescribeth against Gods mercy, nor excludeth our repentance from dead workes, Christ by miracle raised two that were dead, and a third stinking in his grave. To comfort those that are wounded in conscience, the goodLuke 10.30. Samaritan cured him that was wounded between Jerusalem and Jericho, and left halfe dead: to comfort them that are sicke in soule, hee recoveredMat. 8.14. Peters wives mother lying sicke in her bed: to comfort them that have newly as it were given up the ghost, hee raised Jairus daugh∣ter: to comfort them that have been sometimes dead in sinnes and trans∣gressions, he raised the widowes sonne: to comfort them that have been so long dead in sinnes that they begin to putrifie, hee raised up Lazarus stinking in his grave. God forbid that any one Divell should get possessi∣on of our hearts, yet seven, nay a legion may be cast out by fasting and prayer. God forbid that any of us should be long sicke of any spirituall disease, yet those that have been sicke unto death have been restored; yea those that have been long dead have been raised. God forbid that wee should forsake our heavenly Fathers house, and in a strange countrey waste his goods, and consume our portion; yet after we have run riot, and spent all the gifts of nature, and goods of this life, and lavished out our time the most precious treasure of all, yet in the end if we come to our selves, and looke homewards, our heavenly Father will meet us, and kill the fat calfe for u. Therefore if wee have grievously provoked Gods justice by pre∣sumption, let us not more wrong his mercy by despaire; but hope even
above hope in him, whose mercy is over all his workes. Against the num∣ber and weight of all our sinnes, let us lay the infinitenesse of Gods mercy, and Christ his merits, and the certainty of his promise confirmed by oath: As I live, I desire not the death of a sinner; if hee returne, he shall live. Oh (saith SaintBern. in Cant. Quis dabit ca∣piti meo aquam & oculis meis fontem lachry∣marum, ut praeveniam fle∣tibus fletum & stridorem den∣tium? Bernard) that mine eyes were springs of teares, that by my wee∣ping here I might prevent everlasting weeping and gnashing of teeth in hell. What pitie is it that we should fret and grieve, and disquiet our selves and others for the losse of a Jewell from our eare, or a ring from our finger, and should take no thought at all for the losse of the Jewels of Gods grace out of our soules? We are overwhelmed as it were in a deluge of teares at the death of our friends, who yet are alive to God, though dead to this world: but have we not a thousand times greater reason to open those floodgates of salt waters which nature hath set in our eyes, for our selves, who are dead to God, though alive to the world? St.De laps. Si quem de tu∣is chatis mor∣talitatis exitu perdidisses, in∣gemisceres do∣lenter, & fleres, facie incultâ, veste mutatâ, neglecto capil∣lo, vultu nubi∣lo, ore dejecto, indicia moero∣ris ostenderes; animam tuam miser perdidi∣sti, spiritualitèr mortuus es, su∣pervivere hic tibi, & ipse am∣bulans funus tuum portare caepisti, & non acritèr plangis, non ugitèr in∣gemiscis. Cyprian hath a sweet touch on this string; If any of thy deare friends were taken away from thee by death, thou wouldst sigh, thou wouldst sob, thou wouldst put on blacks, thou wouldst hang done thy head, thou wouldst dis-figure thy face, thou wouldst let thy haire hang carelesly about thine eares, thou wouldst wring thy hands, thou wouldst knock thy breast, thou wouldst throw thy selfe downe upon the ground, thou wouldst expresse sorrow in all her gestures and postures: O wretched man that thou art, thou hast lost thy soule, thou art spiritually dead, thou survivest thy selfe, and carriest a dead corps about thee, and dost thou not take on? dost thou not fetch a deepe sigh? hast thou not a compassionate teare for thy selfe? wilt thou not be thy owne mourner? especially considering that all thy weeping and howling for thy friend cannot fetch him backe againe, or restore him to life; whereas thy weeping for thy selfe in this vale of tears, and seriously bewailing thy sinnes, may and by Gods grace shall revive thy soule, and recover all thy spirituall losses, and that with advantage. Expe∣rience teacheth us that the presentest remedie for a man that is stung in any part of his body by a Scorpion, is to take the oile of Scorpions, and therewith oft to annoint the place: sinne is the Scorpion that stingeth our soules even to death, if we apply nothing to it; yet out of this Scorpion sinne it selfe, and the sorrow for it, an oile or water may be drawne of pe∣nitent teares, wherewith if we annoint or wash our soules, we shall kill the venome of sinne, and allay the swelling of our conscience.Pind. od. 1. , It is a most soveraigne water which will fetch a sinner againe to the life of grace, though never so farre gone. It is not Well water springing out of the bowels of the earth, nor raine powred out of the clouds of passion, but rather like aCyp de card. Chris. op.

Have not I a desire that the wicked should turne from his wayes and live? When a subject hath rebelled against his naturall Soveraigne, or a servant grievously provoked his master, or a sonne behaved himselfe ungraciously towards his father, will the Prince sue to his subject, or a master to his ser∣vant, or a father to his sonne for a reconciliation? Will not an equall that hath a quarrell with his equall hold it a great disgrace and disparagement
to make any meanes that the quarrell may be taken up? will he not keepe out at full distance, and looke that the partie, who (as he conceiveth) hath wronged him, should make first towards him, and seeke to him? Yet such an affection God beareth to us, that though we (silly wormes of the earth) swell and rise against him, yet he seeketh to us, he sendeth Embassadours to2 Cor. 5.19, 20. treat of peace, and intreate and beseech us to be reconciled unto God. For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himselfe, not imputing their tres∣passes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are Embassadours for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christs stead, be reconciled unto God. Stand not out, my deare brethren, resigne the strong holds of your carnall imaginations and affecti∣ons, deliver up your members, that they may serve as weapons of righte∣ousnesse, and yeeld your selves to his mercy, and yee shall live. Turne and live. Should a prisoner led to execution heare the Judge or Sheriffe call to him, and say, Turne backe, put in sureties for thy good be∣haviour hereafter, and live; would he not suddenly leap out of his fetters, embrace the condition, and thanke the Judge or Sheriffe upon his knees? And what think ye if God should send a Prophet to preach a Sermon of re∣pentance to the divels and damned ghosts in hell, and say, Knock off your bolts, shake off your fetters, and turne to the Lord and live? would not hell be emptied and rid before the Prophet should have made an end of his ex∣hortation? This Sermon the Prophet Ezechiel now maketh unto us all here present,Ezek. 33.11. & 18.30.31. As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the wic∣ked, but that he turne from his wayes and live: turne ye, turne ye from your evill wayes, for why will yee die? Repent, and turne your selves from all your transgressions: so iniquity shall not bee your destruction. Cast away all your transgressions, whereby yee have transgressed, and make you a new heart, and a new spirit: for why will ye perish? Shake off the shackles of your sinnes, and quit the companie of the prisoners of death, and gally-slaves of Satan, put in sureties for your good behaviour hereafter, turne to the Lord your God with all your heart, and live, yea live gloriously, live happily, live eternally: which the Father of mercy grant for the me∣rits of his Sonne, through the grace of the Spirit. To whom, three persons and one God, be ascribed all honour, glorie, praise, and thankes now and for ever. Amen.
THE DANGER OF RELAPSE. THE LVI SERMON. EZEK. 18.24. But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousnesse, and commit∣teth iniquity, and doth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth shall hee live? All his righteousnesse that hee hath done shall not bee mentioned: in his trespasse that hee hath trespassed, and in his sin that hee hath sinned, in them shall hee dye. Right Honourable, &c. SAint Jerome maketh a profitable use of theGen. 28.12. And hee drea∣med, & behold a ladder set upon the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the An∣gels of God as∣cending and de∣scending on it. Angels ascen∣ding and descending upon the ladder which Jacob saw in a dreame, reaching from the earth to heaven. The lad∣der hee will have to bee the whole frame of a godly life, set upwards towards heaven, whereupon the children of God, who continually aspire to their inheritance that is above, arise from the ground of humility, and climbe by divine vertues, as it were so many rounds one above another, till Christ take them by the hand of their faith, and receive them into heaven. They are stiled Angels in regard of theirPhil. 3.20. heavenly conversation: these Jacob saw continually as∣cending and descending upon that ladder, viz. ascending by the motions of the spirit, but descending through the weight of the flesh; rising by the strength of grace, but falling through the infirmity of nature: and hereby (saith that learned Father)Hieron. ep. 11. Videbat sca∣lam per quam ascendebant Angeli, & de∣scendebant, ut nec peccator desperet salu∣tem, nec justus de suâ virtute securus sit. wee are lessoned not to despaire of grace, because Jacob saw Angels ascending; as they fell so they rose: nor yet presume of their owne strength, for hee saw Angels descending also; as they rose so they fell. Presumption and desperation are two dangerous maladies, not more opposite one to the other, than to the health of the soule: presumption o∣verpriseth Gods mercy, and undervalueth our sinnes: and on the contra¦rie
desperation overpriseth our sinnes, and undervalueth Gods mercy: both are most injurious to God; the one derogateth from his mercy, the other from his justice, both band against hearty and speedy repentance; the one opposing it as needlesse, the other as bootlesse: presumption saith thou maist repent at leasure, gather the buds of sinfull pleasures before they wither, repentance is not yet seasonable: desperation saith, the root of faith is wi∣thered, it is now too late to repent. The learned dispute whether of these two be the more pernicious and dangerous; the answer is easie, presumpti∣on is the more epidemicall, desperation, the more mortall disease. Presumpti∣on, like the Adder, stingeth more; but desperation, like the Basiliske, stings more deadly: many meet with Adders, which are almost found in all parts of the world; but few with Basiliskes. Presumption is more dan∣gerous extensivè, for it carrieth more to hell: but desperation inten∣sivè, for those whom it seizeth upon it carrieth more forcibly and altoge∣ther irrecoverably thither: and finall desperation never bringeth men to presumption, but presumption bringeth men often to finall desperation. To meete with these most pernicious evils, God hath given us both the Law and the Gospel; the Law to keepe us under in feare, that wee rise not proudly and presumptuously against him; and the Gospel to raise us up in hope that the weight of our sinnes sinke us not in despaire: the threats of the one serve to draw and asswage the tumour of pride; the promises of the o∣ther, to heale the sores of wounded consciences: and the Scripture (as Saint Basil rightly calleth it) is , a common Apothecaries shop, or physicke schoole, wherein are remedies for all the diseases of the soule. In these verses, as in two boxes there are soveraigne recipes against both the maladies above named: against the former, to wit, desperation, vers. 23. a∣gainst the later, viz. presumption, v. 24. And it is not unworthy your ob∣servation, that as in the beginning of the Spring when Serpents breed and peepeAdrianus Chamierus in ep. dedicat. Ec∣cles. Gal. Pastor. Sicut ineunte vere cùm pri∣mùm è terrae cuniculis pro∣deunt serpentes ad nocendum parati, fraxi∣num adversus venenatos eo∣rum morsus praesens reme∣dium laturam educit. out of their holes, the Ash puts forth, which is a present remedie against their stings and teeth: so the holy Ghost in Scripture for the most part delive∣reth an antidote in, or hard by those texts, from whence libertines and car∣nall men sucke the poyson of presumption. The texts are these: God hath rai∣sed up an horne of salvation for us, that we beeing delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might serve him without feare.Rom. 5.20. Where sinne abounded grace did much more abound.Rom. 8.1. There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.Gal. 5.13. We are called to liberty. Now see an antidote in the verses following. Lest any man should suck poyson from these words in the first text, Serve him without feare; it is added in the next words, in holinesse and righteous∣nesse before him all the dayes of our life. Lest any man should abuse the se∣cond, the Apostle within a verse putteth in a caveat, What shall we say then? shall we continue in sinne that grace may abound?Luk. 1.69, 72, 74. God forbid: how shall wee that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? vers. 1, 2. Lest any should gather too farre upon that generall speech of the Apostle, There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus,Luk. 1.75. there followes a restriction in the same verse, who walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit. Lest any should stumble at those words of the same Apostle, Ye are called to libertie, he reacheth them a hand, and giveth them a stay in the next clause; onely use not liberty for an occasion unto the flesh. Lest any presumptuous sinner should lay hold on the
hornes of the Altar, and claspe about that gracious promise,Tit. 2.11. The grace of God that bringeth salvation unto all men hath appeared, he beateth off their fingers in the next verse: teaching us, that denying ungodlinesse, and worldly lusts, wee should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this pre∣sent world. In like manner, lest any should2 Pet. 3.16. wrest the former verse of this Prophet, as they doe the other Scriptures, to the building forts of pre∣sumption, but to the apparent ruine of their owne soules, the Prophet for∣cibly withstandeth them in the words of my text, But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousnesse, &c. The life of a Christian is not unfit∣ly compared to a long and dangerous sea voyage; the sea is this present world, the barkes are our bodies, the sailers our soules, the pylot our faith, the card Gods Word, the rudder constancie, the anker hope, the maine mast the crosse of Christ, the strong cables our violent affections, the sailes our desires, and the holy Spirit the good winde which filleth the sailes and driveth the barke and marriners to the faireAct. 27.8. haven which is hea∣ven. Now in our way which lyeth through many temptations and tri∣bulations, there are two dangerous rockes, the one on the right hand, the other on the left; the rock on the right hand to be avoided is presumption, the rock on the left threatning shipwracke is despaire; betweene which we are to steere our ship by feare on the one side and hope on the other. To hold us in a solicitous feare that we touch not upon presumption, let us have alwayes in the eye of our minde, 1 The glorious and most omnipotent majesty of God. 2 His all-seeing providence. 3 His impartiall justice. 4 His severe threatnings against sinne. 5 The dreadfull punishments hee inflicteth upon sinners. 6 The heinousnesse of the sin of presumption, which turneth Gods grace into wantonnesse. 7 The difficulty of recovery after relapses. 8 The uncertainty of Gods offer of grace after the frequent refusall thereof. To keepe us in hope, that wee dash not upon the rocke of despaire on the contrary side, let us set before our troubled and affrighted consciences these grounds of comfort: 1 The infinitenesse of Gods mercy. 2 The price and value of Christs blood. 3 The efficacy of his intercession, 4 The vertue of the Sacraments. 5 The universality and certainty of Gods promises to the penitent. 6 The joy of God and Angels for the conversion of a sinner. 7 The communion of Saints, who all pray for the comfort of affli∣cted consciences, and the ease of all that are heavie laden with their sinnes. 8 The examples of mercy shewed to most grievous sinners. Upon these grounds the contrite penitent may build strong forts of com∣fort after this manner. My sins though they be more in number than the heires of my head, yet they are finite, whereas Gods mercy is every way
infinite: if my debt bee as a thousand, my Saviours merits are as infinite millions. And not onely Gods mercy, but his justice also pleads for my pardon: for it is against justice that the same debt should be twice paid, to require a full ransome from my Redeemer, and expect it from my selfe. I Joh. 1.9. confesse my sinnes, and therefore I know he is faithfull and just to forgive mee my sinnes, and cleanse mee from all my unrighteousnesse. One drop of the blood of the Sonne of God was a sufficient price for the ransome of many worlds, and shall not such store of it spinning from his temples, dropping from his hands, gushing out of his side, and trickling from all parts of his body, both in the garden, and in the High Priests Hall, satis∣fie for one poore soule that preferreth his love even before heaven it selfe? All my sinnes are either originall or actuall: the guilt of originall is taken away in baptisme, and as often as I have received the blessed Sa∣crament a generall pardon was tendred unto mee for all my other sinnes, and the seale delivered into my hands. What though God will not heare the prayers of such a sinner as I am? yet he will heare the prayers of Je∣sus Christ the righteous, who is the propitiation for my sinnes. I acknowledge (to my hearts griefe and sorrow) that neither faith nor hope, nor any other divine vertue beareth any sensible fruit in mee for the present; yet the seed of my regeneration remaineth in mee. And as the blind man knew that his sight began to be restored to him, even by the defect he found in it when he thought heMark. 8.24. saw men walke like trees: so even by this I know that I am not utterly destitute of grace, because I feele and unfainedly be∣waile the want of it. If there were no heavenly treasure in mee, Satan would not so often and so furiously assault mee: for theeves besiege not, much lesse breake open those houses where they are perswaded nothing is to be found. The greater my sorrow is for my sinne, and my spirituall desertion, the greater is my hope: for the spirit maketh intercession for the sonnes of GodRom. 8.26. with groaning which cannot be expressed. None were cured by the brazen Serpent, which before had not beene stung by the fiery: neither doth Christ promise ease unto any but to those that feele themselves heavie burdened. But to confine my meditations to the letter of my text. Before ye heard, Repent you of your sinnes and you shall surely live. God pawneth his life for it, therefore despaire not how grievous soever your sinnes be. But now I am to tell you plainly, if you repent you of your repentance, and turne from righteousnesse to sinne, and end your dayes in that state, you shall sure∣ly die eternally: therefore presume not, how compleate soever your former righteousnesse seeme to have beene. In these two verses are implyed a double conversion: 1 From evill to good. 2 From good to evill. To turne from evill, is good; from good, is evill: the former is repen∣tance, upon which I spent my last discourse: the later is relapse or aposta∣cie, against which I am now to bend all my forces. But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousnesse, and commit∣teth iniquity, &c. in the transgression which he hath transgressed, and in the sinne which he hath sinned, in them hee shall surely die. The contents of this
verse are like the Prophet Jeremies figges, of which wee read that the bad were exceeding bad; for in the antecedent or fore-part we have apostacie, & that totall: and in the hinder part or consequent, death, and that finall. The words divide themselves into (first) a supposition, When, or, if the righteous forsake: secondly, an inference, his former righteousnesse shall not be remem∣bred, &c. The supposition is dangerous, the inference is pernicious. To establish you in the truth of this supposition, or rather hypotheticall commination, it will be needfull to lay downe certaine grounds. 1. That the certainty of the end no whit impeacheth the necessary use of all meanes for the attaining it. For the end and meanes are coor∣dinata, and both involved in the same decree. As the meanes are ap∣pointed for the end, so the end is decreed to bee attained by such meanes; for example, the propagation of mankinde by marriage, the main∣taining our temporall life by food and sustenance, the recovery of health by physicke, the reaping the fruits of the earth by manuring and tillage, the governement of the world by lawes, the calling of men to the knowledge of the truth by the Word and Sacraments, the keeping the children of God from presumptuous sinnes by admonitions and comminations. The hea∣then themselves saw a glimmering of this truth: for the Stoicke Philoso∣phers, who taught the foreknowledge of God, and thence inferred inevita∣ble necessity of all events according to that foreknowledge, yet most strict∣ly urged the performance of all morall duties and vertuous actions; and generally, the use of all meanes for the attaining that end any man propo∣seth to himselfe. Bee it thy destiny (say they) to have many children by thy wife, yet thou must not neglect conjugall duties; be it thy desti∣ny to recover of thy disease, yet thou must not neglect the prescrip∣tions of the Physician; bee it thy destiny to conquer thine enemy, yet thou must not forget to bring thy weapon with thee into the field; bee it thy destiny to bee a great Professour in Philosophy, yet thou must not neglect thy study; bee it thy destiny to dye a rich man, yet thou must not be carelesse of thy estate. 2. That this and the like comminations in holy Scripture are spoken generally to all, Elect as well as Reprobate: and they are of speciall use to both; to terrifie the Reprobate, and keepe them within some bounds, or at least to convince their consciences, and debarre them from all excuse at the day of judgement; and to stirre up the Elect to watch∣fulnesse over all their wayes, and diligence and constancy in the use of all such meanes as by Gods grace may keepe them from backe-sliding and dangerous relapses, to hold them in continuall awe, and excite them to make their calling and election sure, and work out their salvation with feare and trembling, as Saint Austine declareth at large through his whole booke de correptione & gratiá. 3. That all Israelites are not true Nathaniels, all converts are not absolutely so, nor all penitents throughly cleansed from their sinnes; many are regenerated but in part, they repent of their sinnes, but not of all, they keepe a sweet bit under their tongue, they have a Dali∣lah in their bosome, or an Herodias at their table, or a Bathsheba in their bed; though they bee healed of all other diseases, yet not of the
plague of the heart, some secret sinne hath a kinde of predominancy in them. Now as the Peacockes flsh, if it hath but an ordinary seething, growes raw againe, cocta recrudescit; and wounds that are not perfectly healed, though they may be skinned over, breake out againe, and bleed afresh; so a man that is not perfectly regenerated in all parts, though hee hath a tast of the heavenly gift, and may beleeve with Simon Magus, and tremble at Gods judgements with Felix, and heare the Word gladly with Herod, and doe many things; yet because the seed of the word hath not taken deepe root in him, it is possible for him with Demas to forsake the Gospel, and em∣brace this present world; with Himeneus and Philetus, to make shipwracke of faith and a good conscience; with Julian to become an Apostata, and a per∣secuter of the truth. 4. The Prophet Ezekiel in this place speaketh not of Evangelicall righ∣teousnesse, but of legall: for he saith not simply when a man turneth from righteousnesse, but from his righteousnesse. And vers. 5. hee defineth a just man to be he That doth that which is lawfull and right, and hath not eaten upon the mountaines, nor defiled his neighbours wife, &c. Now whatsoever may be alledged for the stability of evangelicall righteousnesse, and their permanency who are engraffed into the true Vine, Christ Jesus; daily ex∣perience sheweth that the most righteous on earth may and somtimes do re∣mit of their strict observance of their duty; & that it is not only possible, but very facile for them to let loose the reines to sensuall desires, and to follow the gainefull, or ambitious, or voluptuous courses of the world, at least for a time. For the way to heaven is up-hill, but the way to hell is down-hill, and thither the weight of our sinfull flesh forcibly tendeth. —Facilis discensus averni. A man may without any paine slip downe to the place of everlasting paines and torments: Yea (saith Seneca) aDe mort. Clau. Caes. Om∣nia proclivia sunt, facilè d∣scenditur, it{que} qumvis poda gricus momen∣to temporis pervenit ad ja∣nuam ditis. gouty man may get thither in a trice: Sed revocare gradum, superasque evadere ad auras, Hoc opus, hic labor est. But saith the Poet, all the labour is to come backe from hell, and get up out of the deep pit: so hee. But the truth is, no labour can worke it, no skill com∣passe it: for from hell there is no redemption. Wee know there is great strength required to bend a bow of steele, which will unbend it selfe, if the string breake or but slip. Our motions to God-ward, and proceedings in a sanctified course of life, are like the rowing of a small boat against a strong wind and tide (the blasts of the evill spirit, and the propension of our cor∣rupt nature) much labour and sweat is required, and very little is done with much adoe; and if wee slcke our hands, and misse but one stroake, we are carried downe with the streame, and cast further backe than wee can fetch againe with many stroakes. Did not Solomon turne away from his righte∣ousnesse, and commit iniquity, and doe according to all the abominations of the wicked, when he defiled his body and soule with spirituall and cor∣porall fornication? Did not David likewise, when he spilt the bloud of U∣riah, that hee might more freely stay in the bed of Bathsheba? I spare the
rest (because I would be loth with my breath to stain the golden and sil∣ver vessels of the Sanctuary) and come à Thesi ad Hypothesin, from the indefinite to the singular, from the hearers at large to this present audi∣tory. Ye heare out of the Text how incommodious and dangerous a thing it is for a righteous man to degenerate, and turne away from his righteous∣nesse; it depriveth him of all the benefit of his former travells in the way to heaven: it blasteth all the fruits of his labours, & without a second return to God, dasheth all his hope of reward, & leaveth him in a fearfull expectati∣on of eternall death. I doubt not but that some of you were pricked in heart with this sharp reproofe of sinne, which ye heard in the handling of the for∣mer Verses, and ye resolved forthwith to turne from your evill wayes, and walke in the pathes of Gods commandments: what remaines but that yee hold on your holy course, to the end that ye may winne a garland of the flowers of Paradise? Beware of turning out of the way, to take up the gol∣den apples which the Divell casteth before you; if ye turne never so little aside, ye endanger your crowne of glory, and hazzard your lives. All your former righteousnesse which ye have done shall not be mentioned, and in the trespasse that yee have trespassed, and in the sinne that ye have sin∣ned, in them yee shall dye. What a soule and shamefull thing is it with the dogge to returne to your vomit of luxury, and with the swine to your wallow∣ing in the mire of sensuall pleasures? As in the diseases of the body, so also much more of the soule, all relapses are dangerous, and in some diseases al∣together incurable: the reason whereof alledged by some learned Physici∣ans is this, that when wee first take our bed the malignity of the disease worketh upon corrupt humours in the body, which when they are purged, and we restored to health, if after by any distemper we fall into the same malady, the malignity of the disease worketh upon our vitall spirits: in like manner the malignity of sinne before our conversion worketh but upon our corrupt nature, but after upon the graces of Gods Spirit. Remember the possessed man in the Gospel, who when theLuke 11.26. uncleane spirit went out of him returned to his owne home, and finding it swept and garnished, took seven worse spirits than that which before haunted him, and so his last state was worse than his first.John 8.11. Sinne no more, saith our Saviour to the impotent man, lest a worse thing befall thee.. Improbè Neptunum ac∣cusat, qui bis naufragium fecit. Eras. A∣dag. Lysimachus was wont to say, that it was impardonable carelesnesse to stumble twice at the same stone. The first time we offend we may plead ignorance and over-sight: but hee that twice runneth upon the same rocke, if hee bee cast away, cannot blame his hard chance, but his retchlesse folly.Tertul. de poenitent. Comparatio∣nem videtur egisse, qui utrumque cog∣noverit, & judicato pro∣nunciasse eum meliorem cujus se rursus esse maluerit. Tertullian acutely observeth, that he who after his con∣version to God, and giving his name to Christ, falls againe to serve Sathan in any vicious course of life, seemeth to have put God and the Divell in the same ballance, and having weighed both their services deliberately, and upon a settled judgement, to have preferred the service of the Divell, and pronounced him the better Master of the two, whom he the second time chuseth to serve after hee hath made tryall of both. To be overtaken with some kind of temptation or other is the lot of all the sonnes of Adam; but when God hath delivered us out of the snare of the Divell, and we have
escaped the danger, and undertaken a new course of life, and held it for some time; then to turne backe to the wiles of sinne, and walke of Sathan, what is it else than to breake all our former promises and vowes made to God? to resist the motions of the Spirit? to strive against grace? to cast his feare and commandements behind us? and, presuming upon his gen∣tlenesse and patience, to runne desperately upon the point of his glitte∣ring sword, which hee hath whet, and threatned to make it drunke with the bloud of all retchlesse and presumptuous sinners? Notwithstanding all these great and fearfull dangers which we incurre by relapses, how ma∣ny turnings doe we make in our way to Heaven? how often doe wee slacke our pace? how often doe wee unbend our desires? nay rather flye backe like a broken bow? After wee have made an open confession of our sinnes, and a solemne profession of amendment; after wee have protested against our former courses, and vowed to walke in newnesse of life, and taken the holy Sacrament of our Lords blessed body and bloud upon it, yet how soone doe we looke backe to Sodome with Lots wife? how soone doe we forget that in private, which we promised in publike? how soone doe we leave the strait pathes of Gods commandements, and follow the sent of our former sinfull pleasures? After we have eaten the food of Angels, we devoure Sathans morsels: after we have drunke the bloud of our Redeemer, we greedily swill in iniquity like water. Wee find in Scripture many de∣sperately sicke, yet cured the first time by our Saviour: but where doe we reade in all the Gospel of any blind mans eyes twice enlightened? of any deafe eares twice opened? of any tyed tongue twice loosened? of any possessed with Divels twice dispossessed? of any dead twice raised? No doubt Christ could have done it, but we reade not that ever he did it, that we should be most carefull to avoid relapses into our former sins, the recovery whereof is alwayes most difficult, and in some case (as the Apostle teach∣eth us) impossible. I tremble almost to rehearse his words:Heb. 6.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. It is impossi∣ble for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, and have tasted the good Word of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they shall fall away, to renew them againe unto repentance: seeing they crucifie to themselves the Sonne of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. For the earth which drinketh in the raine that commeth oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbes meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: But that which bringeth thornes and bryars is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be bur∣ned. ThePlin. nat. hist. l. 9. c. 43. Scolopendra hamo devorato omnia interio∣ra evomit, do∣nec hamum e∣gerat, deinde resorbet. Scolopendra having devoured the bait, when shee feeleth the hooke to pricke her, casteth up all that is in her belly till shee have got up the hooke; but as soone as ever that is out of her bowells, she suppeth up all that which before she had cast from her. How excellently hath nature in the property of this fish set before our eyes the condition and manner of a sinner? who after he hath devoured Sathans morsells, feeling the hook in his conscience, and being pricked with some remorse, rids the stomacke of his soule by confession, and never leaveth fasting, and praying, and sighing, and sobbing till the hooke be out, and the wound of his conscience healed with the balme of Gilead; but that being done, resorbet interiora omnia, he returneth to his former vomit, and greedily gurmandizeth the bait which
before he had vomited up. Beloved, is God bound to help us up as often as we fall carelesly and wilfully? What if hee let us lye as a prey for the Di∣vell, who runneth about like a Lion seeking whom hee may devoure? Can we promise our selves a continuall supply of grace, if wee still turne it in∣to wantonnesse? Will he beleeve our sighes and teares, which have so oft proved false embassadours of our hearts? Wee see by the fearfull judge∣ments of Ananias and Sapphira how dangerous a thing it is to lye to the Spirit of God: what doe we else when we daily professe in our prayers, that we are heartily sorry for our sinnes, that we loath and detest our vicious courses, that the remembrance of all our former transgressions is grievous unto us, and the burthen of them is intolerable; whereas our deeds testifie to the world, that we are so farre from loathing our former filthinesse, that we hunger and thirst after it: so farre from hearty repentance, that our heart is set, and our affections wholly bent to follow wickednesse with gree∣dinesse? Let us not deceive our owne soules, Beloved, God we cannot: so many sinnes as we willingly commit after our humble confession and seem∣ing contrition, so many evidences we give against our selves that we are dissembling hypocrites, and not sincere penitents: for this is the touch∣stone of true repentance, it a plangere commissa, ut non committas plangen∣da, so to bewaile that we have committed, that we commit not that we have bewailed. I before compared this life to a sea, and now I may not unfitly most of the fish in it either to the Scolopendra, of which before, or to the Crab, which either standeth still or swimmeth backward. Doe we dreame (as Nebuchadnezzar did) of an image with an head of gold, and armes of silver, and thighes of brasse, and legges of earth and clay? Doe we not see many that are gold and silver in their childhood and youth preci∣ous vessels of grace, brasse and iron in their riper yeeres, and no better than earth and clay in their old age? ThePlin. lib. 8. c. 16. Aristo∣teles tradit Leaenam pri∣mo soetu 5. ca∣tulos, ac per annos singulos uno minus, ab uno sterile∣scere. Lionesse in the naturall story, which at the first bringeth forth five young ones, and after fewer by one, in a short time becommeth quite barren. But because I have spoken at large of the dangerous antecedent, heare (I beseech you) a word of the dreadfull consequent: All his righteousnesse that he hath done shall not bee mentioned. Would it not vexe a Scrivener af∣ter he had spent many dayes and much paines upon a large Patent or Lease, to make such a blot at the last word, that he should be forced to write it all againe? yet so it is, that as one foule blot or dash with a pen defaceth a whole writing, so one soule and enormous crime dasheth and obliterateth the fairest copy of a vertuous life, it razeth out all the golden characters of divine graces imprinted in our soules. All our fastings and prayers, all our sighing and mourning for our sinnes, all our exercises of piety, all our deeds of charity, all our sufferings for righteousnesse, all the good thoughts we have ever conceived, all the good words we have ever utte∣red, all the good workes we have ever performed: in a word, all our righ∣teousnesse is lost at the very instant, when we resolve to turne from it. As one drop of inke coloureth a whole glasse of cleere water; so one sinfull and shamefull action staineth all our former life: yet this is not the worst; for it followeth: In his transgression that he hath committed, and in the sinne that he hath
sinned, in them hee shall dye. Doth God threaten this judgement onely? doth hee not execute it upon presumptuous transgressours? When Bal∣thazar tooke a peece of the plate of the Sanctuary to quaffe in it, be∣hold presently aDan. 5.5. hand writing his doome upon the wall; and in the trans∣gression that hee had committed, and in the sinne that hee had sinned, in it hee dyed. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram had no sooner opened their mouth against Moses, than theNum. 16.32. earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up quicke, and in the trespasse which they had trespassed, and in the sinne which they had sinned, in it they dyed. Ananias and Sapphira had no sooner told a lye to Saint Peter, and stood to it, but they wereAct. 5.5, 10. strucke downe to the ground, and in the trespasse that they trespassed, and in the sinne that they sinned, in it they dyed. Herod had scarce made an end of his oration to the people, and received their applause, crying, The voice of God, and not of man, when the Angel madeAct. 12.22, 23. an end of him, and in the trespasse which hee trespassed, and in the sinne that he sinned, in it bee dyed. Oh that our blas∣phemous swearers, and bloudy murderers, and uncleane adulterers, and sacrilegious Church-robbers, when the Divell edges them on to any im∣piety or villany, would cast but this rub in their way: What if God should take mee in the manner, and strike mee in the very act I am about, and cast mee into the deep dungeon of Hell, there to be tormented with the Divell and his angels for evermore? Doe I not provoke him to it? Doe I not dare him? Hath hee not threatened as much? Hath hee not done as much? Nonne cuivis contingere potest quod cuiquam potest? that which is ones case, may it not be any ones case? Yea, but they will say, God is mercifull. Hee is so (else the most righteous upon earth would despaire a thousand times) but not to those that continually abuse his long-suffe∣ring, and presume upon his mercy. If there beDeut. 29.19, 20. among you (saith God by Moses) a root that beareth gall and wormwood, and it come to passe that when hee heareth the words of this curse, that he blesse himselfe in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walke in the imagination of mine heart to adde drunkennesse to thirst: the Lord will not spare him, but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousie shall smoake against that man, and all the curses that are written in this booke shall lye upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven. Yea, but God promiseth pardon at all times to the penitent. But where doth he promise at all times grace to repent? Be it that God would tender us his grace at what houre wee please, which is presumption in us to hope for, yet the longer we deferre the applying of the remedy, the more pain∣full and dangerous the cure will be. In the conversive proposition concer∣ning our conversion to God, I admit of the convertens, viz. True repen∣tance is never too late; so they will take along with them the conversa, viz. that late repentance is seldome true. Howsoever, what piety is it? nay what equity? nay rather what abominable iniquity and impiety is it florem Dia∣bolo consecrare, faeces Deo reservare? To consecrate the flower of their youth to the Divell, the world, and the flesh, and reserve the lees or dregges of their old age for God? To dedicate to him our weake and feeble dotage if we live to it, what is it better than to offer theDeut. 15.21. blind and the lame for sacrifice, which God abhorreth? Repent therefore repentè, repent at the first offer
of grace. Ye shall scarce find any precept of repentance in Scripture, which requireth not as well that it be out of hand, as that it be from the heart: Remember thyEccles. 12.1.

THE DEFORMITY OF HALTING THE LVII. SERMON. 1 KIN. 18.21. And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt ye betweene two opi∣nions? If the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him: and the people answered not a word. Right Honourable, &c. ELijah, who sometimes called for fire from heaven, was himselfe full of heavenly fire, the fire of zeale for the Lord of Hosts. His words, like fire, 1 Give light, 2 Heate, 3 Consume. 1 They give light to this undoubted truth, That one, and but one Religi∣on is to be embraced: either God or Baal must be worshipped, in no case both. Stand firme to one: How long halt ye betweene two? 2 They heate and enflame true zeale and devotion: If the Lord be God, follow him. 3 They burne up indifferencie and neutralitie: If Baal be he, goe after him. This passage of Scripture relateth a Sermon of Elijah; wherein we are to note more particularly, 1 The Preacher, Elijah. 2 The Auditorie, the whole Parliament of Israel. 3 The Text or Theame handled by him, viz. What God is to be worshipped, what religion to be established and maintained by Prince and people? Now although I perswade my selfe that there is none in this whole as∣sembly who halteth betweene the Popish and reformed Churches, or hath
once bowed his knee to the Romish Baal: yet because Satan hath of late not only turned himselfe into an Angell of light, to dazle the eyes of weake Christians in point of Doctrine, but also into a Seraphim of heat and zeale, under colour of devotion to bring us to offer strange fire upon Gods Altar; and especially because there is no lamp of the Sanctuarie that bur∣neth so brightly, but that it needeth oyle continually to be powred into it to feed the flame: the opening of this Scripture cannot but be seasonable and usefull to reduce you into the path, if you swerve from it never so lit∣tle; or to prick you on, if you are in the right way that leadeth to the king∣dome of God. The key to open this Text is the occasion of this exhor∣tation of the Prophet: wherefore before I proceed to the exposition of the words, I must entreat you to cast a looke backwards to the occasion of them, and the cause of the peoples haulting downe-right: a circumstance not giving more light to the right understanding of the Prophets reproofe, than strength to our stedfast standing, and upright walking in the high way to Heaven. What the religious Father spake by way of Apologie, for handling controversall points in the pulpit, Ideo non dubitavimus dubita∣re, ut vos non dubitaretis, We therefore make no scruple to move doubts, that yee may not doubt, but upon the solution of them, be more settled in your most holy faith; I may say truly, that therefore I hold it needfull to make a stay at the cause of the poeples haulting, that their haulting may be no stay to your godly proceedings, that you may never hault upon their ground, which was so slipperie that they slid now this way, now that way, not able to set sure footing any where. Elijah by his divine commission drew them to Gods Altar; but Ahab, especially at the instigation of Jezebel, by his royall power enforced them to offer at Baals groves: between both they were miserably perplexed, their minds distracted, and their worship divi∣ded betweene God and Baal. Men are led by examples more than precepts, especially by the exam∣ples of Princes or Potentates, which carrie a kinde of Sovereigntie over mens affections and manners, as they themselves have over their persons: insomuch, that their morall vices, yea and naturall deformities also, have beene drawne and patterned out by some of their subjects, as if they were vertues and gracefull ornaments.Jan. Grut. annot. in Tac. . Diodorus Siculus telleth us in sober sad∣nesse, that it was the custome of the Aethiopians to maime or lame them∣selves in that part or foot on which their Prince limped, because they thought it a great disparagement for their Prince, that any about him should goe more upright, or have a more gracefull gate than hee. And Atheneus likewise reporteth of Dionysius his familiars, that because himselfe was somewhat purblinde, they, as they sate at table, reached towards di∣shes as it were by aime, and sometimes missed, that they might not seeme more quick-sighted than he. And to make up the number, when Philip re∣ceived a wound in his eye, Clisophus, as if hee had got a blow on the same eye, putteth a patch on it: and when afterwards Philip was run thorow the right thigh, in comes Clisophus all to be plaistered on that thigh, and out-halteth his Master. We can hardly hold laughing when we read or heare of the madnesse, rather than folly, of so grosse flatterie; yet wee have cause rather to weepe at the sight of a farre worse flatterie, and yet most usuall,
whereby some indeere themselves into great personages, by imitating their vices and profane carriage. To expresse these, they account it a kinde of merit of favour, or at least an homage due to their greatnesse, because (saithLactant. di∣vin. instit. l. 5. c. 6. Et quo∣niam regis vitta imitari obsequii quod∣dam genus est, abjecerunt om∣nes pietatem ne regi scelus exprobrare vi∣derentur. & lib. c. 23. Ho∣mines malunt exempla quam verba, &c. Lactantius) to imitate the vices of Princes and Nobles, is a Court-comple∣ment, nay a part of the service and obsequiousnesse due to their persons: all men in Jupiters time castaway the feare of God, lest they should seeme to up∣braid ungodlinesse to their King. Wherefore no marvell sith Ahab was starke lame on his right leg, that the Israelites here, after the manner of Cli∣sophus, followed him limping, looking sometimes to Gods Altar, some∣times to Baals. O the subtiltie of the enemie of our soules! how many fet∣ches and turnings hath that wily Serpent to get in his head? if he get it not one way by Atheisme, nor the contrarie by Superstition, yet hee hath a third way, to slide in by indifferencie. Whom he cannot bring to coldnesse in the true religion, or hot eagernesse in the false, he laboureth with a soft fire to make luke-warme, as he did the people of Israel, to whom hee sug∣gested these, or the like thoughts. Alas, what shall we doe? we are even at our wits end, our weake and weather beaten bark is betwixt two rocks, stand still wee cannot, the wind is so strong. If wee steere one way, wee make shipwrack of our lives and goods; if the other, of faith and a good conscience: to this streight we are driven, either we must forsake our re∣ligion, or trench upon our allegeance: God and the King stand in com∣petition. Neither as the matter now standeth, is it possible to serve, much lesse please both: if wee cleave stedfastly to God, wee shall be cloven in peeces, and hewen asunder by Ahab; if we cleave not to him, wee forsake our owne mercie, and the rocke of our salvation: if wee burne incense to Baal, we shall frie our selves in hell fire; if we sacrifice unto God, Ahab will mingle our owne bloud with our sacrifices. Wee must needs indan∣ger, either our soules or our bodies, our estate or our conscience. Why, is there no meanes to save both? Wee hope there is, by dividing our selves betweene God and Baal: God shall have the one, and Baal the other: our heart wee will keepe for God, but Baal shall have our hands and knees at his service: though wee visit Baals groves, Baal shall never come into our thoughts: even then when we offer incense unto Baal, we will offer the incense of our prayers on the Altar of our heart to the God of our fathers. By this meanes wee are sure to hold faire quarter with Ahab, and we hope also to keepe in with God, to whom we give the bet∣ter part. Yea, but this is no better than halting betweene both. Be it so, is it not better to halt, thinke you, than to lose both legs? And what shame is it for us thus to halt, sith the Prince and chiefe Priests doe no otherwise? They are our guides, and if they mislead us, let them beare the blame. As the people thus reasoned with themselves, and after much swagging on both sides, in the end came to fix and resolve upon this middle way: out commeth the Prophet Elijah, and fearing no colours, presenteth him∣selfe first to Ahab, and afterward to the people: by Ahab hee is entertai∣ned with this discourteous salutation, Art thou hee that troubleth Israel? How darest thou appeare in my presence? The Prophet as well appointed with patience to beare, as the King armed with rage to strike, encountreth
the King on this wise; It is not I that trouble Israel, but thou and thy fa∣thers house; in that yee have forsaken the commandements of the Lord, and have followed Baal. Wee see here by the freedome of the Prophets re∣proofe, that though the servants of God may be in bonds, yet the word of God is not bound; nay it bindeth Ahab and all his servants to their good be∣haviour, they cannot stirre hand or foot against the Prophet. They are so farre from silencing him, that in Gods name hee commands them, saying; Send and gather unto me all Israel unto Mount Carmel, and the Prophets of Baal foure hundred and fifty, and the Prophets that eat at Jezebels table. The King taketh the word from Elijah, and gives it to the people, and a Parliament is on the sudden assembled, wherein Elijah is the speaker: his speech is an invective against unsettled neutrality, and dissembling in mat∣ter of religion: unsettlednesse is taxed in the word halt; indifferency in the words, betweene two opinions; dissembling and temporizing in the words following, if the Lord be God, follow him. How long halt yee betweene two opinions? The Prophet here useth no flourish at all, no prolusion after the manner of Fencers, but presently hee fals to blowes, and that so smart, that he stunned his adversaries: for so we read, they answered him never a word?Cic. Catil. 2. Quous{que} tan∣dem abutêre Catilina pati∣entiâ nostrâ? & Phil. 2. Quniam meo fo fieri dicam P.C. & Muret. orat. Ergo hoc miseris Gallis? &c. How long halt yee? An abrupt Ex∣ordium becommeth a man that is in a vehement passion: such an one now surprized Elijah; the Baalites profaning Gods name, polluting his Altars, slaying his Prophets, heat him above his ordinary constitution. In such a case as this was to have been luke-warm, had been little better than key-cold. When God is highly dishonoured, the true religion wronged, grosse ido∣latry patronized, not to bee moved, is an argument either of insincerity or cowardice: Patientia digna omni impatientiâ: Such patience is insuffera∣ble, such silence is a crying sinne, such temper a distemper. Wherefore no marvell if Elijahs spirit, in which there was alwayes an intensive heat, now flamed, and his words were no other than so many sparks of fire. How long halt yee betweene two opinions? Not why? but how? not doe ye now? but how long will ye? not lose or misse your way, or goe awry, but halt? not in a wrong path, but betweene two wayes? How ag∣gravateth the unseemelinesse of their gate by their manner, long by the continuance, halt by the deformity, betweene two opinions by the uncer∣tainty. Is it not a most shamefull thing to halt after an unseemely manner for a long time betweene two wayes, not certaine which to take or leave? Out of the manner of Elijahs reproofe observe the duty of a faithfull Minister of God, when just cause is given to bee round with his hearers, and to reprove them plainly, calling halting halting: if they do not so they halt in their duty, and the vengeance of God is like to overtake them, denoun∣ced by the Prophet Jeremie;Jer. 23.31, 32 Behold, I will come against the Prophets that have sweet tongues, and say, He saith. Behold, I am against them that prophe∣sie false dreames, saith the Lord, and doe tell them, and cause my people to erre by their lyes and by their lightnesse, yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all. But because this note sorteth not well with this time and this queere, I leave it, and insist rather upon those that follow, the first whereof is the consideration of the time, or rather duration of this infirmity in the people.
How long? They that are sound in their limbes, may by a small straine or blow upon their legs halt for a while, but sure long to halt is a signe of some dangerous spraine or rupture: now this people (as it should seeme) halted in this manner at least three yeeres. The strongest and soundest Christian sometimes halteth in his minde betweene two opinions, nay which is worse, betweene religion and superstition, faith and diffidence, hope and despaire: but hee halts not long, Christ by his word and spirit cureth him. As in our bodies, so in our soules we have some distempers; doubts suddenly arise in our minds as sparks out of the fire, which yet are quenched in their very as∣cending, and appeare not at all after the breath of Gods spirit hath kindled a flame of truth in our understanding. Heresies and morall vices are like quagmires, wee may slightly passe over them without any great danger: but the longer we stand upon them the deeper wee sinke, and if wee bee not drowned over head and eares in them, yet we scape not without much mire and dirt. HereofConfess. lib. 3. c. 11. Novem ferme anni sunt quibus ego in illo limo pro∣fundi & tene∣bris falsitatis, cum saepius surgere conarer & gravius alli∣derer volutatus sum. S. Augustine had lamentable experience during the space of many yeeres, in which he stucke fast in the heresie of the Manichees: Had I but (saith he) slipt onely into the errour of the Manichees, and soone got out of it, my case had beene lesse fearefull and dangerous; but God knowes that for almost nine yeares I wallowed in that mud; the more I strived to get out the faster I stucke in. Beloved, if wee have not beene so happy as to keepe out of the walke of the ungodly, yet let us bee sure not to stand in the way of sinners, much lesse sit in the seat of the scornefull: if wee are not so pure and cleane as we desire, at least let us not with Moab settle upon the lees of our corruption: if wee ever have halted as Jacob did, yet let us not long halt with the Israelites, whom here Elijah reproveth, saying, How long Halt yee? It may be, and is very likely that many of the Israelites ran to Baals groves and altars, and yet they were liable to this reproofe of Elijah. For though we run never so fast in a wrong way, we doe no better than halt before God. Better halt (saith S. Austine) in the way, than run out of the way. This people did neither, they neither ran out of the way, nor limped in the way; but halted betweene two wayes, and missed both. Betweene two opinions. Had they beene in the right way, yet halting in it, the night might have overtaken them before they came to the period of their journey; but now being put out of their way, and moving so slowly as they did, though the Sun should haue stood still as it did in the valley of Ajalon, they were sure never to arrive in any time to the place where they would be. Yet had they beene in any way, perhaps in a long time it would have brought them, though not home, yet to some baiting place; but now being betweene two waies their case was most desperate: yet this is the case of those whom the world admireth for men of a deep reach & discreet car∣riage: they are forsooth none of your Simon Zelotes, Ahab shall never ac∣cuse them, as hee doth here Elijah, for troubling Israel with their religion, they keepe it close enough: whatsoever they beleeve in private (if at least they beleeve any thing) they in publike wil be sure to take the note from the Srate, & either fully consort with it, or as least strike so soft a stroake, that they will make no jarre in the musick. Besides other demonstrations of the folly of these men, their very inconstancy and unsettlednesse convinceth them of it: for mutability and often changing, even in civill affaires that are most
subject to change, is an argument of weaknesse; but inconstancie in religi∣on, which is alwayes constant in the same, is a note of extreme folly. Whence it is that the spirit of God taxeth this vice under that name, as, Oh yee foolish Galatians, who hath bewitchd you? Are yee so foolish?Chap. 3.1, 3, 4. having be∣gun in the Spirit, are yee now made perfect in the flesh? Have yee suffered so many things in vaine? And,Ephes. 4.14. Be not like children tossed to and fro, and carried about with everie wind of doctrine. If religion be not only the foundation of Kingdomes and Common-wealths, but also of everie mans private e∣state, what greater folly or rather madnesse can there be, than to build all theMatth. 7.26. securitie of our present and hope of our future well-fare upon a sandie foundation? He that heareth my words and doth them not, is likened to a foo∣lish man which buildeth his house upon the sand. All the covenants betweene God and us, of all that we hold from his bountie, are with a condition of our service and fealtie: which sith a man unsettled in religion neither doth, nor ever can performe, hee can have no assurance of any thing that hee pos∣sesseth, no content in prosperitie, no comfort in adversitie, no right to the blessings of this life, no hope of the blessednesse of the life to come: what religion soever gaine heaven, he is sure to lose it. Whether the Lord be God, or Baal be God, neither of them will entertaine such halting servi∣tours. Were he not worthy to be begged for a foole, that after much cau∣tiousnesse and reservednesse, would make his bargaine so, that he were sure to sit downe with the losse? such matches maketh the worldly-wise man; howsoever the world goe, whether the true or the false religion prevaile in the State, while hee continueth resolved of neither, hee is sure to lose the pearle which the rich merchant sold all that he had to buy. What shall I speak of inward wars and conflicts in his conscience? Now he hath strong induce∣ments to embrace the Gospel, shortly after meeting with a cunning Jesuit, he is perswaded by him that he is an Enfant perdue, out of all hope of sal∣vation if he be not reconciled to the Roman Church: the next day fal∣ling aboord with the brethren of the separation, he beginneth to thinke the Brownists the onely pure and refined Christians; for all other Christians, if we beleeve them, build upon the foundation hay and stubble, but they gold, silver, and precious stones. When he is out of these skirmishes, and at leisure to commune with his owne heart, his conscience chargeth him with Atheisme, indifferencie in religion, and hollow-hearted neutralitie. Adde we hereunto the judgement of all understanding men, who esteeme such as double with God, and are of a changeable religion, to have no faithful∣nesse or honestie. By how much the graces and perfections of the mind ex∣ceed those of the body, by so much the imperfections and deformities of the one surpasse the other: what may wee then judge of wavering incon∣stancie, which is compared to a spirituall palsey, or an halting in the mind? Halt yee. Though the metaphor of halting used in my text might signi∣fie either a slacknesse or slownesse in the way of godlinesse, or a maime in some member or article of their faith: yet, according to the scope of the place, and consent of the best Expositors, I interpret it unsettled wave∣ring and inconstancie. For he that halteth is like a man of a giddie braine in a cock-boat or wherrie, who turneth the boat sometimes this way, some∣times that way, not knowing where to set sure footing. The opposite vertue
to this vice is a stedfast standing in the true faith; whereto S. Paul exhor∣teth the Corinthians,Cor. 15.58. Therefore my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmove∣able, alwayes abounding in the worke of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labour is not in vaine in the Lord. And the Colossians, If yee con∣tinue in the faithChap. 1.23. grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospell: and for it he heartily prayeth; For this cause I bowEphes. 3.14, 16, 17, 18, 19. my knees to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that hee would grant you according to the riches of his glorie, to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that yee being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the bredth, & length, & depth, & height: & to know the love of Christ which passeth know∣ledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulnes of God. The Pythagorians, who delighted to represent morall truths by mathematicall figures, described a good man by a cube; whence grew the proverb, Homo undi{que} quadratus, A perfect square man everie way. The reason of this embleme is taken from the uniformitie & stabilitie of this figure, which consisteth of six sides ex∣actly equall, & on which soever it falleth it lies stedfast. As the needle in the mariners compasse, while it waggleth to & fro till it be settled & fixed to the North-point, giveth no direction: no more doth our faith till it be set∣tled unmoveably, & pointeth directly to the true religion, which is the only Cynosure to guide our brittle barks to the faire havens where we would be. Between two opinions. It is bad to halt, but worse (as I shewed before) to halt betweene two opinions: which may be done two manner of wayes. 1. Either by leaving both, & keeping a kind of middle way betwixt them. 2. Or by often crossing from one to the other, and sometimes going or rather limping in the one and sometimes in the other. The former is their hainous sinne who in diversitie of religions are of none, the latter of them who are of all. The former S.Confess. l. 6. c. 1. Cum ma∣ indicassem non me qui∣dem j esse Maniaem, sed nec Ca∣tholicum Christianum. Austine confesseth with teares to have beene his piteous case, when being reclaimed from the heresie of the Manichees, and yet not fully perswaded of the truth of the Catholique cause, he was for the time neither Catholique nor Manichee. Which estate of his soule he fitly compareth to their bodily malady, who after a long and grievous disease, at the criticall houres, as they call them, feele suddenly a release of paine, yet no increase of strength or amendment: at which time they are in greater danger than when they had their extreme fits on them, because if they mend not speedily they end. For there can be no stay in this middle estate betweene sicknesse and health. The wise Law-giver of Athens, Solon, outlawed and banished all those, who in civill contentions joyned not themselves to one part. How just this Law may be in Common wealths on earth, I dispute not: this I am sure of, that our heavenly Law-giver will banish all such out of his Kingdome, who in the Church civill warres with Heretiques, joyne not themselves to one part, I meane the Catholique and Orthodox. The Praetor of the Samnites spake to good purpose in their Senate, when the matter was debated whether they should take part with the Romans against other Greekes, or carrie themselves as neuters.Media via neque amicos patit, neque iniicos tol∣li. This middle way (saith hee) which some would have us take as the safest for us, because thereby we shall provoke neither partie, as bolding faire quarter with both, is the unsafest way of all; for it will neither
procure us friends, nor take away our enemies. Of the same minde was the great Statesman Aristenus, who after hee had weighed reasons on all sides,Romanos aut socios ha∣bere, aut ho∣stes oportere, mediam viam nullam esse. Liv. Dec. 4. l. 1. Macedo∣num legati Aetolis; sò, ac nequiqum cum Doi∣num Roma∣num habebitis, socium Phi∣lippum quae∣retis. resolved that the Romans so peremptorily demanding aid of them as they did, they must of necessitie either enter into confederacie & strict league with them, or be at deadly fewd; that middle way there was none. Apply you this to the Roman faith, and it is a theologicall veritie; upon necessitie wee must either hold communion with the Roman Church, or professedly impugne her and her errours. God cursedudg. 5.23. Meros for not taking part with the Isra∣elites against their and Gods enemies: and Christ in the Gospel openly professeth,Matt 12.30. He that is not with me is against me. Media ergo via nulla est. The second kinde of halting betweene two opinions, may be observed in those, who are sometimes of one and sometimes of another. Men of this temper, though they seeme to be neerer health than others, yet indeed they are in more danger; as the Angell ofApoc. 3.16. Laodicea his censure maketh it a cleare case. For though they may seem to be more religious than they who professe no religion: yet sith it is impossible that truth & falshood should stand together, all their religion will be found to be nothing else but dissi∣mulation, and so worse than professed irreligion. Here that speech of Philip concerning his two sonsPlut. Apoph. . Hecaterus and Amphoterus, may have place: He∣caterus is Amphoterus, and Amphoterus is Udeterus, that is, hee whose name is Either of the two, is worth Both, but he whose name is Both is neither. The Nazarean Heretiques (saith S. Austine) while they will be bothAug. de haer. Ad quod vult Deum. 2 Kings 17. 29, 30, 33. Jewes and Christians, prove neither one nor the other. Doth zealous Austine say so only? doth not the holy Spirit confirme it, that they who embrace or main∣taine more religions are indeed of none? How read we? The people of divers nations (saith the text) whom the King of Assur planted in Samaria feared the Lord, but served other gods. Now let us hear the censure of the holy Ghost, which followes, To this day they doe after the old manner: they neither feare God, nor doe after their ordinances, nor after the Law, nor after the comman∣dement which the Lord commanded the children of Jacob; Feare no other gods, nor bow to them, nor sacrifice to them. Hence we may strongly infer, that Ambodexters as they are called, are Ambosinisters, & Omnifidians are Nul∣lifidians: and that there is no greater enemie to true religion than worldly policie, which under pretence of deliberation hindreth sound resolution, under pretence of discretion extinguisheth true zeale, under colour of mo∣deration slackeneth or stoppeth all earnest contention for our most holy faith; yet without contention no victorie, without victorie no crowne. How should they ever hope to bee incorporated into Christ, whom hee threateneth to spue out of his mouth? But I hope better things of all here present, though I thus speake, and things that accompanie salvation, through the sincere and powerfull preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ among you. Cui, &c.
OLD AND NEW IDOLATRY PARALLELED. THE LVIII. SERMON. 1 KINGS 18.21. If the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. Right Honourable, &c. THe summe and substance of the speech made by the Prophet Elijah before King Ahab, the Nobles and Commons of Israel assembled on Mount Carmel, is a quicke and sprightly reproofe of wavering unsettled∣nesse, fearfull lukewarmnesse, and temporizing hypocri∣sie in matter of Religion, which we are stedfastly to re∣solve upon, openly to professe, and zealously to maintain even with striving unto bloud, which is gloriously dyed by death for the truth with the tincture of Martyrdome. How long halt yee between two opini∣ons? &c. This reprehensory exhortation, or exhortatory reprehension was occasioned by the mammering in which the people were at this time: the causes whereof I lately enquired into, to the end that as the fall of the Jewes became the rise of the Gentiles; so the halting of the Israelites between the right way and the wrong, might prove our speedy running in the race of godlinesse to the goale of perfection, for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. The cause which I then declared unto you of their halting between two opinions was this: Ahab (instigated especially by his wife Jezebel, partly by his example, but much more by furiously brandi∣shing before them the sword reking with the hot bloud of the slaughtered Prophets and servants of the true God) drove them to Baals groves, where
they prostrated themselves before that abominable Idoll, and offered the flames of their Holocausts to the bright beames of the Sunne. This their bowing to Baal, and burning incense to the host of Heaven, so incensed the God of Heaven, that he barred up the windowes of Heaven, and punished their not thirsting after the water of life, with such a drouth, that not men only and beasts, but the earth also every where chopped & gasped for some moisture to refresh her dried bowels, which for the space of wel-nigh three yeers had no other irrigation than the effusion of Saints bloud. The people thus miserably perplexed, as being persecuted on the one side by the Prince, and plagued on the other side by God himselfe, in the end faint, and yeeld to the worship both of God & Baal. The crafty Serpent of Paradise resembleth the Serpent called Amphisbaena, which hath two heads, & mo∣veth contrary wayes at the same time. For when hee could not make them hot in Idolatry by feare, he cooleth them in the service of God, and bring∣eth them to a luke-warme temper in the true Religion. At this the Prophet Elijah is exceedingly moved, and put out of all patience: his fiery spirit carrieth him first to Ahab, whom he thus charmeth; It is not I, but thou and thy fathers house that have troubled Israel, because yee have followed Baa∣lim: after up to Mount Carmel, where meeting with a Parliament of all Israel, hee thus abruptly and boldly setteth upon them: How long halt yee between two opinions? Every word hath his spirit and accent: How long? and halt ye? and between two opinions? It is a foule imperfection to halt, and yet more shamefull long to halt, most of all between two waies, and misse them both. To be inconstant in civill affaires, which are in their own nature inconstant, is weaknesse: but in Religion, which is alwayes constant and one and the selfe same, to be unsettled, is (as I proved to you heretofore) the greatest folly in the world. For he who is not assured of one Religion, is sure to be saved by none. Yet as massie bodies have some quaverings and trepidations before they fixe and settle themselves, so the most resolved and established Christian hath a time before hee rest unmoveable in the foundations of the true Religion; but he is not long in this motion of trepi∣dation, he is not altogether liable to this reproofe of Elijah, How long halt yee between two opinions? Halting between two opinions may be (as I then ex∣emplified unto you) two maner of waies, either by limping in a middle way betwixt both, or by often crossing waies, and going sometimes in one way, sometimes in another. Against these two strong holds of Sathan the Prophet Elijah setteth a dilemma, as it were an iron ramme with two hornes; with the one hee bat∣tereth down the one, and with the other the other. If the Lord be God, then are ye not to stay or halt as ye do between two religions, but speedily and resolutely to follow him, and embrace his true worship; but if yee can har∣bour such a thought, as that Baal should be God, then go after him. Either Jehovah is God, or Baal is he, as ye all agree; whether of the two be, it is certaine neither of them liketh of halting followers. If God be the Sove∣raigne of the whole world, why bow ye the knee to Baal? if Baal be hee, why make yee supplications to God? why enquire yee of his Prophets? What Lord soever be God, he is to be followed: if the Lord be he, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.
I hold it needlesse to make any curious enquiry into the names or rites of this Idoll; that which way suffice for the understanding of this and o∣ther Texts of Scripture, I find that Baal was the abomination of the Sido∣nians, a people of Phoenicia, who (asEx Rainold. de Rom. Eccles. Idolatr. l. 2. Sanchoniacho an ancient writer of that country, and Herodian a later Romane Historian affirme) worship∣ped the Sunne, invocating him Beel, or Baal-Samen, that is in their lan∣guage, Lord of Heaven. Though this Idoll were but one, yet in regard of the divers Images set up to it in divers places, we reade of Baalim, & Baal-Peor, and Baal-Zebub; just (saith Ribera the Jesuit) as the Blessed Vir∣gin, though she be but one, yet she is called by divers names, taken from the places where her Images are erected, as namely, she is called sometimes Lady of Loretto, sometimes of Monte serato, sometimes of Hayles. But before I come to parallel the Papists and the Baalites, give us leave, rightThe Lord Wotton extra∣ordinary Em∣bassador, and the Lieger Sir Thomas Edmonds. Honourable, who are Embassadors for Christ, to endeavour to imi∣tate that vertue which is most eminent in men of your place, I meane cou∣rage and liberty, to deliver what wee have in commission from our Lord and Master. Yee will say, what need this preface? what doth this Text concerne any here? though it be set upon the tenter hookes never so long, it cannot reach to any Christian congregation. It were ignorance and im∣pudency to affirme, that any who have given their names to Christ halt be∣tween God and Baal, or offer incense to the Sunne. I hope I may excuse all here present from the sin of the Baalites, & I would I could also all others, who professe themselves Christians; but that I cannot doe, so long as the whoredomes of the Romish Jezebel are as evident as the Sunne-beames, which the Baalites worshipped. I find not in Scripture Idolaters branded chiefly because they were Baalites, but Baalites because they were Idola∣ters. If then any who beare the name of Christians may bee justly charged with idolatry, they fall under the sharp edge of this reproofe in my Text, as also do all those who are not yet resolved which Religion to stick unto, the Romish or the Reformed. Now before we lay Idolatry to the charge of the Romish Church, it will be requisite to distinguish of a double kind of Idolatry or Superstition. 1. When religious worship is given to a false god, which is forbidden in the first precept of the Decalogue. 2. When a false or irreligious worship is given to the true God, which is forbidden in the second Commandement. With Idolatry in the first sense we charge them not; for they receiving with us the Apostles Creed, worship one God in Trinity with us: but from Idolatry in the second acception they can never cleere themselves, but by changing their tenets, and reforming their practice. For every will-wor∣ship, or worship devised by man against or besides Gods commandement, is a false worship: and what is Popery almost else but an addition of humane traditions to Gods commandements & his pure worship? What is their of∣fering of Christ in the Masse for a propitiatory sacrifice for the living and the dead? their elevation of the host? their carrying it in solemne Proces∣sion? their dedicating a feast to it, called Corpus Christi day? What are their benedictions of oyle, salt, and spittle, christening of Bells and Gal∣lies? What are their invocation of Saints, Dirges, and Requiems for the
dead? going in pilgrimages to the Images and Reliques of Saints and Mar∣tyrs, but religious, or rather irreligious rites brought in by the Church without any command or warrant from Gods Word? Secondly, other learned Divines distinguish Idolatry into 1. Crassam, a grosse or palpable kind of Idolatry, when the creature it selfe is worshipped in or for it selfe. 2. Subtilem, a subtle and more cunning kind of Idolatry, when the creature is denied to bee worshipped, but God in, by, and through it. For as the same wooll may be spunne with a courser or with a finer thread, so the same sinne specie may bee committed after a grosser or more subtle manner. As for example: hee may be said to commit grosse murder, who cuts a mans throat, or chops off his head, or runneth him through the heart, and not he who poysoneth his broth, or his gloves, or his spurres, or his saddle; and yet the latter is as guilty of murder before God as the former. In like manner, hee who defileth corporally the body of his neighbours wife, may be said to commit grosse adultery, yet hee is not free from that foule crime, who lusteth after a woman in his heart, though he commit not the foule act; so wee may say, that hee who robbeth a man upon the high∣way, or cutteth his purse in a throng, committeth grosse theft; yet cer∣tainly he that cheateth or couzeneth a man of his mony, is as well a breaker of the eighth commandement as the former: The same we are to conceive concerning Idolatry forbidden in the second commandement. For whether it be crassa or subtilis, a worship of the creature it selfe, or a pretended wor∣ship of God in or by the creature, it is odious and abominable in the sight of God. For the people that worshipped the golden Calfe made by Aaron, and the ten Tribes which worshipped the Calves set up by Jeroboam, wor∣shipped the true God in and by those Images. For Aaron, when hee saw the golden Calfe, built an Altar before it, & made a Proclamation, To mor∣row is a feast Jehovae, to the Lord. And Jeroboam (as Josephus testifieth) appointed not that the Calves that hee set up in Dan and Bethel should be adored as gods, sed ut in Vitulis Deus coleretur; but that God should bee worshipped in and by those Calves. Nay the Baalites, who were esteemed grosser Idolaters than the other, had this plea for themselves, that under the name of Baal-Samen, the Lord of Heaven, they worshipped the true God, as may be more than probably gathered out of the words of God by the ProphetHos. 2.16. Hosea, And it shall bee in that day (saith the Lord) that thou shalt call mee Ishi, my husband, and shalt call mee no more Baal: for I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall bee no more remem∣bred by their name. Yet the Scripture stileth these Idolaters:1. Cor. 10.7. Neither bee yee idolaters, as were some of them, as it is written, The people sate downe to eate and drinke, and rose up to play. And God proceedeth against them, as if they were grosse Idolaters: for Moses tooke theExod. 32.20.27. Calfe which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and grownd it to powder, and strawed i upon the water, and made the children of Israel drinke of it. And he said to the sons of Levi, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side,
and goe in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. Nei∣ther did the ten Tribes after, or the Baalites escape better: for the Kings of Israel were plagued for their Idolatry, and all the people led into capti∣vity. And for the Baalites, they were slaine with a sword, and the Temple of Baal made a Jakes. Here I would not bee mistaken, as if I put no difference between an Heathen and a Papist, an Hereticke and an Infidell. For although the Papists in their transcendent charity exclude Protestants out of all pos∣sibility of salvation,See Wright his motives, That Protestants have no faith, no God, no re∣ligion. Fisher his Treat. Out of the Romish Church no sal∣vation. Bellar. apol. 8. Jacobus quia Catholicus non est, Chri∣stianus non est. W.B. his dis∣course entitu∣led the Non entitie of Pro∣testants religi∣on. deny them to have any Church, any faith, any hope of salvation, any interest in Christ, any part in God; yet wee have learned from the Apostle to render to no man evill for evill, nor rebuke for rebuke, nor slander for slander: wee deny them not to have a Church, though very corrupt and unsound; wee doubt not but through Gods mercy many thousands of our fore-fathers, who lived and dyed in the communion of their Church, and according to that measure of knowledge which was revealed unto them out of holy Scripture in the mysteries of salvation, led a godly and inno∣cent life, not holding any errour against their conscience, nor allow∣ing themselves in any knowne sinne, continually asking pardon for their negligences and ignorances of God, through Christs merits, might bee saved, though not as Papists, that is, not by their Popish addi∣tions and superstitions, but as Protestants, that is, by those common grounds of Christianity which they hold with us. All that I intend to shew herein is, that in some practices of theirs, they may bee rightly compared to the Heathen: as when the Apostle saith, that he that provideth not for his owne family is worse than an Infidell, his meaning is not, that every Christian that is a carelesse housholder, is simply in worse state than a Heathen; but onely by way of aggrava∣tion of that sinne, hee teacheth all unthrifts that in that particular they are more culpable than Heathen: In like manner my meaning is not to put Papists and Heathen in the same state and ranke, as if there were not more hope of a Papist than a Painims salvation; but to breed a greater loathing and detestation of Popish idolatry and superstition, by paralleling Baalites and other Heathens together, I will make it evidently appeare, that some particular practices of the Romane Church are no better than Heathenish.See Hom. a∣gainst the perill of Idolatry, p. 3. Of this mind were they who laid the first stones of the happy reformation in England. Our Image main∣tainers and worshippers have used and use the same outward rites and manner of honouring and worshipping their Images, as the Gen∣tiles did use before their Idols: and that therefore they commit ido∣latry as well inwardly as outwardly, as did the wicked Gentile Ido∣laters. If any reply, that these Homilies were but Sermons of private men tran∣sported with zeale, and carry not with them the authority of the whole Church of England: I answer, that as those Verses of Poets alledged by the Apostle were made part of the Canonicall Scripture by being inser∣ted into his inspired Epistles; so the Homilies, which are mentioned by
name in the 35. Article, and commended as containing godly andHis Maje∣sties declarati∣on: We doe therefore rati∣fie and confrme the said Arti∣cles, which doe containe the doctrine of the Church of Eg∣land, requiring all our loving subjects to con∣tinue in the uniforme pro∣fession thereof, and prohibi∣ting the least difference from the said Arti∣cles. whole∣some doctrine, and necessary for the times, are made part of the Articles of Religion which are established by authority of the whole Convocation, and ratified and confirmed by the royall assent. Were not this the ex∣presse judgement of the Church of England, (whose authority ought to stop the mouth of all that professe themselves to be her children, from any way blaunching the idolatrous practices of the Romane Church) yet were not the fore-heads of our Image-worshippers made of as hard metall as their Images, they would blush to say as they doe, that the testimonies which wee alledge out of Scriptures and Fathers make against Idols, and not against Image-worship. For the words are,Levit. 26.1. Yee shall make no Idoll or graven Images, nor reare up any standing Image, nor set up any Image of stone, to bow downe to it. The words are,Exod. 20 4. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any Pesel, that is, any thing carved or graven: And if there may seem any mist in this generall word to any, the words following cleerly dispell it, Nor the likenesse of any thing that is in heaven above, nor in the earth beneath, nor in the waters under the earth. The third Text is thus rendered in their own vulgar Latine:Deut. 4.15, 16, 17. Take therefore good heed to your soules; for yee saw no man∣ner of similitude in the day which the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire, lest peradventure being deceived,Custodite sollicit ani∣mas vestras, non vidistis aliquam simi∣litudinem in die quâ Domi∣nus vobis lo∣cutus est in Horeb in me∣dio igne, ne fortè faciatis vobis sculp∣tam imagi∣nem, vel simi∣litudinem mas∣culi vel foemi∣nae. ye make you a graven I∣mage, the similitude of any figure, the likenesse of male or female, the likenesse of any beast that is on the earth, the likenesse of any winged fowle that flyeth in the aire, the likenesse of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likenesse of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth. Neither is our allegation out of the Prophet Esay lesse poignant than the former: To whom willEsay 40.18, 19, 20. ye liken God? or what likenesse will yee compare unto him? The workman mel∣teth a graven Image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and ca∣steth silver chaines. Hee that is so impoverished that hee hath no oblation, chooseth a tree that will not rot; hee seeketh unto him a cunning workman, to prepare a graven Image, &c. As tor the words Imago and Idolum, if wee respect the originall, they are all one: for  is derived from , signi∣fying the shape or species of any thing: and therefore not onely Aristotle calleth the shapes of things, which are received into our senses, the idols of the senses, but CardinallCom. in c. 20. Exod. Cajetan also the images of the Angels in the Arke, Idola Cherubinorum. If wee regard the most common use of the words, they differ as mulier and scortum, that is, a woman and a strumpet. For as a woman abused or defiled by corporall fornication, is called a strumpet; so all such Images as are abused to spirituall fornication are cal∣led Idols. Thus SaintLib. 8. de orig. c. 11. Ido∣lum est simu∣lachrum, quod humanâ effi∣gie est conse∣craum. Isidore defineth an Idoll: An Idoll is an Image con∣secrated in an humane shape. And at the first all Idols were such, but after men fell into grosser idolatry, and turned the glory of God not only into the similitude of aRom. 1.23, 24. corruptible man, but also of beasts, and fowles, and creeping things. The difference which Cardinall Bellarmine maketh between an Image and an Idoll (viz.) that an Idoll is the representation of that which hath no existence in nature; but an Image the likenesse of something really existent, is false, and repugnant to Scripture. For the Cherubims in the Ake were Images, yet never was there any thing in nature existent in such a forme as they were expressed, viz. in the face of a childe with six wings.
And no man doubteth, but that the Image which Aaron made, the Nehu∣stan which Hezekiah brake downe, Bell and the Dragon, Rempham, Baal, and Dagon were Idols, and the worshippers of them Idolaters: yet were these figures the representations of things existent in nature, viz. of a King, a Beast, a Serpent, a Starre, the Sunne, and a Fish: and therefore what arguments the ancient Fathers, Origen, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Minu∣tius Felix use against the Heathenish Idols, will serve as strong weapons to knocke downe and batter in pieces all Popish Images. What aDivin instit. l. 2. c. 2. Quae igitur amentia est aut ea fin∣gere quae ipsi postmodum timeant, aut timere quae finxerint?

If yee worship the Images for themselves, yee are more senslesse and blockish than they: for they if they had life and sense as ye have, would not suffer you to worship them, but themselves would fall downe and worship you their makers. But if, as some will colour the matter, yee worship not the Image but God by the Image, why then lift yee not up your eyes to heaven, where yee know God sitteth in his majesty? why cast yee them downe? why in offering up your prayers to him turne yee to a carved stone or painted post? The use of an Image is, to pre∣serve the memory of those that are dead or absent: therefore sith God is al∣waies alive and present with us, his image is alwaies superfluous. And in our devotion to turne to it is all one, as if a man in the presence of his friend, or a servant in the presence of his master, having a message to deliver to him-should turne from him and tell a tale to his picture. And is it not a strange thing that sottish men should performe such a deale of respect and ceremony to the image? bow downe before it, bring presents, and burne incense to it, and yet all this while make no reckoning at all of the goldsmith, whose creature it is? Questionlesse there can bee noOrig lil 8 cont. Celsum.

Is not man himselfe made after Gods image? what an incon∣gruity then were it for man to thinke of making or dedicating any other image to God, who is it himselfe? What abjectnesse and basenesse is it for him who beareth the image of the living God, to cast himselfe downe before, and adore the images of dead men and women? We reade of a bar∣barous and savage act of a cruell tyrant, who bound living men to dead car∣kasses, till the one corrupted the other, and both rotted together. Is not the cruelty of those Heathen Emperours as barbarous, who perforce cou∣ple the living images of God, the soules of men to dead images, to corrupt them thereby? Which of these battell-axes is not as serviceable altoge∣ther to knocke downe Popish Images, as to maule and deface Heathe∣nish Idols? And this may suffice for the paralleling of Baalites and Papists in generall, as they are Idolaters: let us now compare them in speciall.
1. As the Papists plead for themselves, that they worship not Idols, that is, the representation of things feigned, and devised by man, but ima∣ges of things truly existent; so the Baalites might varnish over their idola∣try, saying, that the image they worshipped was not of any feigned deity, but of that which all men and women saw, which was not only visible, but also most glorious, to wit, the Sunne. 2. As the Baalites stood upon the multitude of Baals worshippers and ministers: For to one Priest or Prophet of God that durst shew his head, they had above foure hundred that followed the Court, and had their table there, (& albeit indeed there were more than seven thousand in Israel that never bowed the knee to Baal: yet these played least in sight, and there were more than seventy times seven thousand in all Israel, that for ought ap∣peares, either willingly or by constraint bowed to him) in like manner the Papists at this day brag of nothing so much, as of the multitude of their professours, and paucitie or latencie of those, especially in former ages, that professed the reformed religion, or impugned the Roman faith. 3. As the priests of Baal called him Baal Samen, King or Lord of hea∣ven, so doe the superstitious Papists call the blessed Virgin the Queene of heaven. 4. As the Baalites erected divers images to Baal, which received names from the places where they stood, as Bal Peor, Baal Zephon, Baal Tamar; so have the Papists erected divers images to our Lady, which they in like manner denominate from the cities where they are set up, as the Lady of Loretto, the Lady of Sichem, the Lady of Mount Seratto, the Lady of Hailes, Nostre Dame de Paris, de Rouen, &c. 5. As the servitours of Baal were distinguished into ordinary Priests and Chemarims, who were a peculiar order differing from the rest by their blacke habit: so the Romish Clergie is evidently divided into ordinary Priests, and Monks, and Jesuites, whose coat is of the same colour with Baals Chemarims. 6. As the Priests of Baal used vaine repetitions of the name of their God in their prayers, crying, O Baal heare us, Baal heare us, &c. so doe Pa∣pists in their Jesus and Ladies Psalters much more often repeat the name of Jesus and our Lady, and, which I never read of the Baa∣lites, they put a kind of religion in the number. For yee shall reade in the Churches as yee passe by, many hundred, nay thousand yeeres of pardons liberally offered to all that devoutly say over so many Pater nosters or Ave Maries before such an Altar or Picture. 7. As the Priests of Baal used many strange gestures at their Altars, mentioned ver. 26. so doe these at theirs, and some more ridiculous than those of the Baalites. 8. As the Priests of Baal cut themselves with knives and launcers till the bloud gushed out in great abundance, so these at their solemne proces∣sions whip themselves till they are all bloudy. These things being so, is it possible that there should be any that have given their names to Christ, and partake with us in the mysteries of salvation, and seed at our Lords board, should yet bow the knee to the Romish Baal, and so fall within the stroake of Elijahs reproofe,
How long halt yee between two opinions? Should wee not much wrong our reformed Church, to surmise there should be any of her members subject to the infirmity, or rather deformity of the Israelites here taxed by the Prophet? Had they no meanes this sixty yeeres to strengthen the sinewes of their faith, and cure their halting? Are there any that follow Baalim, or, to speake more properly, insist in the steps of Balaam, and for the wages of unrighteousnesse will as much as in them lyeth curse those whom God hath blessed? Are there any that lispe in the language of Canaan, and speake plaine in the language of Ashdod? frame and maintaine such opinions and tenets, as like the ancient Tragedian Buskin (which served indifferently for either foot, left as well as right) so these, as passable in Rome as Geneva? If there be any such, I need not apply to them this reprehension of my Prophet, How long halt yee between two opini∣ons? The dumbe beast, and used to the yoke, hath long agoe reproved the mad∣nesse of such Prophets. But I would that this larum of Elijah still rung in the eare of some of our great Statists,About this time Doctor Carier, who came over Chaplaine with the Lord Wot∣ton, preached a scandalous Sermon in Pa∣ris at Luxen∣burg house, and not long after reconciled him∣selfe to the Ro∣mish Church, and miscarry∣ing first in his religion, & af∣ter in his hope of great prefer∣ments by the Cardinall Pe∣rons meanes, in great dis∣content ended his wretched dayes. who in the height of their policy over∣reach their Religion, and keep it so in awe, that it shall not quatch against any of their projects for the raising their fortunes, or put them to any trou∣ble, danger, or inconvenience. For as the Heliotropium turneth alwayes to the Sunne, so they their opinions and practice in matter of Religion to the prevalent faction in State. As the cunning Artizan in Macrobius, about the time of the civill warre between Anthony and Augustus Caesar, had two Crowes, and with great labour and industry he taught one of them to say, Salve Antoni Imperator, God save Emperour Anthony: and the other, Salve Auguste Imperator, All haile my Liege Augustus; and thereby how∣soever the world went, he had a bird for the Conquerour: so these, if the reformed Religion prevaile, their birds note is, Ave Christe, spes unica: but if Popery be like to get the upper hand, they have a bird then that can sing, Ave Maria. Strange it is hat in the cleare light of the Gospel wee should see so many Batts flying, which a man cannot tell what to make of, whether birds or mice. They are Zoophytes, plant-animals, like the won∣derfull sheep in Muscovie, Epicens, amphibia animalia, creatures that some∣times live in the water, and sometimes on the land, monsters bred of un∣lawfull conjunctions, which should not see light. If the image of this vice be so horrid and odious in nature, what shall wee judge of the vice it selfe in religion? I am sure God can better away with any sort of sinners than these: for these he threatneth to spew out of his mouth. To close up all. My Beloved, as yee tender the salvation of body and soule, take heed of this Laodicean temper in religion; if ye ever looke to be saved by your religion, yee must save and preserve it entire and unmixed. Take heed how ye familiarly converse with the Priests and Chemarims of Baal, lest they draw you away from the living God to dumb & dead Idols. By no meanes bee brought to bow the knee to Baal, or give any shew or countenance to idolatrous worship: for God is a jealous God, and will not give any part of his glory to graven Images. Now the Lord, who of his infinite mercy hath vouchsafed unto us the liberty of the Gospel, and free preaching of his Word, give a speciall blessing to that portion which hath been delivered to us at this present; plant hee the true Religion in our
hearts, and daily water it both by hearing and reading his Word, and meditating thereupon, that it may bring forth plentifull fruit of righte∣ousnesse in us all; strengthen he the sinewes of our faith, that we never halt between two opinions; enflame he our zeale, that we be never cold or lukewarme in the truth: but in our understanding being rightly enfor∣med and fully resolved of the orthodoxe faith, we may in the whole course of our life be conformed to it, reformed by it, zealous for it, and constant in it to death, and so receive the crowne of life through Jesus Christ. Cui cum Patre, & Spiritu sancto, &c. Amen.
Ambodexters Ambosinisters: Or, One God, one true Religion. THE LIX. SERMON. 1 KIN. 18.21. If the Lord be God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. Right Honourable, &c. NOt to suspect your memorie, or wrong your patience, by any needlesse repetition of what hath beene former∣ly observed out of the whole text joyntly, or the parts severally considered: the drift of the Prophet Elijah in this sprightly reproofe, is to excite the King, No∣bles and Commons of Israel to resolution and zeale, in the true and only worship of the true and only God; and agreeably to this his maine scope and end, hee bendeth all his strength and forces against those vices that bid battaile, as it were, to the former vertues. These are two: 1. Wavering unsettlednesse opposite to resolution. 2. Timorous luke-warmnesse the sworne enemie to zeale. To displace and utterly overthrow them, and establish the contrarie ver∣tues in the soule of every faithfull Israelite, is the direct intent of the Pro∣phet: yet if we consider the assembly before whom he spake, and the fact ensuing upon it, viz. the putting Baals priests to the sword, wee shall clearely perceive by the analogie, which is between the state of the whole body politique and the members thereof, that this text may be applyed to the decision of that great question now in agitation, in this and other Kingdomes, concerning the toleration of divers religions in the same State. For as a private Christian then halteth in judgement, when hee wa∣vereth betweene two religions, uncertaine which to adhere unto: so the whole body of the Common-wealth then seemeth to halt betweene two opinions, when either no religion is by authoritie established, or divers
publikely allowed. Besides yee have here in the event ensuing, upon a mo∣tion made by the Prophet Elijah, a notable example to encourage all zea∣lous Magistrates and Ministers in a good cause, how potent soever the op∣position be. The state of true religion was at this time most deplorate, and almost desperate in Israel; the Prophets and men of God were slaine, and their ensignes and streamers coloured with their bloud, the greatest part of the common souldiers fled treacherously to the enemy: yet when Religion was even now driven out of the field, God taketh part with her, and miracu∣lously giveth her the victory over foure hundred and fifty Priests of Baal, all slaine by the people at the command of Elijah. Toleration of divers religions falleth within the compasse of the myste∣ries of State, which are fitter to be debated at the Councell Table, than de∣termined in the Schooles or Pulpit. I therefore leave it, giving only this premonition, that in a deliberation of this nature, the reverend Prelates of the Church are to be of the Quorum. For first it is to be enquired, whether bearing with a false religion be a thing justifiable by the rules of true re∣ligion, and whether in any case God dispense with tolerating those that worship him otherwise than he hath appointed in his Word; and it being resolved in case of conscience that some kind of toleration is lawfull for some time to prevent a greater mischiefe, the Councell of State may then securely enquire, whether the condition of the present state be such, that the onely meanes to suppresse errours and idolatry, is for a while to connive at them. They are also seriously to consider whether the cockle and darnell be sowne so thicke and spread so farre, that it cannot bee weeded out without the spoile of much good corne. If the Grecians never undertooke any matter of great consequence, before they received answers from their Oracles: neither the Jewes, before they con∣sulted with God by the Ephod: nor the Romans, before they had the approbation of their Soothsayers; doubtlesse all Christian estates are to expect either a command, or at least a warrant from Scrip∣ture, before they proceed in matters so neerly concerning God and his service: otherwise they goe about to set the Sunne-diall by their watch, not their watch by their Sunne-diall; to alter the house to the hangings, not the hangings to the house: whereas all wise Go∣vernours, like good Pilots, have manum ad clavum, & oculos ad astra, their eye upon the starres, and their hand upon the helme, stearing their course below, by direction from above. But because it bet∣ter sorteth with my profession to handle states of controversies, than controversie of State, I will rather apply this reproofe of Eli∣jah, to deterre all that travell in these parts from that dangerous evill and mischiefe, into which many fall, by seeing the free exercise of two contrary religions, to wit, either indifferency, or flat Atheisme. For thus the Devill worketh upon advantage: The Popish religion is idolatry, as the Protestants demonstrate; The Protestants religion is schisme and heresie, as the Papists teach: therefore you may chuse ei∣ther, or neither. The Papists refute the Protestants arguments, and the Protestants the Papists: therefore there is but probality, no certainty either way. This Text may serve for an antidote against this Laodicean
temper. As there is but one God, so there can bee but one true religion: either the Reformed Church must be in the right, or the Romane; there∣fore no halting between both. Beware therefore, deare brethren, of the a∣gents of Rome, who goe about to withdraw you from the love of your Country, your allegiance to your Prince, and which is worst of all, from the true and pure worship of God. If stealing away the bodies of your sonnes and daughters be so hainous a crime, that many conceive it better to deserve the gallowes, than stealing of a horse or sheep, what punish∣ment doe you suppose doe they deserve, who steale away their soules from God, and their hearts from you? If you account them as capitall ene∣mies who seek the ruine of your estate, can you esteem otherwise of them, who seek the utter ruine and overthrow of your soules?Nat. hist. l. 8. c. 59. Quaedam animalia in∣digenis inno∣xia, advenas interimunt; fi∣cut serpentes parvi in Ty∣rinthe, item in Syria an∣gues, circa Euphratis ri∣pas, Syros non attingunt, aut si momorde∣rint, non sen∣tiuntur male∣ficia, aliis cu∣jusque gentis infesti avidè & cum cruciatu exammantes. Pliny writeth of certaine Serpents in Tyrinth, and Snakes in Syria, which never touch the inhabitants, or if they bite them, never hurt them, but sting foreiners in such sort, that they put them to insufferable paine, and greatly endanger their life. It may be some may have such an opinion, that the Priests and Jesuits, and other Papists of their owne country, which they meet withall in these parts, have no will or power to hurt them; and therefore I see many boldly converse with them, because their outward behaviour is faire, and company delightfull: but I beseech them to consider that the Panther hideth her ougly visage, which would terrifie any other beast to come neere her, that shee may the better allure them by the sweet smell of her body; but as soon as they come within her clutches, shee maketh a prey of them. Take heed how ye enter into the house of Rimmon; ye cannot be present there, but either you must give great offence, or commit a greater: give great offence if yee doe not as they doe, or commit a greater if yee joyne with them in their superstitious rites. The Corinthians might not be partakers of such meats as were offered to idols: may wee be partakers of such prayers as are offered to them? It was unlawfull for them to sit at the same table with idolaters when they kept their solemne feast: can it be lawfull for us to stand at the same Altar with them? Beloved, thinke againe and againe upon those fearfull menaces,Apoc. 14.9. If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive the marke in his fore-head or in his hand, the same shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, and hee shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy Angels, and before the Lamb: and the smoak of their torments shall ascend for ever. And they shall have no rest day nor night, which worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the print of his name. I dare boldly say that none of you, my Beloved, have received any print of the beast; yee are yet free from the least suspition of familiarity with the Whore of Babylon, yee have kept your selves unspotted of Po∣pery: wherefore as yee tender your honour and reputation, nay the salva∣tion of your bodies and soules, keep your selves still from Idols: be zea∣lous for Gods honour, and hee will bee zealous for your safety: abstaine from all appearance of that evill, which the spirit of God ranketh with sorcery and witch-craft. If in your travels you chance to see the heathe∣nish superstitions, and abominable idolatries of the Roman Church, make this profitable use thereof; let it incite you to compassionate the blindnesse and ignorance of so many silly soules nuzzled in superstition, who verifie
the speech of the Psalmist,Psal. 115.8. They that worship idols are like unto them, they have eyes and see not the wonderfull things of Gods Law, they have eares and heare not the word of life, they have hands and handle not the seales of grace, they have feet and walke not in the wayes of Gods commandements. What a lamentable thing is it, to see the living image of God to fall downe before a dead and dumb picture? for men endued with sense and reason, to worship unreasonable and senslesse metall? wise men to askeHosea 4.12. My people aske counsel at their stocks, & their staffe teacheth them: for the spirit of whore∣dome hath cau∣sed them to erre, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. counsell of stocks and stones? for them who in regard of their soules are nobly de∣scended from Heaven, to doe homage and performe religious services and devotions to the vilest and basest creatures upon the earth, yea to dust and rottennesse? How much are wee bound to render perpetuall thanks to God, who hath opened our eyes that wee see the grossnesse of their super∣stition, and hath presented unto us a lively image of himselfe, drawne to the life in holy Scripture, an image which to looke upon is not curiositie, but dutie: to embrace not spirituall uncleannesse, but holy love: to adore not idolatrie, but religion: to invocate not superstition, but pietie! If the Lord be God, follow him. Turne we the Rhetoricke of this text in∣to Logicke, and the Dilemma consisting of two suppositions into two do∣ctrinall positions, the points which I am to cleare to your understanding, and presse upon your religious affections, will be these: 1. That there is but one true God: either the Lord or Baal, not both. 2. That this one true God is alone to be worshipped: either Baal must be followed or Jehovah, not both. But the Prophet will prove by miracle and the evidence of fire, that Baal is not God, nor to be worshipped; the con∣clusion is therefore, that Jehovah the God of Israel is the onely true God, and he alone to be worshipped. That there is but one true God, is one of the first principles which all Christians are catechized in: the Decalogue, Lords prayer, and Creed, all three begin with one God, to teach us, 1. Religious worship of one God. 2. Zealous devotion to one God. 3. Assured confidence in one God. At our first Metriculation (if I may so speake) into the Universitie of Christs Catholique Church, wee are required to subscribe to these three prime verities, 1. That there is a Deitie 1. Above all. 2. Over all. 3. In all. 2. That this Deitie is one. 3. That in this Unitie there is a Trinitie of persons. We acknowledge 1. A Deitie against all Atheists. 2. The Unitie of this Deitie against all Paynims. 3. A Trinitie in this Unitie against all Jewes, Mahu∣metans, and Heretiques. Through the whole old Testament this one note is sounded by everie voyce in the Quire. We heare it in the Law: Heare O Israel, the Lord our God isDeut. 6.4. one Lord. We heare it in the Psalmes:Psal. 18.31. Who is God but the Lord? We heare it in the Prophets:Hosea 13.4. Thou shalt know no God but mee; for there is
no Saviour besides me: and,Mal. 2.10.Have we not all one father? hath one not God created us? The new Testament is as an eccho resounding the same note;Ephes. 4.5, 6. 1 Tim. 2.5. One Lord, one faith, one baptisme. One God and father of all, who is above all, and through you all, and in you all. For there is one God, and one Mediatour between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. And, This isJohn 17.3. life eternall to know thee the only true God, and whom thou hast sent Jesus Christ. For although we readGen. 1.1. Elo∣him, as if ye would say Gods in the plurall number, yet the verb Bara is in the singular number, to signifie the Trinitie in the Unitie: & howsoever we find the LordGen. 19.24. rained upon Sodome & Gomorrah brimstone & fire from the Lord out of heaven: and likewise in the Psalmes,Psal. 110.1. The Lord said to my Lord: yet S. Athanasius in his Creed resolveth us, there are not more Gods, or more Lords, nor more eternals, nor more incomprehensibles, but one eternall and one in comprehensible. In the mysterie of the Trinitie there is alius and alius, not aliud and aliud: on the contrarie, in the mysterie of the incarna∣tion of our Lord and Saviour, there is not alius and alius, but aliud and a∣liud; in the one diversity of persons in one nature, in the other diversity of natures in one person.Sol quasi so∣lus. God is, as Plato stileth him, the Sunne of the invisi∣ble world: and it is as cleare to the eye of reason that there is one God, as to the eye of sense that there is one Sunne: for God must be sovereigne, and there cannot be more sovereignes. The principles of Metaphysick laid to∣gether demonstrate this truth after this manner; There is an infinite di∣stance betweene something and nothing: therefore the power which brin∣geth them together, and maketh something, nay all things of nothing, must needs be infinite: but there cannot be more infinite powers, because either one of them should include the other, and so the included must needs bee finite; or not extend to the other, and so it selfe not be infinite. Out of naturall Philosophie such an argument is framed; Whatsoever is either hath a cause of its being, or not: if it hath a cause of its being, it cannot be the first cause; if it have no cause of its being, it must needs bee the cause of all causes. For there cannot be an infinite processe from causes to causes, which nature abhorres; therefore wee must needs come to one first cause that setteth all on working, and it selfe dependeth upon no other former cause. This truth the Poets fitly resembled by a golden chaine upon which heaven and earth hang, whose uppermost linke was fastened to Ju∣piters chaire. The morall Philosophers also yeeld a supply of their forces to aid this truth. There can be but one chiefe good (say they) which wee desire for it selfe, and all other things for it; but this must needs be God: because nothing but the Deitie can satisfie the desire of the reasonable soule, and because in the highest and chiefest of all good, there must needs be an infinitie of good, otherwise we might conceive a better and more desirable good; now no infinite good can be conceived but God. Neither is it a weake pillar wherewith the Statesman supporteth this truth, Nulla fides regni sociis, omnisque potestas Impatiens consortis erit. No one Kingdome can stand, where there are twoBod. de rep. l. 2. c. 20. De vnius domina∣tu. supreme and uncon∣trollable
commanders: therefore neither can the whole world, which is a great Empire or Kingdome, be governed by two or more supreme Mo∣narchs. This argument may be illustrated by the fact and apophthegme of the Grand Seignior, who when his sonne Mustaphas returning from Persia was received and entertained with great shouts and acclamations of all the people, he commanded him presently to be slaine before him, & this oracle to be pronounced by the Priest; Unus in coelo Deus, unus in terris Sultanus: One God in heaven, one Sultan on the earth.Lact. divin. institut. l. 1. c. 5 Adeo in unitatem uni∣versa natura consentit. Lactantius also harpeth upon this string, There cannot be many masters in one family, many Pilots in one ship, many Generalls in one armie, many Kings in one Realme,De Ira Dei, cap. 11. Non possunt in hoc mundo multi esse rectores, nec in una do∣mo multi Do∣mini, nec in una nave multi gubernatores, nec in uno regno multi reges, nec in uno mundo multi soles. many sunnes in one firmament, many soules in one body; so the universalitie of things runnes upon an unitie. These and the like congruities induced the greater part of the heathen Sages to assent to this truth. Mercurius Trismgeistus giveth this reason why God hath no proper name, because he is but one, . Orpheus calleth God the one true and first great begotten, because before him nothing was begotten, whose nature because he could not conceive, he saith he was borne of immense aire. . Pythagoras termeth him Animam mundi; and Anaxagoras, Mentem infinitam; Seneca, Rector of the whole world, and God of heaven and all gods. Tully and Plato were confessours of this truth, and Socrates a Mar∣tyr of it: but, Beloved, we need not such witnesses: for we have the testi∣mony of those three that beare record in heaven; of God the father, I am God, and there isEsay 46.9. none other; of God the sonne, this isJohn 17.3. life eternall to know thee to be the only true God, & whom thou hast sent Jesus Christ; of God the holy Ghost, O Lord there is1 Chron. 17.20. none like thee, neither is there any God but thee: there1 Cor. 8.6. is but one God the father, of whom are all things, and wee in him, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. This point is not more cleere in the proofe, than profitable in the use: which, 1. Convinceth the errour of the Manichees, who taught there were two Gods: and of the Tritheites, who worshipped three: and of the Greekes, who multiply their Gods according to the number of their cities: and of the Romans, Qui cum omnibus gentibus dominarentur omnium gentium ser∣vierunt erroribus: who when they had subdued all nations, made them∣selves slaves to the errours of all. There was no starre almost in the skie, no affection in the minde, no flower in the garden, no beast in the field, no thing almost so vile and abject in the world, which some of the Heathen deified not; Omnia colit error humanus praeter eum qui omnia condidit. This Unity of the Trinity inferreth a Trinity of Unity, Viz. 1. Of faith. 2. Baptisme. 3. Charitie. The two former theEphes. 4.5. Apostle inferreth in that verse, wherein hee decli∣neth, : surely there can bee no verity of unity, where there is no unity of verity. If there bee but one God, then the worship of him must needs be the onely true religion; if there bee no name under heaven by which we may be saved, but the name of Jesus Christ,Acts 4.12.
it insueth hereupon, which serveth wonderfully for our everlasting com∣fort, and the terrour and confusion of all Infidels, that onely the Christi∣an can be saved. The Poets fained that the way to heaven was via lactea, a milkie way: but the Scripture teacheth that the only way thither is via sanguinea, not a milkie, but a bloudie way, by the crosse of Christ. 3. From unity of faith and Sacraments there followeth a third unity, to wit, the unity of love. For how can they bee but united in love, who are members of one mysticall body, and quickened by one and the selfe same spirit? The neerest and strongest tie among men is consanguinity: how neare and deare ought then all Christians to bee one to another, who are not only made all of one bloud, as all men and women are; but also are redeemed by one bloud, the bloud of Christ, and participate also of one bloud in the Sacrament? Where the union is or should be firmer, the division is alwayes fowler: how then commeth it to passe, that as in the Church of Corinth one said,1 Cor. 1.12, 13. I am of Paul, another said I am of Apollo, another I am of Cephas: so in our Church one saith, I am of Luther; another, I am of Calvin; another, I am of Zwinglius? Is Christ divided? Is the reformed religion deformed? Is not this a cunning sleight of Satan to divide us one from another, that so he may prevaile against us all, as Horatius did against the Curiatii: the manner whereofDecad. 1. l. 1. Conserus ma∣nibus cum non motus tantum corporum agi∣tatioque an∣ceps telorum armorumque, sed vulnera quoque & san∣guis spectaculo essent duo Ro∣mani, super a∣lium alius vul∣nerati, tribus Albanis expi∣rantes corrue∣runt, ad quorū casum cum conclamasset gaudio Alba∣nus exercitus, Romanas legi∣ones jam spes tota nondum tamen cura deseruerat, ex∣animes vitae unius quem tres Curiatii circumstete∣rant. Forte is integer fuit, ut universis solus nequaquam par sic adversus singulos ferox, ergo ut segregaret pugnam eorum capessit fugam, ratus secuturos ut quemque vulnere affectum corpus sineret jam aliquantum spatri ex eo loco ubi pugnatum est anfugerat, cum respiciens videt magnis intervallis sequentes unum haud procul ab sese abesse in cum magno impetu rediit. Et dum Albanus exercitus inclamat Curiatiis ut opem ferant fratri, jam Horatius coeso hoste victor secundam pugnam petebat tum clamore qualis ex inspirato faventium solet Romani adjuvant militem suum, & ille defungi proelio festinat prius, itaque quam alter qui nec procul aberat conse∣qui posset, & alterum Curiatium confixit, jamque equato marte singuli supererant: sed nec spe, nec viribus pares male sustinenti arma gladium supernè jugulo defigit, jacentem spoliat. Livie describeth at large, it being a∣greed by both armies of the Romans and the Albans, for the sparing of much bloud-shed, to put the triall of all to the issue of a battaile between six bre∣thren, three on the one side the sonnes of Curatius, and three on the other side the sonnes of Horatius: While the Curatii were united, though they were all three sorely wounded, they killed two of the Horatii; the third remaining, though not hurt at all, yet finding himselfe not able to make his partie good a∣gainst all three, begins to take his heeles, and when hee saw them follow him slowly one after the other, as they were able, by reason of their heavie armour and sore wounds: hee fals upon them one after another, and slayes them all three. When Cyrus came neare Babylon with his great army, and finding the river about it, over which he must passe, so deepe, that it was impossi∣ble to transport his army that way, he suddenly caused it to be divided in∣to many channels, whereby the maine river sunke so on the sudden, that with great facilitie hee passed it over and tooke the citie. That maxime in Philosophy, Omne divisibile est corruptibile, holds in all States & societies. After the Donatists had made a faction in Affrica, as they brake the unity of the Church, so they were broken themselves into divers fractions: and so in a short space came to nothing. The division among the Trojans brought in the Grecians, the divisions among the Grecians brought in Philip, the division of the Assyrian Monarchie brought in the Persian, of the Persian brought in the Macedonian, of the Macedonian brought in the Roman, of the Roman brought in the Turke. Lastly, the division among the Bri∣taines
of this nation, brought in first the Saxons, next the Danes, and last of all the Normans: So true is the axiome of our Saviour, A kingdome di∣vided against it selfe cannot stand. The barbarous Souldiers, beloved Chri∣stians, divided not Christs coat, shall wee rend and teare asunder his body by schisme and faction? The lines, the neerer they come to the center, the neerer they are one to another: we cannot be one with God, so long as we are thus divided one against another. I conclude as the Oratour doth his oration upon the answers of the Soothsayers. When upon the newes of earth-quakes and other prodigious signes, the Soothsayers foretold great calamities were likely to befall the State, unlesse the wrath of the gods were suddenly appeased; the Oratour determineth the point most divine∣ly,Cic. de arusp. resp. Faciles sunt deorum irae; nostrae sunt inter nos irae, discordiae∣que placandae. God will be easily reconciled to us, if we be reconciled one to another. If we be at peace one with another, Beloved, God will soone be at peace with us; and if God be at peace with us, all creatures shall be in league with us, and neither Divell, nor man, neither any thing else shall have any power to hurt us. So be it. Deo Patri, &c.
BLOUDY EDOME. THE LX. SERMON. PSAL. 137.7, 8. 7. Remember, O Lord, the children of Edome, in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it even to the foundation thereof. 8. O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed: happy shall hee be that rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us. Right Honourable, &c. WHat a storme is in the skie, that a vehement passion is in the mind; it darkeneth, it stirreth and troubleth it, and af∣ter fearfull crackes it resolveth in the end into a sad shower: such a violent perturbation seized at this time on the minds of the exiled Jewes in Babylon, when the insolent Conquerours, adding affliction to their afflicti∣on, and gall to their wormwood, in a flouting and jeering manner called for their Hebrew songs and melody in that their heavie and dolefull estate. What so unseasonable as to require a man to sing pleasant songs, when his very heart-strings are broken with griefe? What so la∣mentable and pitifull, as not to be pitied in greatest misery? nay to bee in∣sulted upon and laughed at? Wherefore what with a longing desire of their country, and sorrow for their losse of it: what with zeale for the Lords ho∣nour, and the glory of Sion: what with indignation against such savage and barbarous usage, the people of God over-cast as it were with a blacke and dismall cloud, partly breake out into direfull execrations, like thunder and lightening, ver. 7, 8, 9. partly vent their griefe in sighes, ver. 4, 5, 6. partly resolve it into a shower of teares, ver. 1. Edome is blasted as it were with lightening for her wicked words, ver. 7. and Babylon is struck with a thun∣der-bolt for her cruell deeds against Gods People, City, and Temple, vers. 8, 9. Edome shall be remembred for the mischievous counsell he gave; and the daughter of Babylon shall be for ever razed out of memory, for razing Jerusalem to the ground. And let all the secret and open enemies of Gods
Church take heed how they imploy their tongues and hands against Gods secret ones: they that presume to doe either, may here reade their fatall doome written in the dust of Edome, and ashes of Babylon.Plin. at. hist. l. 21. c 4 Rosa siccis quàm humidis odo∣ratior, omni recisione atque ustione profi∣cit, translatio∣ne quoque o∣cyssimè. Roses lose not their naturall smell by transplantation, but (as Pliny observeth) grow more fragrant thereby. It is so with men, the naturall affection they beare to their country is rather increased than decreased by peregrination; as the sighes which the captive Jewes breathe out in this Psalme, and the plentifull teares which they shed by the waters of Babylon, may be abundant proofes unto us. As they walked in the pleasant fields about Babylon, they thinke of the lamentable estate of their owne Country, and the ruine of their Ci∣ty and Temple, which cast downe their countenance, and drew abundance of teares from their eyes, sighes from their heart, and prayers from their mouth for Babels Babel, that is, the confusion of the Babylonians, who neither spared City nor Temple, but sacked and razed both downe to the ground. This is the ground upon which the Psalmist sweetly runneth through the whole Psalme: wherein foure things are particularly descanted on; 1. The grievous affliction of Gods people, who were banished their na∣tive soyle, and by the waters of Babylon sate downe and wept. 2. The inhumane cruelty of the Babylonians, who not content to banish them out of their native country, endeavoured also to banish all naturall affection out of their mindes, requiring from them light and merry songs in this their great heavinesse. 3. The zealous affection of the people towards their Country. 4. Their effectuall prayer to God against their enemies the Edomites, as the instigators of the siege and sacke of Jerusalem; and the Babylonians as the chiefe actors in that bloudy Tragedy. Remember the children of Edome, &c. We have in these words, 1. A patheticall imprecation. 2. A propheticall denunciation. Edome is accursed, Babylon is sentenced; the one for advising, the other for committing outrage upon Gods people. Nothing will satisfie their malice and cruelty but a glut of bloud, and massacre of Gods Saints, and razing the holy City againe and againe if it were possible to a second foun∣dation. In the patheticall imprecation note we particularly, 1. The curse it selfe, Remember. 2. The parties accursed, The children of Edome. 3. The cause why they are accursed, their words steeped in the gall of malice, Downe with it, downe with it to the ground. Likewise in the prophesie against Babylon observe, 1. Her title, Daughter of Babylon. 2. Her judgement, Which art to be destroyed. 3. Her sin, implyed in those words, As shee hath served us. Remember. Remembrance is the calling to mind of such things as be∣fore we had forgot, or at least put by and laid aside for the present. God therefore, who at once apprehendeth all things past, present and future, can∣not be properly said to remember any thing; yet by a figure he is said to
remember his covenant, when he performeth the conditions on his part: to remember his children, when he rewardeth them for their obedience: and to remember his enemies also when hee repayeth unto them the workes of their hands. The good theefe taketh the Word in the good sense:Luk. 23.42. Lord, remember mee when thou commest into thy Kingdome. And David,Psa. 106.4, 5. Remem∣ber mee, O Lord, with the favour thou bearest thy people: O visit mee with thy salvation, that I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoyce in the glad∣nesse of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. But the Jewes here take the words in the worst sense; Remember the children of Edome, that is, thinke upon them according to their deserts. There is a precious balme that breaketh the head, and the soft drops pierce stones; even so the milde and meeke prayer of Gods people here against their unnaturall bre∣thren the Edomites pierced the heavens, and prevailed with him that is om∣nipotent. God remembred his peoples just complaints, and the Edomites paid for it. Thus if we would remember the words of God,Rom. 12.19. Heb. 10.30. Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord; and when wee are wronged in the highest degree, commit our cause to him, and not to vow, threaten, or practise our owne revenge: God would certainly right us in due time. Are wee not brethren? If then we have hard measure offered unto us, why doe we not complaine to our heavenly Father? Why doe wee not powre out our groanes into his bosome either in the words of Brutus,Plut. in vit. Brut. ? Or rather in the words of David,Psal. 35.1. Plead thou my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with mee, fight against them that fight against mee? Or of the slaine under the Altar,Rev. 6.10. How long, O Lord holy and true, doest thou not judge and avenge our bloud on them that dwell upon the earth? Yea, but ye may object, Is not this Remember here an imprecation or a curse in words as smooth as oyle, and yet in the sense as sharp as swords? What then? may the children of blessing curse? Is not cursing accursed by the Prophet? HisPsal. 10.7. mouth is full of cursing. As he lovedPsal. 109.17. cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighteth not in blessing, so let it be farre from him. Are not curses fitly compared to arrowes shot bolt upright, which fall downe upon the head of him that drawes the bow? Doth not our blessed Savi∣our command us toMat. 5.44. blesse them that curse us? And doth not the Apostle repeat it againe and againe for feare we should forget it,Rom. 12.14. Blesse them that persecute you, blesse (I say) and curse not? Are not cursed speakers sharply censured by the Apostle, and ranked among the greatest sinners?Rom. 3.13, 14. Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues they have used deceit: their mouth is full of cursing and bitternesse, their feet are swift to shed bloud. The resolution of this doubt consisteth in a distinction of the 1. Parties, 1. Cursing. 2. Cursed. 2. Cause. Saint Austine alloweth of no cursing by malediction, but propheticall prediction. Peter Martyr putteth a great difference between cursing, which proceeds from a sense of our private wrong, and that which breakes out of zeale for Gods honour when his name is blasphemed, or his kingdome op∣posed, and truth scandalized. Men (saith he) may not curse carnali affectu,
out of a carnall affection: but it is another thing, cùm aguntur Spiritu Dei; when they are moved thereunto by the Spirit of God. He distinguisheth also of temporall and eternall evills, and he is of opinion, that in some case tempo∣rall evills may be wished to our enemies, because they may turne to their good; but in no wise eternall. Pareus having distinguished of humane im∣precations and divine, and subdivided these either into immediate or me∣diate, determineth, that observing some conditions, wee may without sinne curse some kind of men. What we may safely build upon in this question, I will lay down in three assertions. 1. Men that have the gift of Prophecy may curse the enemies of God and his truth, not only in generall, but also in particular: as David dothPsal. 69.25. Acts 1.20. Judas, PeterAct 8.2, 20. Simon Magus, and Paul the highAct. 23.3. Priest. For this kind of cursing is not properly malediction, but prediction; neither is it spoken voto optanti∣um, sed spiritu prophetantium, as Saint Austine teacheth us to distinguish. 2. Men endued with ecclesiasticall power may pronounce Anathema's, deli∣ver to Sathan, and curse obstinate heretickes and contemners of ecclesiasticall discipline. For this is jus dicere, not maledicere; an act of power, not impo∣tent affection; of censure, not revenge. Howbeit, the Church must be spa∣ring of these thunder-bolts of execration and excommunication, remem∣bring alwayes that this power is2 Cor. 10.8. given to them for edification, not for de∣struction. For it is most true, that the Athenian Priest answered to those that would have had her curse Alcibiades: Priests (saith shee) are appoin∣ted to blesse, not to curse; to pray for people, not against them. Notwith∣standing if the Church meet with a Simon Magus, set in the gall of bitter∣nesse and bond of iniquity: or an Elymas, that will not cease to pervert the right waies of God: or an Alexander that mightily withstandeth the preach∣ing of the Gospel; shee may brandish the sword of the Spirit, and cut such off from her visible assemblies for a time, till they make their peace with God by repentance, and with the Church by confession and humble sub∣mission to her sacred Canons. 3. Men neither inspired by God, nor authorized by the Church, yet may and ought to pray against the kingdome of Sathan and members of Antichrist in generall, and all whosoever stop the free passage of the Gospel, or hinder the advancement of Christs Kingdome. For we cannot love God, but we must needs love them that love him, and hate them that hate him, even with a perfect hatred. As wee must blesse them that blesse him, so wee may and ought in generall to curse all that curse him. In warre wee may aime at the Standard, and shoot at the Flagge and Ensignes; but it is against the law of armes to levell at any particular man: in like manner we may shoot out of zeale fiery darts of execration at the Standard of Sathan, and levell at the Flagge and Colours of Antichrist; but wee may not curse or doome to the pit of hell such a nation, city, assembly, or man in particular. 1. Because God only knoweth who are his: he that is now a great per∣secuter, or a scoffer at the truth, may be in time a zealous professor; and it is a fearfull thing to curse the children of blessing. 2. Because it is very difficult, if not impossible for any in this kinde
to curse, but that malice and desire of revenge will mingle themselves with our zeale, and thereby wee shall offer with Nadab and Abihu strange fire. 3. Because we are commanded to pray for our enemies, who the more they have wronged us, the more they stand in need of our prayers. For the greater injury they offer us, the more they hurt themselves: they wound us in body, but themselves in soule: they spoyle us of our goods, but they deprive themselves of Gods grace: they goe about to staine our good name, but by detraction and false calumniation they worse staine their owne conscience: they may worke us out of favour with Princes and great men, but they put themselves out of favour with God thereby. Yee heare how execrable a thing cursing and execration is, and yet what so common? I tremble to rehearse what wee heare upon every sleight occasion. O remember from this Memento in my Text, that unlesse yee were inspired as the people here were, and knew that those whom yee curse were hated of God, as these Edo∣mites were, by cursing others yee incurre a curse, and by ca∣sting fire-brands of Hell at your brethren, yee heape hot burning coales upon your heads. And so I passe from the curse to the parties cursed: The children of Edome. The Edomites or Idumeans were of the race of Esau, Jacobs elder brother, who comming home hungry from hunting, and finding his brother seething pottage, grew so greedy of it, that he bargai∣ned with him for a messe at the deare rate of his birth-right. This red broth bought at such a price, was ever after cast in Esau his dish, and from it hee was calledGen. 25.30, 31, 32, 33. Edome, and all his posterity Edomites or Idumeans, as if yee would say, red or bloudy ones. Such was their name, and such were they: a bloudy generation, of the right bloud of Esau. For as he sought the life of his brother Jacob, so they ever plotted the ruine and destruction of the Jewes their brethren; and in the day of Jerusalems fearfull visitation, when the Babylonians had taken the City, and put all in it to the sword, and rob∣bed the Temple, and ransacked all the houses, and left nothing but the wall, their unnaturall brethren the Idumeans in stead of quenching, or at least allaying the fury of the Babylonians by their praiers and compassio∣nate teares, cast oyle into the flame, and set them in a greater rage against them, and instigated them to a further degree of cruelty, even to pull down all the houses, and sacke the walls, saying, Raze it, raze it to the ground. For which their inhumane and savage cruelty against the Church of God, God remembred them in due time, and rewarded them as they had served their brethren, to fulfill the prophecies ofJer. 49.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Jeremy and Obadiah:Obad. ver. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. For thy cruelty against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee. In the day that thou stoodest on the other side; in the day that the stranger carried away captive his forces, and forreiners entred into his gates, & cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them. But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger, neither shouldest thou have re∣joyced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction: neither shoul∣dest thou have spoken proudly in the day of their distresse. Neither shouldest
thou have stood in the crosse wayes, to cut off those of his that did escape, neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remaine in the day of di∣stresse. For the day of the Lord is neere upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, so it shall be done unto thee, thy reward shall returne upon thine owne head. Be∣hold a notable example of divine justice in meting to the wicked their owne measure, and punishing them with that where with they offended. The E∣domites proved false to the Jewes their brethren, and their neerest friends prove false to them: They received a wound (ver. 7.) from the men of their confederacy, even from them that ate their bread: Non expectato vulnus ab hoste ferunt. Remember, O Lord, the Edomites, but destroy the Babylonians. Though the Edomites dealt most cruelly with their brethren the Jewes, yet the Jewes are not so farre transported with passion against them, as not to put a difference between them and the Babylonians. By the way wee may note the condition of Christs dearest Spouse in the world: both Edomites and Babylonians, forraine and domesticall enemies, those that are neere, and those that are farre off conspire against poore Jerusalem, and bring her (as you see) upon her knees, crying to heaven for revenge, and by the spirit of prophesie promising Cyrus good successe in his enterprise against Babylon. O daughter of Babylon, that is, City of Babylon, by an elegant Hebra∣isme; as tell the daughter of Sion, that is, tell Sion. We reade of a twofold Ba∣bylon in sacred Scriptures, of the one in the Old Testament, the other in the New: the one proper and materiall, the other figurative & mysticall: the one the seat of Nebuchadnezzar, & the Emperors of Assyria, the other the seat of Antichrist: the on situate by the great river, by whose banks the Israelites sate downe and wept, the other sitting upon many waters, that is, as the Angel expoundeth it, manyApoc. 17.15. peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues: the one keeping the bodies of Gods people, the other their soules in captivity and bondage. This latter not only the ancient Fathers, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Saint Jerome, and Saint Austine, but also the Jesuites themselves, Ribera, Vegas, and Bellarmine put upon the racke, and sorely tortured with the arguments of Protestants, confesse to bee Rome. For the Whore ofApoc. 17.18. Babylon is said to be the great City, which reigneth over the Kings of the earth: and ver. 17. Shee is said to sit upon a beast, having seven heads, which are seven hills, ver. 9. Now there was no City in the world which ruled over the Kings of the earth at that time when St. John wrote but Rome: neither was there any place so famously and generally knowne by any marke as Rome by the seven hills upon which it is built; which is therefore called septi-collis urbs, and her inhabitants in Tertullians time septem collium plebs, and the chiefest feast which they kept in December upon those seven hills, septi-montium. What of all this will some Papists say? let the daughter of Babylon be the mother of fornications, let the speech of SaintAug. l. 18. de civit. Dei, c. 20. Rom altera Baby∣lon, & prioris filia. Ibid. Vives in comment. Hie∣ronym. epist. ad Marcellam. Non aliam existimat describi à Johanne in Apocalypsi Babylonem, quàm urbem Romam. Austine be as true as it is elegant, Babylon quasi prima Ro∣ma, Roma quasi secunda Babylon, what will ensue hereupon? nothing but this, That the Pope is Antichrist. This consequent cannot be avoided by their usuall distinction of ancient and new Rome, Heathenish and Christi∣an, Imperiall and Papall: for Saint John speaketh of Rome in her later time,
when Antichrist should sit in her, when Babylon should fall, and be broken into ten peeces, or kingdomes: which was not fulfilled in the reigne of the Heathen Emperours; and therefore must be accomplished in the reigne of Popes, who are the seventh head of the Beast, that is, the seventh forme of government of that City. Five were fallen in Saint Johns time (viz.) Kings, Consuls, Tribunes, Dictators, Decemvirs: the sixth was upon it (viz.) the head of Emperours; the seventh was to rise up (viz.) the head of Popes. But because ye may suspect, that out of prejudicate opinion against the Pope, we wrest these Sciptures against the See of Rome, I will bring in all my evidence at this time against the Pope out of the writings of the anci∣ent Fathers, who cannot be thought to deprave Scriptures out of an ill af∣fection to Rome. For they then honoured and highly esteemed the Church of Rome, as a principall member of Christs Spouse: yet even then they conceived that she would in time become the Whore of Babylon. For Irenaeus calculating the number of the Beast 666. maketh of it this word, , The name of Latinus (saith he) containeth the number 666. and is very likely to be the name of theIren. l. 5. adv. haer c. 30. Beast: for they are the Latines that now reigne. And Tertullian ghessing at the time of Antichrists rising, saith,Tertul. de resurrect. Romani Imperii abscessio in decem reges divisi, Antichristum superinducit; The decay of the Romane Empire being divided into ten kingdomes, shall bring in Antichrist. SaintEp. ad Algas. Jerome strikes neerer the Popes triple crowne: The purple Whore is Rome, and her name of blasphemy is, Roma aeterna. SaintEp. ad Thes. Vacantem Im∣perii principa∣tum invadet. Chrysostome expresly affirmeth, that Antichrist his throne shall be the vacant seat of the Romane Empire. SaintGreg. ep. l. 4. Sacerdotum ei paratur exerci∣tus. Gregory seemeth to have received some particu∣lar advertisement of the approach of the man of sinne in his dayes: Anti∣christ (saith he) is setting forth, and an army of Priests is levied for him. Lay all these particulars together, and the totall summe will be, that the Pope is Antichrist. The name of Antichrist is Latinus, his seat is Rome, his rising is upon the fall of the Empire, his guard is an army of Priests. Saint Gre∣gory implies that Antichrist shall be a Bishop.P. Mouline contr. Coeffet. part. 3. Accom∣prirement des prophecies. Irenaeus that he shall be a La∣tine, or of the Latine Church. Saint Jerome that Rome shall be his See. Tertullian and Chrysostome, that hee shall waxe in the waine of the Ro∣mane Empire. The Romane Empire is fallen long since, being divided into ten kingdomes to wit, of the Almanes, England, France, Spaine, Den∣marke, Scotland, Poland, Navarre, Hungary, Naples, and Sicilie. These an∣cients were farre from the times of Antichrist, and yet you see how right they aime at him:Catalog. test. verit. the lesser marvell that many in succeeding ages, as Echar∣dus, Otho Frisingensis, Robert Grosthead, Dulcinus Navarenus, Marsilius Patavinus, Dantes, Michael Cesenus, Johannes de Rupe-scissa, Franciscus Pe∣trarcha, Henricus de Hassia, Walter Brute, John Huz, Johannes de Vesalia, & divers others hit him full, and fastened upon him the name of Antichrist. For they as being neere him, saw in him cleerly all those markes, whereby Saint Paul and Saint John describe that man of sinne, and son of perdition. from which we thus argue: He in whom all or the principall marks of Antichrist are found, he is the Antichrist. But in the Pope all or the principall marks of Antichrist are to be found: Ergo the Pope is the Antichrist.
By Pope we understand not this or that Pope in individuo, but rather in specie, or to speak more properly, the whole succession of Popes, from Bo∣niface the third, or at least Gregory the seventh, otherwise called Helde∣brand. As the word Divell in the New Testament for the most part signi∣fieth not any particular spirit, but indefinitely an evill spirit, or the king∣dome of Sathan: and as the foure beasts in Daniel stand not for foure Mo∣narchs, but foure Monarchies; so the Beast in the Apocalypse, in whose ougly shape Antichrist appeares, seemeth not to represent any singular Pope, but the See of Rome after it degenerated into the Papacy. Now in the Bishops of Rome after Boniface and Heldebrand, we find the name, the seat, the apparrell, the pride, the cruelty, the idolatry, the covetousnesse, the imposture, the power, and the fortune of Antichrist. 1. The name of Antichrist containeth in it the number 666. which Ire∣naeus findeth in the word Latinus, . 2. The seat of Antichrist is a City built upon seven hills that ruleth over the whole world: this City Propertius will tell you to be Rome, Septem urbs clara jugis, toti quae praesidet orbi. 3. The ornaments of Antichrist are scarlet, and purple, gold, jewells, and precious stones, which the Pope weares, especially on high dayes. 4. The time of Antichrist his rising is fore-told to be after the division of the Romane Empire: after which it appeares by all stories, that the Pope grew to his greatnesse. 5. The vices of Antichrist are these especially: 1. Pride: he shall exalt himselfe above all that is called God, that is, Princes; and doth not the Pope so, who admitteth them to kisse his feet, arrogateth to himselfe a power over them to depose them, and dispose of their kingdomes? 2. Idolatry or spirituall fornication: the great Whore is said to commit fornication with the Princes of the earth; and doth not the Pope intice all Kings and Princes to idolatry, which is spirituall for∣nication? 3. Cruelty: the Whore is said to bee drunke with the bloud of Saints. I need not apply this note, both their owne and our stories relate of many thousands by the Popes meanes put to death for the profession of the Gospel, under the names of Lionists, Waldenses, Albigenses, Wickliffists, Hussites, Lutherans, Calvinists, and Hu∣gonots. 4. Imposture: Antichrist shall come after the power of Sathan, in all power of signes and lying wonders; and who pretend miracles, and abuse the world with Legends of lyes, but the Popes adhe∣rents? 5. Covetousnesse: through covetousnesse hee shall with feigned words make merchandize of you. Now the wares wherewith the Whore of Babylon deceiveth the world, what are they but her par∣dons, indulgences, hallowed beads, medalls, Agnus Dei's, and the like? 6. The Beast is said to haveApoc. 18.11. hornes like a Lambe, and to speake like a Dragon, and to exercise all the power of the first beast. This agreeth to the
Papacy and Pope, who resembleth Christ, whose Vicar he calleth him∣selfe, and arrogateth to himselfe Christs double power, both Kingly and Priestly. He exerciseth also the power of the first beast, to wit, the Romane Empire described by seven heads and ten hornes, because as the first beast, the Romane Empire by power and temporall authority, so the Pope by policy and spirituall jurisdiction ruleth over a great part of the world. 7. It is written of the Whore of Babylon, that the Kings of the earth should give their power to her for a time, but that in the end they shouldApoc. 17.13, 16. hate her, and make her desolate; which we see daily more and more fulfilled in the Papacy. I will be as briefe in the application, as I have been long in the explica∣tion of this Scripture. Babylon is figuratively Rome, and Rome is mysti∣cally Babylon. The Edomites the instigators of the Babylonians, and part∣ners with them in the spoyle of the Israelites, may well represent unto us Romish Priests and Jesuited Papists, rightly to be termed Edomites from Edome, signifying red or bloudy. For a bloudy generation they are, as ap∣peareth by their treasonable practices against Queen ELIZABETH of happy memory, and our gracious Soveraigne now reigning. These verily seeme the naturall sonnes of Esau, who hated Jacob because God loved him, and sought to destroy him and his posterity because their father blessed them; even so they hate our Jacob, and seeke to root out his posterity, because God hath blessed him with so many crownes, and crowned him with so many blessings. They had thought in their mindes, as we reade, Genes. 27. The daies ofGen. 27.41. mourning will come shortly, and then wee will kill Jacob. But blessed be the God of Jacob, who delivered his annointed from the power of the sword. The more I looke upon the Edomites or Esauites, the more likenesse I find between them and our unnaturall countri-men, Jesuited Papists. The E∣domites pretended that they were of the elder house of Isaac, and these pretend that they are of the elder Church, which is the house of God. The Edomites, though they were brethren to the Jewes, yet they behaved themselves towards them like mortall enemies; even so our English Pa∣pists, though they are our kinsmen and countri-men, yet since Pope Pius his excommunication of Queen ELIZABETH, they have proved the most dan∣gerous enemies both of our Church and State: even in this resembling the Edomites, that as they not only vexed and persecuted the people of God themselves, but also instigated the Babylonians against them; so these not content to plot treasons, sow sedition, stirre up rebellion in our kingdome, have dealt with forraine Kings & States to invade our Kingdome, and root out both Church and Common-wealth. What pity is it that our Rebecca should have her bowells rent within her by two such children striving in her wombe? It followeth, In the day of Jerusalem. Jerusalem had a day, af∣ter which she slept in dust; & the daughter of Babylon appointed a day for England, a fatall and dismall day, a blacke and gloomy day, or rather a Go∣morrhean night, in which a hellish designe against our Church and Com∣mon-wealth was attempted, and if God himselfe had not miraculously de∣feated it, it had been acted: a designe to destroy both at once with fire and brimstone, not falling downe from heaven, but rather rising up from hell;
I meane a deep vault digged by the myners of Antichrist, and fraught with juysses, billets, barres of iron, and 36. barrells of gun-powder, like so ma∣ny great peeces of Ordnance full charged, and ready to bee shot off all at once, to blow up the house of Parliament, with the royall stocke, and the three estates of the Kingdome. Remember, O Lord, the children of Edome in that day, or rather for that day, in which (shall I say) they said, Raze it, raze it to the very foundation? they more than said it, or cried it, they would have thundered it out; they assayed it, they did what they could to raze it. For they planted their murdering artillery at the very foundation of it. Cursed be their wrath, for it was fierce; and their rage, for it was furious, nay barbarous, nay prodigious, to cut off root and branch at once, to beat downe City and Temple with one blow, to snatch away on the sudden the King and Prince, Queen and Nobles, Bishops and Judges, Barons and Bur∣gesses, Papists and Protestants, Friends and Enemies, and carry them up in a fiery cloud, and scatter their dismembred members, or rather ashes over the whole City. O daughter of Babylon, worthy to bee destroyed because thou delightest in destruction; happy shall he be that taketh thy young chil∣dren and monstrous brats, viz. treasons, plots, conspiracies, and unnaturall designes against Prince and State, and dasheth them against the stones. To draw towards an end, and to draw you to a reall thanks-giving to God for the deliverance of the three estates of the Kingdome, like the three children from the fiery furnace heat by the daughter of Babylon. God hath done great things for us this day, whereat wee rejoyce; let us doe some∣thing to him and for him: he hath remembred us not in words, but in deeds, let us remember him as well in deeds as words: let us honour him with our substance, let us blesse him with our hands, let us praise him with our goods. Peradventure you will say, OurPsal. 16.2. goods are nothing to him, our goodnesse extendeth not unto him, he is far above us, and out of the reach of our cha∣rity: see how the Prophet himselfe removeth this rub in the next verse, But to the Saints that are on the earth, and to them that excell in vertue. And our Saviour assureth us, thatMat. 25.40. Verely, verely, I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto mee. Whatsoever we doe unto them, Christ taketh it as done unto himselfe. In feeding the hungry ye feed Christ, in clothing the naked ye cloth him, in visiting the imprisoned ye visit him. Though ye can∣not now with Mary Magdalen reach up to his head to breake a boxe of Spicknard, and powre it on him, yet ye can annoint him in his sicke and sore, comfort him in his afflicted, provide for him in his famished, relieve him in his oppressed, yea and redeem him also in his captive members. This to doe is charity and mercy at all times, but now it is piety and devotion also. It is not sufficient for you to lift up your hands in prayer and thanksgiving, ye must stretch them out in pious andHeb. 13.16. charitable contributions: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. And if ever such sacrifices are due to him, now especially upon the yeerly returne of the feast wee celebrate for the preservation of our King and Kingdome, Church and Common-wealth, Nobles and Commons, Goods and Lands, nay Religion and Lawes from the vault of destruction. Remember, O Lord, the children of Edome in that day what they said, Novelties shall passe with a crack, and Heretickes shall receive a blow: and what they assayed, even to raze Jerusalem and Sion to the ground: and forget not, O Lord, the Whore of Babylon, which hath
dyed her garments scarlet red in the bloud of thy Saints and Martyrs: make all her lovers to forsake her, and abhorre her poysoned doctrine, though offered in a cup of gold. Strip her of her gay attire, pluck down her proud looks, & humble her before thy Spouse: and if she will not stoop nor re∣pent her of her spirituall fornication & savage cruelty against the profes∣sours of the truth, reward her as shee hath served us. But as for those that have forsaken Babel, & joyne with us in the defence & confirmation of the Gospel, prosper them in all the reformed Churches, and grant that as they all agree in the love of the same truth, so they may seek that truth in love, and that their love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all judgement, that they may discerne those things that differ, and approve of those things that are excellent; that they may be sincere, and without offence till the day of Christ, being filled with the fruits of righteousnesse, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. Cui, &c.
SERMONS PREACHED IN LAMBETH PARISH CHURCH.
THE WATCHFULL SENTINELL. A Sermon preached the fifth of November. THE LXI. SERMON. PSAL. 121.4. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleepe. THe more the enemies of the Gospel endevour to blot out this feast out of our Calender, and raze it out of the memory of all men, by giving it out where they see the coast cleare, and none to encounter their falshood, that the ground of this dayes devotion was a fiction of ours, not a designe of theirs; a stratagem of state to scanda∣lize them, not a plot of treason to ruine our King and State: by so much the more all that love the truth in sinceritie ought to keep it with more fervencie of devotion, celebrity of publique meeting, and so∣lemnity of all corresponding rites and ceremonies, that the voyce of our thanksgiving, and the sound of Gods praise for so great a deliverance, may ring to the ends of the earth, and the children yet unborne may heare it. O∣ther feasts we celebrate by faith, this by experience and sense: other deli∣verances we beleeve, this we feele: the ground of other festivities are Gods benefits upon his people indeed, but of other countreyes and other times, but of this is, the preservation of our owne Countrey, in our owne time. And therefore what S. Bernard spake of the feast of Dedication, we may say of this:In fest. dedic. Tantò nobis debet esse de∣votior, quanto est familiarior. Nam caeteras quidem solem∣nitates cum a∣liis ecclesiis habemus com∣munes, haec nobis est pro∣pria, ut necesse sit à nobis vel à nemine cele∣brari. We ought the more religiously to keepe this feast, by how much the more neare it concernes us; for other solemnities wee have common with other Churches, this is so proper to us, that if wee celebrate it not, none will. This wee ought in speciall to owne, because it presenteth to all thankfull hearts, a speciall act of Gods watchfull care over our Church, our Nation,
yea and this place. For this monster of all treasons, which no age can pa∣rallel, was conceived within our precincts, and so it should have brought forth ruine and destruction in our eyes, if God had not crushed it in the shell: we should have seen on the sudden the citie over against us all in a light fire, all the skie in a cloud of brimstone, and the river died with bloud: wee should have heard nothing after the cracke of thunder, but out-cries and voyces in Ramah, weeping and mourning, and exceeding great lamentation, our Rachel mourning for her children, and shee would not have beene comfor∣ted, because they should not have beene. The lowder the cry of our sorrow would then have beene, the lowder ought now to be the shouts of our joy. To which purpose I have made choyce of this verse for my text, taken out of a Psalme of degrees, that I might thereby raise my meditations and your affections to the height of this feast. The words may serve as a motto, and the worke of this day for an image to make a perfect embleme of Gods watchfull care over his people, and the peoples safetie under the wings of his providence. But before I enter upon the parts of this Psalme, it will be requisite that I cleare the title, a Song of degrees. If the meaning be as some translate the words, Shur hamagnaloth, Canticum excellentissimum, an excellent song, as we read, Adam hamagnaloth, a man of eminent degree; are not all the other Psalmes likewise excellent songs? Why then hath this onely, with some few that follow it, the garland set upon it? Some will have these fif∣teene Psalmes beginning from the 120. to have the name of songs of de∣grees, , or , from the history, others from the ceremony, a third sort from the musicke, and the fourth from the matter and speciall contents of them. 1. They who fetch it from the history, affirme that these Psalmes were penned, or at least repeated, and sung by theEzra 7.4. Jewes Hamagnaloth, in their ascending or comming up from Babylon into their owne Countrey: and this conceit is the more probable, because some of the Psalmes speake ex∣pressely of their returne from captivitie, and most of them of Gods delive∣rance of his people from great dangers and troubles. 2. They who deduce it from the sacred rite or ceremony used in the singing of them, relate that the Priest sang these Psalmes Hamagnaloth, or , upon the staires or steps, as they marched up into the house of the Lord. 3. They who derive the name from the musicke, report that these Psalmes were sung hamagnaloth, that is, with ascensions, or raising up the voyce by degrees, as it is said that the Levites praised God with a great voyce, or a voyce on high. 4. They who take it from the speciall contents of theseChrysost. in Psal. 20. Psalmes, con∣tend that the verses of this Psalme are like the , rounds of Jacobs ladder, on which we may ascend up to heaven, as the Angels did upon that. These reasons are in a kinde of sequence like notes in musick: for be∣cause they are Psalmes full of speciall matter for instruction and comfort, it is likely that the chiefe Musitian set them to an higher cliffe; and because both tune as well as ditty were excellent, it is probable that these were selected, both to be sung by the Jewes in their ascending from Babylon,
as also by the Priests in their going up usually into the Temple. Thus the title is cleared on all hands: now the song it selfe admitteth a like partition to that of the Musitians in their pricked lessons; which con∣sist of, 1. A ground. 2. Running in division upon it. Here the ground containes but three notes: 1. The person, he. 2. The attribute, watchfull providence or protection. 3. The object, his people Israel. The division upon the first note is Jehovah, vers. 1. which was, and which is, and which is to come; maker of heaven and earth, vers. 2. Upon the second, thy keeper, vers. 3. thy preserver, vers. 7, 8. thy pro∣tectour in danger, vers. 5. from danger, vers. 7. for the time present and fu∣ture, verse the last. Upon the third, Israel in generall, vers. 4. every one of Israel in particu∣lar, vers. 5. in body and soule, vers. 7. at home and abroad, vers. 8. Behold, let your eye be upon him, whose eye never sleepeth nor slum∣breth, observe your observer and preserver. Behold in hee, sovereigne majestie and omnipotent power: in keepeth, his gracious protection: in Is∣rael, his peculiar affection: in neither slumbreth nor sleepeth, his continuall watchfulnesse. Behold, we have rung this larum bell heretofore, to awake your attenti∣on and affection, and now it giveth no uncertaine sound: but what or whom are we to behold? Hee. In the next verse the Prophet nameth him; Jehovah is thy keeper. Of all names of God this may seeme to challenge a kinde of precedencie: for it is taken from the essence of God, and never in Scripture is attributed to any creature; this is , the Greekes Tetragram∣maton, the Latines Jove, the Jewes Dread and Feare; who when they meet with it in the old Testament, adore it with silence, or fill up the sentence with Adonai, Lord: onely as wee read in the Talmud, the high Priest in his holy vestments, when he entred into the Sanctum Sanctorum, in the sa∣cred action of blessing the people, might pronounce it. Every syllable in it is a mystery; Je hath relation to the time future, ho to the present, vah to that which is past, as some of the Rabbins observe. And some Christian In∣terpreters conceive, that S. John alludes thereunto in the description of God, ,Apoc. 1.8. Hee which was, and is, and is to come. The verb from whence the name is derived signifieth to be, either to teach us that all beeing is from him, or that he alone may simply & absolutely be said to be, who was from all eternity what hee is, and shall be to all eternity what he was and is; or to give usExod. 6.3. assurance of the performance of all his promises. How shall wee doubt of any word that proceeds from his mouth, whose name carrieth in it existence or performance of all his words? or to insinuate in this name the best definition of his nature, which is this; an infinite spi∣rit, who is his owne being; or, who hath being from himselfe, in himselfe, and for himselfe. All creatures were of him, are in him, and must bee for him: God alone is of himselfe, in himselfe, and for himselfe. Some wierdraw
farther, and make so small a line, that it will scarce hold, viz. that all the letters in this name are quiescent, to intimate quietem in solo deo esse, that the rest of the soule is onely in God; according to that divine speech of S. Austine, Domine, fecisti nos ad te, & inquietum est cor nostrum donec perve∣niat ad te: O Lord, thou hast made us to or for thee, and our heart will never be at rest till we come to thee. That keepeth. God keepeth us both immediately by himselfe, and medi∣ately by Angels & men. His Angels are our guardians in all our wayes: Ma∣gistrates both ecclesiasticall and civill, Parents, Tutors, and Masters, kee∣pers in time of peace; and Generals, Captaines and Souldiers in time of warre. And if you demand with the Poet, Quis custodes custodiet ipsos? Who shall looke to the overseers of others? who shall watch our watch∣men, and guard our guardians? I answer, this Custos Israelis in my text. There are two sorts of keepers, 1. Some keepe from suffering evill, as a Guardian doth his Ward. 2. Others keep from doing evill, as the Lievtenant of the Tower, or a Messenger to whose custody a prisoner is committed. God is our keeper in both senses; for he is both Custos protectionis, and Custos conversationis: he keepeth us from suffering evill, by his protecting power; and from doing evill, by his restraining grace: hee keepes us in prosperity, that it corrupt us not; in adversity, that it conquer us not: hee keepeth us in our conception from abortion, in our birth from hurt, in our life from manifold dangers, in our death from eternall terrours. Israel. Israel, as the learned distinguish, is sometimes taken for Israel, 1. According to the flesh only, as unbeleeving Jewes. 2. According to the spirit only, as beleeving Gentiles. 3. According to the flesh and spirit, as the beleeving posterity of Jacob. For as Tertullian spake of Christian Souldiers and Panims,De coron. mil. Ap d Deum tam mi∣les est Paga∣nus fidelis, quam Paganus est miles infi∣delis. a faithfull Pagan is as well a Souldier in Gods account, as an unfaithfull Souldier is a Pagan: so we may truly say, that an unbeleeving Israelite is a Gentile, and a beleeving Gentile is a true Israelite. Howbeit the former division is not adequate: a more complete may be this; Israel is taken in holy Scripture, 1. For the root, to wit, Jacob himselfe, to whom first the name of Israel was given upon a speciall occasion. 2. For the stocke or trunke, the whole posteritie of Jacob. 3. For the branch, to wit, the ten Tribes divided from the other two in Rehoboams time. 4. For the whole tree as it were, that is, the whole number of the elect, who because they prevaile with God, are tearmed Israe∣lites, and of Israel: in this last and largest sense the words of S. Paul are to bee understood,Rom. 11.26. All Israel shall be saved. Here Israel is taken primarily for the Church and Common-wealth of the Jewes: but secondarily and consequently, for all Kingdomes and States professing the true worship of God, and commending themselves to his protection. As God is the Saviour of all, but especially the elect: so he is the keeper of all his creatures, but of man above all, and of Israel above all men.
Hee keepeth all, 1. Creatures in their state. 2. Men in their wayes and callings. 3. Israel in his favour. 1. All creatures by his power. 2. All men by his providence. 3. Israel by his grace. 1. All creatures from disorder and utter confusion. 2. All men from manifold calamities and miseries. 3. Israel from the power of sinne and death. Hee keepeth Israel, 1. As his chiefe treasure, most watchfully. 2. As his dearest spouse, most tenderly. 3. As the apple of his eye, most charily and warily. Hee keepeth every faithfull soule, 1. As his chiefe treasure, that the Divell steale it not. 2. As his chaste spouse, that the flesh abuse it not. 3. As the apple of his eye, that the world hurt it not. In this respect, as Israel is elsewhere called hisExod. 19.5. Deut. 14.2. peculiar people; so here his peculiar charge: he maketh more account of Israel than all the world besides, he keepeth Israel above all, nay he keepeth all for his Israels sake, that is, the elect. As he preserved the Arke for Noahs sake, and Goshen for the ancient Israelites sake, and all that were in the ship for S. Pauls sake, and all that were in the bath for S. Johns sake, and all that fled to the tombs of the Martyrs in Rome, when the Goths sacked the citie, for the Christians sake: so at this day hee supporteth all Kingdomes and States, for the Churches sake. The world is as an hop-yard, the Church as the hops, King∣domes, States, and Common-wealths as the poles: and as the owner of the hop-yard preserveth the poles and stakes carefully, not for themselves, but that the hops may grow upon them: so God preserveth all states and societies of men, that they may be a support to his Church. We may take this note higher, and truly affirme that he keepeth heaven and earth for her sake; the earth to be as a nursery for her children, to grow a while; and the Heaven for his garden and celestiall Paradise, whither hee will transplant them all in the end. Wherefore although the world never so much scorne, and contemne, and maligne, and persecute Gods chosen; yet it is indebted to them for its being and continuance: for God keepeth the heavens for the earth, the earth for living creatures, other living creatures for men, men for Israel, and Israel for the elect sake. For their sake it is, that the heavens move, the sunne, moone, and starres shine, the winds blow, the springs flow, the rivers run, the plants grow, the earth fructifieth, the beasts, fowles, and fishes multiply: for as soone as grace hath finished her worke, and the whole number of the elect is accomplished, nature shall utterly cease, and this world shall give place to a better, in which righteousnesse shall2 Pet. 3.13. dwell. Yet when heaven and earth shall passe, this word of God shall not passe: for he that now keepeth militant Israel in the bosome of the earth, shall then keepe triumphant Israel in Abrahams bosome. Shall neither slumber nor sleepe. What the Roman Oratour spake plea∣santly
of Caninius his Consulship, that set with the sunne, and lasted but for one day,Erasm. in Apoph. Cic. Vigilantissimum habuimus Consulem, qui toto Consulatu suo somnum non cepit; there was never so vigilant a Consul as Caninius, who during all the time of his Consulship never tooke a nap; may truly be said of the keeper of Israel, that he never suffereth his eyes to sleepe, nor his eye-lids to slumber. Rejoyce, O daughter of Sion, for the keeper of Israel continually wat∣cheth over thee for good: but tremble, O thou whore of Babylon, for hee continually watcheth over thee for evill. Ne time à malo externo, fi∣delis anima, quia non dormit custos qui te conservat; time tibi à peccato & malo interno, quia non dormit custos qui te observat: O faithfull soule, feare not outward evils, because hee sleepeth not who conserveth thee; but bee afraid of sin and inward evill, because hee sleepeth not who observeth thee. God receiveth Israel into his speciall protection, and there is no safetie out of it: Israel is now confined within the bounds of the Church, and que∣stionlesse out of it there is no safety. While the Souldiers are within the leaguer, they may sleepe all night securely, because they know the Senti∣nels keepe their watches: but if they wander abroad, and sleepe overtake them, they are every houre in danger to have their throats cut. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleepe. What the Apostle S. Paul professeth of himselfe (Aug. ep. ad Hieron. non mentientis astu, sed compati∣entis affectu)1 Cor. 9.22. I am made all things to all men, that I may by all meanes win some; may in a true and pious sense be applyed to God himselfe, who to turne us, and gaine us to himselfe, turneth himselfe (after a sort) into all formes and natures. To allure the hungry, hee becomes bread; to excite the thirsty, a fountaine of living water; to draw to him the naked, a wedding garment; to bring in them that are astray, the way; to revive the dead, the resurrection and the life. This accordeth withHom. 1. in. Cant. Singulis quibusque sen∣sibus animae singula quae{que} Christus effi∣citur: idcirco verum lumen, ut habeant a∣nimae quo il∣luminentur: idcirco verbū, ut habeant aures quod audiant: id∣circo panis vi∣tae, ut habeat gustus quod degustet: id∣circo unguen∣tum & nardus, ut habeat odo∣ratus animae fragrantiam verbi: idcirco & palpabilis & verbum caro dicitur, ut pos∣sit interioris animae manus contingere de verbo vitae. Origen his note on the Canticles: Christ becommeth to everie sense a most delectable object; light, that the eyes of the soule may have wherewith to be enlightened; the word, that the eares may have wherewith to be filled or rounded; the bread of life, that the taste may have to please it, and stomacke to satisfie it; spicknard, to delight the smell of the soule; lastly, flesh, that the hands of the soule may handle the word of life. (1 Joh. 1.1.) O how should this enflame our love to God, that hee should become to our soule whatsoever shee can desire! And not this onely, but that he should condescend in love to take upon him all cal∣lings and offices, for the safetie, well-fare, and comfort of his Church. To give her contentment in himselfe, he weddeth her, and becomes her hus∣band: to dresse her vines, and ripen her fruits, her husband-man: to in∣struct her in the doctrine of salvation, her Schoole-master: to cure her dis∣eases, her Physitian: to plead her title to the kingdome of heaven, her Advocate: and lastly, to keepe her from all ghostly and bodily enemies, her Guardian and Watch-man. That which Cain refused to bee to his owne brother, God is to his Church, that is, her keeper; and so watchfull and carefull a keeper is hee, that his eye is never off her day nor night. The point of speciall observation in the whole text is, the watchfull eye of Gods providence over his Church, which never closeth, nor so much as win∣keth. The parts are,
1. The person, who tendeth and tendreth Israel, hee. 2. The office he undertaketh and performeth, keepeth. 3. His charge, that is, the object of his care, Israel. 4. His vigilancie over his charge, neither slumbreth nor sleepeth. The enemies of the Church are either bodily or ghostly: against the former he fenceth her with his power, against the latter with his grace. To keepe, is to looke to, preserve and protect, save and defend from all violence or injurie, waste or spoyle, hurt or destruction: as an husband doth his wife, a guardian his ward, a tutour his pupill, a Centurion his band, a watchman his quarter, a shepherd his flocke, a keeper his parke. And all these relations the Church hath to Christ, in regard of the kinde offices which he continually performeth to her in greatest love. For shee is his spouse, and he her husband: she his ward, and he her guardian: she his pu∣pill, and he her tutour: she his band, and he her Sentinell: shee his citie, and he her watch-man: she his flocke, and he her shepherd: she his parke, or rather deere, and he her keeper. In the verse immediately going before, the Prophet spake in the singu∣lar number, he shall keepe thee: but here in the plurall, extending the care of God to the Church in generall, to teach us that our heavenly father holdeth such a watchfullAugust. confess. Sic curas unum∣quemque tanquam solú cures, & sic omnes tan∣quam singu∣los. eye of providence over every one of his faithfull children, as if he tended him onely, and yet taketh such a care of all in ge∣nerall, as of every one in particular. Shall neither slumber nor sleepe.Aristot. de som. & vigil. Somnus est ligatio sensuum: Sleepe is the tying of the senses: which if they be heart-bound, wee are said to sleepe; if slacke, or loose, to slumber. The senses of our body are the windowes of the soule, which in a slumber are as it were shut to, but barred and bolted when we are fast asleepe. Like as we see sometimes there ariseth out of the earth a thin mist, which the sunne easily pierceth with his beames, and di∣sperseth it with his heat; sometimes a thicke vapour mounteth up to the middle region of the aire, where by the temper of the place it is turned into a dark cloud that obscureth the skie for many houres: in like manner, when a thin fume ascendeth from the stomacke into the braine, it causeth but a slumber, out of which wee easily rouze up our selves; but when a grosse vapour climbeth up thither, it overcasteth the cleare skie of our fancie, and in the fall stoppeth all the passages of our senses, and then we sleepe sound∣ly. But I need not discourse of the nature of sleepe and slumber, there be few here but too accurately distinguish them: for though they count it a foule shame to sleepe out a Sermon, yet they make no scruple of conscience to slumber, and sometimes nod; who shall not need withAristot. vit. praefix. op. Aristotle to hold a brazen ball in their hand over a bason, to awake them if sleepe chance to surprize them: if the words of our Saviour continually ring in their eares,Mark. 14.37. Can yee not watch with me one houre? Out of this briefe representation of the nature of sleepe, it appeareth that it is a matter of much more difficul∣tie to abstaine from slumbring, than from sleeping: therefore the mem∣bers of this sentence may seeme to be displaced; and thereforeCalvin in Psal. 121. Calvin andBucer in Psal. 121. Bucer thus translate the words, Non dormitat, nedum dormit; hee that keepeth Israel never slumbreth, much lesse sleepeth: or wee may paraphrase the words thus, Hee that keepeth Israel, neither suffereth his eye-lids to
slumber by day, nor his eyes to sleepe by night; but keepeth a continuall watch over his people. The words thus illustrated, present to our serious thoughts these most important considerations: 1. That God himselfe is the Churches keeper. 2. That how many, or how great enemies soever lye in wait for her, ye she is kept. Israel is an impregnable castle, not by reason of the nature of the place or situation, nor in regard of the great store of men and munition in it: but because he that keepeth it doth neither slumber nor sleepe. Ecclesia oppug∣natur saepe, expugnatur nunquam. Many times have theyPsal. 129.1, 2. fought against me from my youth up, may Israel now say: Many a time have they afflicted mee from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against mee. There can be no State, Societie, Kingdome, or Common-wealth, so strongly built and fen∣ced, but if the flouds of sedition arise, and the raging tempest of forraine forces beat upon it, it may be ruinated, because it is founded upon sand, that is, men who are but sand and dust: but let the flouds of persecution arise, and the wind of heresie blow never so furiously upon the Church, yet it will stand, because it is built upon the rocke Christ Jesus. What speake wee of clouds, which are the windowes of heaven? the gates ofMatt. 16.18. hell shall never be able to prevaile against it. By the gates of hell, many learned Interpre∣ters understand the counsels, projects, plots, and designes of wicked men; be∣cause, for the most part, the counsell among the Jewes, for their better se∣curity, sate in their gate-houses, which in all strong cities are best fenced by nature or art. For which cause the spirit of God describeth the strength of any citie or countrey by the gates thereof. He shallPsal. 147.13. make fast the barres of thy gates: and, ThyGen. 22.17. seed shall possesse the gate of the enemie, that is, thy seed shall take their garrisons, and occupy their strongest holds. If we like of the former interpretation, Now Israel, now England may say, the gates of hell, that is, the deepe projects and counsels, plots and machinations of the Miners of Antichrist, as deepe as hell, have not prevailed against mee: Or if yee please, yee may take the barrels of gun-powder laid in the vault of destruction, and chambers of death, for the gates of hell; and the massie peeces of iron and wood, for the barres of these gates, which if the Divell or his instruments could have then broken open in a moment, in the twinck∣ling of an eye, our King and Parliament, Nobles and Commons, Clergie and Gentrie, with the chiefe records and monuments of this Kingdome, had beene blowne up with the breath of Satan, in a cloud of fire and brim∣stone into the aire. That blast, in all likelyhood, would have proved the last gasp of our Church and Common-wealth. If he that keepeth Israel, first God, next the King, had slept or slumbred that night: it is to be feared, wee all here present had long ere this slept our last sleepe in the dust of the earth. But blessed be the God of Israel, who hath saved and redeemed his people from the paw of the Divell and jawes of death, and hath raised up a mightie salvation for us in the hand of his servant James. The Divell and his instruments doe not watch so narrowly to destroy us, as God and his Angels to save and protect us. Hee that saveth our life, in effect giveth it; and therefore Aristotle moveth a question, whom wee are more bound to rescue, though it bee with the perill of our lives, our father, or such a
friend who hath ventured his life for us, and saved us from certaine death. The decision whereof may be this, That we owe our life to both; but it being impossible that we should pay it to both, in all reason we are to lay it downe for him first, to whom it was first due, and that is our father: Whereupon it ensueth, that we owe God many lives if we had them, be∣cause he not only gave us our life, but also saveth us from manifold deaths, both by ordinary and extradinary meanes, both by generall and speciall providence. His providence in generall looketh to all men good and bad, yea to all creatures whatsoever; which could not subsist for a moment, if he kept them not in the course of their nature. But above all creatures in speci∣all he is theJob 7.20. preserver of men; among men, the children ofDeut. 32.11. Israel were his portion, the lot of his inheritance, whom he kept as the apple of his eye. As an Eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings; so the Lord led Israel. Wee must goe yet farther; there is an Israel of Israel, to wit, the Elect in Israel, which are as a Diamond in the ring on his finger, & as theZach. 2.8. apple of his eye: He that toucheth you (saith he) toucheth the apple of mine eye. To them hee vouchsafeth more speciall favours; for them he blesseth the people where they are, as he blessed Labans house for Jacobs sake, and Pharaohs for Jo∣sephs sake. To this Israel belong the promises: He shall cover thee with hisPsal. 91.4, 10, 11, 12, 13. feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. There shall no evill befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. He shall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy wayes. They shall keep thee up in their hands, that thou dash not thy foot a∣gainst a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the Lion and the Adder: the young Lion and the Dragon shalt thou trample under feet. And it is the keeper of this Is∣rael which neither slumbereth nor sleepeth. Ye may here object, If he that keepeth Israel never slumbereth nor sleep∣eth, what meane those expostulations and calling up (if I may so speak) of Almighty God? Up,Psal. 44.23, 26. Lord, why sleepest thou? arise, cast us not off for ever: arise for our helpe, and redeeme us for thy mercies sake. If God hath need to be awaked, he must needs be at least in a slumber: If the loud cries of his afflicted children awake him, and he standeth up like a Giant refreshed with wine to fight for them, it should seem before he was asleep. It may seeme so indeed, because (according to outward appearance and semblance) hee was so. When a man is asleep, though any miscall him, or make mouthes at him, or put any indignity upon him, he stirreth not, nor hath any sense of any thing that is done to him. Upon this ground the sweet singer of Israel runnes in descant; Rise up,Psal. 9.19. Lord, let not man prevaile, let the Heathen bee judged in thy sight. WhyPsal. 35.23. standest thou afarre off, O Lord? WhyPsal. 44.23. hidest thou thy face in time of trouble? Awake, OPsal. 59 4. Lord, why makest thou as if thou hearest not? Awake to my judgement, awake, why sleepest thou? Awake to my help: and, Behold, let God arise, and let hisPsal. 68.1. enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him, &c. The slumber of Almighty God is nothing else but the connivency of his justice for a time, and it is mercy which casteth him into this sweet sleep, which yet doth not so surprise his powers, or any way bind his senses, but that hee seeth the deepest plots of his enemies, he heareth their secretest consultations, and is sensible of the
least wrong offered to his chosen. Oculi ejus vident, palpebrae ejus explorant filios hominum; he looketh through his eye-lids, and markes well enough, though hee seem to neglect it. As a fisher seeth a fish come to his hooke, nibble at the bait, bite it, and swallow it downe, and then he giveth a jerke with his angle-rod; so Almighty God permits wicked purposes and enter∣prises to hold on in a straight course, till they are even at the goale, and then he turnes and overturneth them: In foribus Hydriam; he breaketh the pitcher at the doore, cutteth downe the eare when it is full, launceth the sore when it is ripe. How did he suffer an invincible Navie, as they termed it, to be built and furnished for the invasion and utter subversion of our Israel, and so great a designe to be carried so close, that the Fleet was in sight of the haven before it was discovered? but then in the height of their swelling pride, when in hope and almost in sight they had devoured the whole kingdome: Claud. de Theodos.—militat aether, Et conjurati veniunt ad classica venti. Partly a tempest dispersed, partly wild-fire burned, partly the sea with open mouth swallowed downe their shipping. But this day presenteth afresh to our memory a stranger example of di∣vine providence, and a prodigious designe of Sathans malice, who put into the heart of that caitiffe Catesby, the most hellish project and plot of treason that ever entred into the heart of man or Divell, to offer up our King, Queen, Prince, Nobles, Prelates, Judges, and all States assembled in Par∣liament for a holocaust, or whole burnt offering to the Moloch of Rome. The keeper of Israel seemed for a long time to slumber, nay rather to be fast a∣sleep. The plot is contrived, the actors designed, the enginers provided, the mine digged, the wall pierced, the seller hired, the powder bought, the murdering artillery amassed, the traine laid, and the incendiary ready with match and touch-wood. O preserver of mankind, save us now, or we are all but a blaze. O keeper of Israel, O sentinell of Jacob sleepest thou now when our destruction sleepeth not? But, Ecce non dormitat, neque dormit custos Israelis; be of good cheare, the keeper of Israel doth neither slumber nor sleep. By this keeper the Pro∣phet meaneth Almighty God, whom hee nameth in the verses following, The Lord himselfe is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand: the Lord shall preserve thee from all evill: the Lord shall preserve thy soule: the Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy comming in from this time forth for evermore. and, Except thePsal. 127.1. Lord keep the City, the watchman waketh but in vaine. Yet in a second place we may entitle his majesty to this office of Lord-keeper: for he next under God watcheth over all Gods Israel in his kingdomes, and ecce non dormitat, neque dormit hic custos Israelis, the Lord keepeth this keeper of Israel awake, and in the dead time of the night disco∣vereth unto him the snares of death laid for him and his people. His Ma∣jesty receiveth the word from Almighty God, though spoken softly in his eare, and scarce audibly, & gave it to his faithfull servants, who by the dark light he gave them of some blow by powder, searched the place, and found theFax signifieth a torch or brand, Faux a chop. fire-brand of Hell, and chop of the Divell, Guido Faux, with a darke lanterne, making his traines, and sowing (if I may so speake) the seeds of all
our destruction. How many miracles have wee here of divine providence, and mirrours of his justice? Wonderfull strange it was, that the arch plotter Catesby should for many moneths keep within him that monstrous and prodigious designe, like strongest poyson, and never breake. Wonderfull strange it was, that so horrible and damnable a conspiracy should be after∣wards imparted by him to so many, noised abroad so far, brought to that maturity, that the successe thereof was prophesied by some inNovelties shall passe with a cracke, and he shall give them a blow, &c. scattered papers, prayed for almost by all of the Jesuites faction, at least in generall; and yet Argus with his hundred eyes, the great Counsellers of State, who have eyes and eares in all places, should have no notice of it till neere the houre in which it should have been acted: and most strange of all, that his Majesty by a violent and unnaturall construction of a phrase in a letter should find out the violent and unnaturall intendment of the authors of this treason, to destroy the state in asSee a dis∣course of the Powder trea∣son in the sup∣plement of Foxe his Mar∣tyrologie. little a time, as the letter would be burnt in the fire.

Their heads are lifted up above the house of Parliament, who would have blowne up the heads and peeres of our Realm thither. The quarters of the Black-birds of Hell, and Vultures of Anti∣christ, that would have preyed upon the barbarously murdered and cruelly quartered and dismembred corpses of our Church and Common-wealth, are set up for a prey for the fowles of heaven; and according to the letter of our daily prayer, the eyes that waited for the destruction of our King and State, are pecked out by the Ravens of the valley, and the birds of the aire have eaten them. ,Judg. 7.31 So let thine and our im∣placable enemies, O Lord, perish, but let them that love thee, be as the Sunne when hee goeth forth in his strength.

ABRAHAM HIS PURCHASE. A Sermon preached at the Consecration of the Church-yard inclosed within the new wall at Lambeth. THE LXII. SERMON. ACTS 7.16. And were carried over into Sechem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abra∣ham bought for a summe of mony of the sons of Emor, of Sechem. UPon the hearing of my Text read, I suppose many looke for a Funerall Sermon, and have already so christened my future discourse in their preconceits. For here is the carrying of the dead, and the interring, together with a place for buriall,Gen. 22.7. pur∣chased by Abraham for him and his heires for ever. But as Isaac said to his father Abraham, Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the Lambe for a burnt offering? so they may reason with themselves, Behold the bearers, and a sepulchre, and the ground, but where is the corps to be laid in it? My answer hereunto must be a thanksgiving to God, whose mer∣cy hath altered the case with us, because his compassions faile not. It stood lately thus with us, when the waies of Sion mourned, because none walked in them; and the gates of the Sanctuary lamented, because almost none, specially of the better ranke, who left us desolate, entred at them. Wee saw with weeping eyes and bleeding hearts a presse as it were of dead corpses, and many suing for a reversion of a void roome in our dormitory; but now (God be blessed) we have a place given for buriall, and no corpses at this present to take reall and corporall possession thereof. Howbeit, because what hath be fallen us heretofore, may also hereafter, and if death should strike any at this present without a writ of removall, which cannot bee sued out of any court for ought I know against the dead, wee know not where to bestow
them: wee could doe no lesse in Christian charity and providence, than procure the bounds of our Golgotha to be enlarged. For though other houses and tenements stand void with us, the grave shall never want guests, nor the Church-yard and vaults under ground tenants against their will. All men and women are flowers, and all flowers will fall, and when they are ready to fall, we shall have slips (I feare) but too many to plant this parcell of ground which wee have gained in by the gift of the father of this Si∣chem. But hereof hereafter, when I shall have opened my Text, and the sepul∣chre in it, and who were interred there, and how they came thither. If in any Text almost of the whole Scripture, surely in this the coherence need∣eth to be handled. For at the first sight this relation of the buriall of the Pa∣triarchs seemeth to have no affinity at all with Saint Stephens apologie for himselfe against the Jewes, who charged him with blasphemy against Mo∣ses, and against the Law. Now as in a shooting match a stander by can hardly discerne the flight of an arrow, unlesse he marke the Archers aime, and observe the flight-shaft as soon as it is delivered out of the bow; so un∣lesse ye marke Saint Stephens aime, and observe how he entereth into this story of the Old Testament, ye can hardly discerne how direct it is to his maine scope and purpose. But so it is, that as he that shooteth farre draw∣eth his arrow backward up to the head; and as hee that leapeth forward fetcheth his feeze a great way backe: so doth Saint Stephen here seem to give ground, and recoile a great way backward; but it is to come on with more force, and powerfully to confound the Jewes, who began not now to persecute the Saints of God, and Witnesses of Jesus Christ, but in all ages had done the like. Fabius Maximus (asLiv. dec. 3. l. 2. Livie writeth) kept aloofe off from the Carthaginian army upon a high hill, till hee saw that Hannibal had foiled Minutius in the plaine; but then hee falleth upon him, and routs all his troupes: whereupon Hannibal uttered that memorable speech, I ever feared that the cloud which hovered so long upon the hills would in the end powre downe, and give us a sad showre. Saint Stephen like Fabius for a great while keepeth aloof off from the Jewes, and his discourse resembleth a darke cloud hovering on the top of a hill, which on the sudden in the end rained downe upon them, and caused a bitter storme, for killing first all the servants sent to them by the Master of the Vineyard, and last of all his Sonne. The Jewes bragged much of their fathers; Saint Stephen by epitomizing the story of the Old Testament, sheweth unto them that they ought ra∣ther to be ashamed of them, in whose wicked steps notwithstanding they trod, and were now (as their fathers ever had bin) a stiffe-necked people, of un∣circumcised eares and hearts, resisting the spirit of God, and cruelly persecu∣ting those to death, who shewed before of the comming of the just One, of whom (saith he) ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: who have received the Law by the disposition of Angels, and have not kept it. The accusers of Saint Stephen articled against him, that hee had uttered blasphemy against the Law of Moses, and against the Temple, because hee taught that the ceremonies of the Law were fulfilled in Christ, and that the shadow ought to vanish, the body being come in place. Saint Stephen an∣swereth for himselfe, that the doctrine of the Gospel was ancienter than
the Law or the Temple, and that all the furniture of the Temple and Arke were made according to the patterne in the Mount, and had a reference to heavenly and spirituall things revealed in the Gospel: that God was now to be worshipped in spirit and truth, by faith in Christ now come, as hee had been by the fathers before the Law in Christ to come, who by faith gave charge that their bones should be carried out of Egypt, and buried in the land of Canaan, beleeving that God would certainly performe his promise made unto their posterity, first of the reall possession of the earthly, & after that of the heavenly inheritance by the seed of Abraham, in whom all Nati∣ons are blessed, Christ Jesus, that should be born in that land. What they gave in charge was accordingly performed, as ye heare in the words of my Text, So Jacob went into Egypt and dyed, he and our fathers, and were car∣ried over into Sichem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought, &c. Ye see the coherence, but ye cannot yet discerne the truth of the relati∣on, because there is a mist on the words, which hath caused many to misse their way; and it cannot bee otherwise dispelled, than by cleering this whole relation of Saint Stephen, and comparing it with the narration of Moses. 1. It is evident out of Genes. 23.16, 20. that Abraham for foure hundreds shekels of silver bought the field of Ephron the Hittite, which was in Machpelah, and therein a cave to bury the dead. 2. It is evident out of Genes. 33.19. that Jacob bought a parcell of a field where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor Sechems father, for a hundred peeces of mony. 3. It is evident likewise out of Genes. 50.13. that Jacobs sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field in Mach∣pelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burying place of Ephron the Hittite before Mamre. 4. It is evident out of Jos. 24.32. that the children of Israel brought the bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and buried them in Sechem in a parcell of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Sechem for a hundred peeces of silver, and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. Now the points of difficulty are three: 1. Whether all the Patriarchs were buried in Sechem, or only Joseph. For in the booke of Josuah there is mention made of none buried there but Joseph; yet Saint Stephen here speaketh in the plurall number, Our fathers dyed, and were carried over into Sechem. And Saint Jerome, who lived in those parts writeth, that in his time the sepulchre of the twelve Patriarchs was to be seen in Sechem. 2. Whether Abraham or Jacob bought this field wherein they were buried. For both bought ground for buriall, but not at the same rate, nor in the same place, nor from the same Landlords. For Abraham paid for his purchase foure hundred peeces of silver, Jacob an hundred: Abrahams lay in the country of Heth, Jacobs of Sechem: Abraham bought it of Ephron the Hittite, Jacob of Hamor the Sechemite. If the Patriarchs were laid in a se∣pulchre at Sechem, it could not be that which Abraham bought: for that was not in the tenure and occupation of the Sechemites, but of the Hittites.
3. Whether Hamor were the father or sonne of Sechem. For in Genesis we reade, that he was the father of Sechem: but in the Acts many translate , the son of Sechem. 1. The first doubt may be thus cleared. Joseph alone was buried in Se∣chem, and rested there: but the other Patriarchs were at the first buried at Sechem, but afterwards removed from thence to Ephron, and were buried all in Abrahams vault or cave: thus Josephus & S. Jerome are easily reconci∣led. For though the bones of them all lay in Ephron, yet at Sechem there might be some monument of them remaining, as empty tombes with some inscription. 2. The second difficulty is much more intricate, and those who have stroven to get out of it have more intangled themselves and others in it. Calvins answer is somewhat too peremptory, that there is an errour in all our copies of the New Testament, and ought to be corrected: and though Beza goe about to excuse the matter by a semblance of some like misno∣mer in the Gospel, yet this his observation, unlesse he could produce some ancient copies, wherein such mistakes were not to be found, openeth a dan∣gerous gap to Infidels and Heretickes, who hereby will be apt to take oc∣casion to question the infallible truth of the holy Writ. Canus in going a∣bout to take out the blot, maketh it bigger, saying, that Saint Luke erred not in relating Saint Stephens speech, but that Saint Stephens memory fai∣led him, and that through errour or inadvertency hee confounded Jacobs purchase with Abrahams. This answer commeth neere to blasphemy: for no man doubteth but that Saint Stephen in his speech spake as hee was inspired by the holy Ghost. Therefore Lyranus, Lorinus, and many others, think to salve all by putting two names upon the same man, whom they will have sometimes to be called Ephron, sometimes Hamor: but they bring no good proofe out of Scripture for it; and though they could make Ephron and Hamor the same man, yet they can never make the cave in the land of the Hittites, and that in the land of the Sechemites to be one and the same parcell of ground. With submission to more learned judgements (quia hic Delio opus est na∣tatore) I take it that either  should be rendred by, & joyned to the word , and a comma at , and so the sense is, That the Patriarchs were translated into Sechem by the Sechemites, and laid in Abrahams sepulchre which he bought for mony: or  to be understood, and then the meaning will be this, That some of the Patriarchs were laid in Abrahams sepul∣chre, some in the field that Jacob bought. Thus then (according to the originall) wee may render this verse, And they were carried over into Se∣chem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought, besides that which Ja∣cob bought of Hamor, that is: Jacob dyed, and our fathers, and some of them were bestowed in Sechem in the cave which Jacob bought, and some of them in that which Abraham bought. 3. The third doubt is easily resolved. For Hamor was the father of Se∣chem, as we reade Genes. 33.19. neither doth S. Stephen gain-say it: for his words are , of Sechem, which should have been translated the father of Sechem, as Herodotus in Clio saith, , and in Thalia, ,Mar. 15.40. and Saint Mark, . Adrastus of Mydas, to wit, the fa∣ther
of Mydas; Cyrus of Cambyses, that is, the father of Cambyses; Mary of James, that is, Mary the mother of James. The mist being thus dispelled, we may cleerly see our way, and readily follow the Patriarchs in the funerall procession from Egypt, first to Se∣chem, and afterwards to Ephron. And they were carried over, &c. This transportation offereth to our re∣ligious thoughts two acts: 1. Of Piety, 2. Of Charity. both significative and mysticall. For the carrying the Patriarchs bones from Egypt to Canaan, shadoweth our removall after death from Egyptian dark∣nesse to the inheritance of Saints in light; and the laying them by the bones of Abraham may represent unto us how the soules of all the faithfull im∣mediately after they were severed from their bodies, are carried by Angels into the bosome of Abraham. The first I call an act of piety or religion, be∣cause the Patriarchs before their death by faith gave charge of their bones; and their posterity executed their last Will in this point, to professe their faith in Gods promise, which was to give the land of Canaan to their seed for an inheritance, and accordingly by their dead bodies they tooke a kind of reall possession thereof. And they. As by a Synecdoche the soule is put for the man, Anima cu∣jusque is est quisque; so by the same figure the corpses of the Patriarchs are called the Patriarchs. Poole elegantly called his dead body his deposi∣tum: Scaliger his relique: Saint Paul the tent-maker agreeable to his pro∣fession, called it an earthly tabernacle. And although indeed it bee but the casket which containes in it the precious ring, our immortall spirit, yet in regard of the union of it to the soule, and because it concurreth with the soule to the physicall constitution of a man, it may by a figure be called a man. Yea, but had the Patriarchs no priviledge, but must they goe the way of all flesh? They must: for earth is in their composition, and into the earth must be their resolution. As the world is a circle, so all things in the world in this are like a circle, that they end where, or as they began. The vapours that are drawne up from the earth, fall downe againe upon the earth in rain. The fire that descended at the first from the region of fire in thePickolom. Phys. hollow of the Moone, ascends up thither againe. The waters that flow from the sea returne backe to the sea: in like manner the soule of man, which was infu∣sed by God, returneth to God that gave it; but the body, which was made of red earth, returneth to dust as it was. We need not inquire of Scripture where reason speaketh so plaine, nor interrogate reason where sense giveth daily testimony to the truth. Every passing bell rings this lesson in our eares: Omnis loculus locus est; every coffin is a topicke to prove it: every grave layes it open to us: every speechlesse man on his death-bed cries out to us, Memento mori, quod tueris eris. Were carried over into Sechem. The life of man is a double pilgri∣mage: 1. Of the outward man. 2. Of the inward man.
The outward travelleth from the cradle to the coffin, the inward from earth to heaven. Of all creatures man only is properly a pilgrim on earth; because he alone is borne, and liveth all his time here out of his own coun∣try: of all men the Patriarchs were the greatest pilgrims, both in life and death; for they spent all their life in wearisome and dangerous peregrina∣tions, and after their death their bodies went as it were in pilgrimage, and there visited first Sechem, and then Machpelah, where they tooke up their rest. It is the usuall wish and proverbiall speech of men, Though I toile and moile here, yet I hope one day I shall rest in my grave. No man can promise himselfe so much: for not only the bodies of men accursed of God have been digged out of their graves, to teach us, that there is no sanctuary for a wicked person living or dying; but even Gods servants have been often∣times removed out of their earthly beds, some in honour to them, and o∣thers out of malice again em, to dishonour and disgrace them. The bodies of Gervasius and Protasius, Martyrs, were translated from a blind and obscure place in Millaine where they lay, to a more celebrious and il∣lustrous Church, to doe them the greater honour: on the contrary, Euse∣bius writeth, that divers Martyrs in France were by the Gentiles plucked out of their graves, and burnt to ashes, and their ashes cast into the river Roan: and the Papists, as if they would make it knowne to the world that no Painims or Gentiles should out-do them, in wreaking their malice against the professors of the truth, both digged up Wickliffes and Peter Martyrs wives, and Paulus Fagius their bones after they had been long interred: Nec livor post fata quievit. The Tombe-stone is said to be the bound of malice, and death a supersedeas for envie and all uncharitable proceedings: yet blind zeale in persecuting the members of Christ Jesus exceeds these bounds, and all termes of com∣mon humanity. O unheard of cruelty, saith the blessed Martyr SaintCyp. de laps. Saevitum est in plagas, & jam in servis Dei non tor∣quebantur membra, sed vulnera. Cy∣prian, Their rage falleth upon the stripes of Gods servants, and they now tor∣ture not so much their members as their wounds. We may goe on further, because Popish cruelty hath gone on further, and say: Saevitum est in ca∣davera, saevitum est in ossa, saevitum est in cineres, saevitum est in manes: the rage and malice of Papists against Protestants is not satisfied with their bloud, nor expireth with their life; they fall like savage Jackals upon their carkasses, they digge up their graves, they rifle their coffins, they burne their bones, they persecute their ghosts; and this is their charity which they so much bragge of. But I leave them, and come to the sepulchre which A∣braham bought, where the Patriarchs were laid. And were laid in the sepulchre. Though it little import the soules of Gods Saints in heaven what becommeth of their dead corpse on earth, no more than it concerneth a newly elected King, when hee hath his Princely robes on him, what becomes of his old cast suits of apparrell: in which regard SaintAug. confes. l. 9. c. 11. Nihil longé est à Deo, nec ti∣mendum mihi ille ne ag∣noscat in fine saeculi unde resuscitet. Monica told her sonne at her death, that shee tooke no care where shee was interred; yeelding this for a reason, It is no∣thing to mee (saith shee) whether I lye farre from home, or from any Church; I am sure nothing is farre from God: neither doe I feare but that hee will find mee at the last day, and raise up my corpse wheresoever it lies. Yet because the bodies of Gods Saints were temples of the holy Ghost, and
served as instruments in the performance of all duties of piety and chari∣ty; our piety and charity in some respect extendeth to them: piety I say, not to worship them, for that is idolatrie; not to pray to them, for that at the best is , will-worship, and unwarrantable devotion; not to pray for them, for that is superstition: but to give God thankes for them, and to expect their and our joyfull resurrection: charity to preserve their good name alive, and to bury their dead corpses, although I grant with SaintLib. 1. de ci¦vit. Dei, c. 12. Omnia ista curatio funeris, conditio se∣pultuae pom∣pa exequia∣um mgis sun solatia vivorum quàm subsidia mor∣tuorum. Et c. 13. Si enim paterna vestis & annulus tan∣tò charior est posteris, quan∣tò erga paren∣tes major est affectus, nullo modo spernan∣da sunt corpo∣ra, quae utique multo familia∣rius atque con∣junctius quàm quaelibet indu∣menta gesta∣mus. Austine, that the care of funeralls, and pompe of herses, and rites of buriall are rather comforts of the living, than helpes of the dead: yet with the same Austine I cannot but acknowledge that the bodies of our parents or friends may challenge more affection and respect to them, than the appar∣rell ring, or jewell they wore, which yet wee make great account of, and carefully keep for their sake. Doth not Nature her selfe teach us this worke of mercy to the dead? Doe not some birds that are loving to man, if they spy a dead corpse in the wood, cover it over with leaves? Doth the young Phenix (asAnnal. l. 10. Phoenici cura primo sepeli∣endi patris, sublato myr∣rhae pondere subit patrium corpus, & in Solis templum perfert. Tacitus writeth) as soone as ever it hath life, take care of burying the parent, carrying his corpse with a quantity of Myrrhe, and laying it in the Temple of the Sunne? and shall not men endued with reason and understanding doe the like not onely to their parents and friends, but even to strangers and their very enemies, especially if there bee worth in them? Alexander the great opening Cyrus Tombe, set a crowne upon his Herse, and carefully shut it a∣gaine. Hannibal gave Marcellus the Romane Consull an honourable buriall, put his ashes in a silver pot, and crowned it with a crowne of gold, and sent it to his sonne to interre it. (To speake nothing of Cannibals, man-eaters, and other savages) all civill people in the world bury their dead, though in a different manner, and with severall rites. The Jewes washed, the Egyptians embalmed the corpse, the Ro∣manes burnt them with sweet perfumes, and kept the ashes in an urne or pot: the Ethiopians curiously paint them, and lay them in a gla∣zed coffin: the most common and most agreeable to Scripture is inter∣ring the corpse. Moses alludeth to it:Gen 3.19. Dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou returne: and Solomon,Eccles. 12.7. Then shall the dust returne to the earth as it was: and David,Psal. 30.9. What profit is there then in my bloud when I goe downe to the pit? shall the dust praise thee? or shall it declare thy truth? The Greekes for the most part, and other Nations also, excepting those above named, interred their dead: and thereforePlin nat. hist. l. 2. c. 63. Haec nascentes exci∣pit, natos alit novissimè complexa gre∣mio jam reli∣quà naturà ab∣dicatos, tum maximé ut mater operi∣ens, nomen prorogat tiu∣lis, &c. Pliny calleth the earth our tender mother, which receiveth us into her bosome, when wee are excluded as it were out of the world, and covereth our nakednesse and shame, and guardeth us from beasts and fowles, that they offer no in∣dignity to our carkasses. Now because it is to small purpose to bestow the dead in roomes un∣der ground, if they may not keep them, Abraham wisely provided for this: for hee laid downe a valuable consideration for the field where the cave was. Were laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a summe of money. As Abraham here bought a field out-right, and thereby assured the pos∣session thereof to his posterity; so by his example the Synagogue un∣der
the Law, and the Catholike Church under the Gospel, especially in dayes of peace, secured certaine places for the buriall of the dead, either purchased for money, or received by deed of gift: and after they were possessed of them, sequestred them from all other, and appropiated them to this use onely; by which sequestration and appropriation all such parcells of ground became holy, in such sort that none might otherwise use or imploy them, than for the buriall of the dead, without sacriledge or profanation. As the holy oyle ran from Aarons head to his body, and the skirts of his garments, so holinesse stayeth not in the Chancell as the head, but descendeth to the whole body of the Church and the Church-yard as the skirt thereof. Mistake mee not, brethren, I say not that one clod of earth is holier than another, or any one place or day absolutely, but relatively only. For as it is superstition to attribute formall or inherent holinesse to times, places, parcells of ground, fruits of the earth, vessell, or vestments; so it is pro∣fanenesse to deny them some kind of relative sanctity, which the holy Ghost attributeth unto them in Scripture, where wee reade expresly of holy ground, holy daies, holy oyle, and the like. To cleare the point wee are to distinguish of holinesse yet more particularly, which belongeth 1. To God the Father, Sonne, and Spirit by essence. 2. To Angels and men by participation of the divine nature or grace. 3. To the Word and Oracles of God by inspiration. 4. To types, figures, sacraments, rites and ceremonies by divine institution. 5. To places, lands, and fruits of the earth, as also sacred utensils, by use and dedication: as 1. Temples with their furniture consecrated to the ser∣vice of God. 2. Tithes and glebe lands to the maintenance of the Priests. 3. Church-yards to the buriall of the dead. Others come off shorter, and dichotomize holy things, which say they are 1. Sanctified, because they are holy, as God his name and attri∣butes, &c. 2. Holy, because they are sanctified, 1. Either by God to man, as the Word and Sacraments. 2. Or by man to God, as Priests, Temples, Altars, Ta∣bles, &c. Of this last kind of holy things by dedication, some are dedicated to him 1. Immediately, as all things used in his service. 2. Mediately, as all such things without which his service cannot be conveniently done; and here come in Church-yards, without which, some religious workes of charity cannot be done with such conveniency or decency as they ought.
The Church is as Gods house, and the yard is as the court before his doore: how then dare any defile it, or alienate it, or imploy it to any secu∣lar use for profit or pleasure? To conclude, all Church-yards by the Ancients are termed , dormitories, or dortories, wherein they lye that sleep in Jesus. Now it is most uncivill to presse into, or any way abuse the bed-chamber of the li∣ving, and much more of the dead. What are graves in this dormitory but sacred vestries, wherein we lay up our old garments for a time, and after take them out, and resume them new dressed and trimmed, and gloriously adorned, and made shining, andMar. 9.3. exceeding white as snow (so as no Ful∣ler on earth can white them?) These shining raiments God be∣stow upon us all at the last day, for the merits of the death and buriall of our Lord and Saviour. Cui, &c.
THE FEAST OF PENTECOST. A Sermon preached on Whitsunday. THE LXIII. SERMON. ATCS 2.1. And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all together with one accord in one place. SAintHom. in die ascens. . Chrysostome, comparing the works of redemption with the works of creation, observeth, that as the Fa∣ther finished the former, so the Sonne the later, in six dayes especially: in memorie whereof his dearest Spouse, the Catholique Church, hath appointed six solemnities to be kept by all Christians, with greatest fervour of devotion, and highest elevation of religi∣ous affections. These are Christ his 1. Virgin birth. 2. Illustrious Epiphanie. 3. Ignominious death. 4. His powerfull resurrection. 5. His glorious ascension. 6. His gracious sending downe of the holy Ghost.
The day of 1. His incarnation, by which he entred into the world. 2. His manifestation, on which he entred upon his office of Mediatour. 3. His passion, on which he expiated our sinnes. 4. His resuscitation, by wch he conquered death & the grave. 5. His triumphant returne into heaven, on which hee tooke seizin and possession of that kingdome for us. 6. His visible mission of the holy Ghost, in the similitude of fiery cloven tongues, on which he sealed all his former benefits to us, and us to the day of redemption. This last festivall in order of time was yet the first and chiefest in order of dignity. For on Christs birth day hee was made partaker of our nature, but on this wee were made partakers after a sort of his: in the Epiphany one starre onely stood over the house where hee lay, on this twelve fiery tongues, like so many celestiall lights, appeared in the roome where the Apostles were assembled: on the day of his passion he rendred his humane spirit to God his father, on this hee sent downe his divine spirit upon us: on the resurrection his spirit quickened his naturall body, on this it quic∣kened his mysticall, the Catholique Church: on the ascension he tooke a pledge from us, viz. our flesh, and carried it into heaven, on this hee sent us his pledge, viz. his spirit in the likenesse of fiery tongues, with the sound of a mighty rushing wind. After which the Spouse, as Gorrhan conceiveth, pan∣ted, saying,Cant. 4.16. Awake, O North wind, and come thou South, blow upon my gar∣den, that the spices therof may flow out; let my Beloved come into his garden, & eat his pleasant fruits. The wind she gasped for, what was it but the spirit? and what are the fragrant spices shee wishes may flow, but the graces of the holy Ghost, which David calleth gifts for men in the eighteenth verse of the 68. Psalme? the former part whereof may furnish the feast we lately celebrated, with a fit antheme, Thou hast ascended up on high, thou hast led captivitie captive: the later may supply this present, thou hast received gifts for men, yea for the rebellious also, that the Lord God may dwell among them. Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation: for on this day Christ received gifts for his Church, the gifts of faith, hope and charitie, the gift of prayer and supplication, the gift of healing and miracles, the gift of prophecie, the gift of tongues, and the in∣terpretation thereof. Verily, so many and so great are the benefits, which the anniversary returne of this day presenteth to us, that as if all the tongues upon the earth had not beene sufficient to utter them, a supply of new tongues was sent from heaven to declare them in all languages. The new Testament was drawne before, and signed with Christs bloud on good Friday; butEphes. 4.30.

In their minds, by infallible direction: 2. In their tongues, by the multiplicity of languages: 3. In their hands, by miraculous cures. S. Austine truly observeth, that before the Apostles on this day were indued with power from above, they never strove for the Christian faith unto bloud: when Satan winnowed them at Christs passion they all flew away like chaffe. And though S. Peters faith failed not, because it was sup∣ported by our Lords prayer, Luke 22.32. yet his courage failed him in such sort, that he was foyled by a silly damsell: but after the holy Ghost descended upon him and the rest of the Apostles, in the sound of a mightie rushing wind, and in the likenesse of fierie cloven tongues, they were filled with grace, and enflamed with zeale, and they mightily opposed all the enemies of the truth, and made an open and noble profession thereof before the greatest Potentates of the world, and sealed it with their bloud, all of them save S. John; who had that priviledge that hee should stay till Christ came, glorifying the Lord of life by their valiant suffering of death for his names sake. In regard of which manifold and powerfull effcts of sending the spirit on this day, which were no lesse seene in the flames of the Mar∣tyrs, than in the fiery tongues that lighted on the Apostles, the Church of Christ, even from the beginning, celebrated this festivity in most solemne manner; and not so onely, but within 300. yeares after Christs death, the Fathers in the Councels ofConcil. Elib. c. 43. Cuncti diem Penteco∣stes celebrent, qui non fece∣rit quasi no∣vam heresem induxerit pu∣matur. Eliberis mounted a canon, thundring out the paine of heresie to all such as religiously kept it not. If the Jewes celebrated an high feast in memory of the Law, on this day first proclaimed on mount Sinai; ought not we much more to solemnize it in memory of the Gospel now promulgated on mount Sion by new tongues sent from heaven? If we dedi peculiar festivals to God the Father the Creatour, and God the Sonne the Redeemer; why should not God the holy Ghost the Sancti∣fier have a peculiar interest in our devotion? S.Serm. in die Pent. Si cele∣bramus san∣ctorum solen∣nia, quanto magis ejus à quo habue∣runt ut sancti essent, quot∣quot fuerunt sancti? si vene∣ramur sanctifi∣catos, quanto magis sanctifi∣catorem? Bernard addeth another twist to this cord, If we deservedly honour Saints with festivals, how much more ought wee to honour him, who maketh them Saints? especially having so good a ground for it, as is laid downe in this chapter and verse: And when the day of Pentecost was come. As a prologue to an act, or an eeve to an holy day, or the Parascheve to the Passeover, or the beautifull gate to the Temple; so is this preface to the ensuing narration: it presen∣teth to our religious thoughts a three-fold concurrence:
1. Of time. 2. Of place. 3. Of affections. Upon one and the selfe same day, when all the Apostles were met in one place, and were of one minde, the spirit of unity and love descendeth upon them. Complementum legis Christus, Evangelii spiritus; As the descending of the Sonne was the complement of the Law, so the sending of the spirit is the complement of the Gospel: and as God sent his Sonne in the fulnesse of time, so he sent the spirit, , in the fulnesse of the fiftieth day. When the Apostles number was full, and their desire and expectations full, then the spirit came downe, and filled their hearts with joy, and their tongues with , Magnifica Dei facta, the wonderfull works of God, vers. 11.

In the Syriacke and Latine wee read  or dies, dayes, in the plurall number: but in the originall, , the day in the singular. The Syriacke and the Latine had an eye to the whole number of dayes, which now amounted unto fiftie: the origi∣nall designeth in the singular the precise day which made it up fiftie, the day by the accesse whereof to the 49. the number of , or fiftie, was made complete. Word for word according to the originall wee should thus reade my text, , in or upon the fulfilling of the fiftieth day from the feast of first fruits. Metall upon metall is no good He∣raldrie; yet feast upon feast is good Divinitie: especially when the one is the type, the other the truth. For this reason. Severianus conceiveth that our Saviour was offered up for our sinnes on the crosse, the day and time of the day when the Paschall Lamb, according to the Law, was to be killed, to set the face to the picture, the truth to the type, that the body might as it were drive out the shadow, and occupie the space thereof. And in like mannerIn haec ver∣ba, ut ostende∣ret & tum spi∣ritum sanctum legem tulisse, & nunc legem ferre. Theophylact imagineth that hee sent the spirit fiftie dayes after, when the Jewes kept a feast for the Law, to shew that as then the holy Ghost proclaimed the Law, so now also: then the law and covenant of works, now the law of faith and covenant of grace.

Austine giveth another rellish of his owne; As (saith he) fiftie dayes after Easter the Law was given, writ∣ten by the finger of God in tables of stone: so the spirit, whose office it is to write it in the hearts of men, just so many dayes after Christs resurrection, who
is our Passover, fulfilled that which was figured in the publishing of the Law. S.Chrys. hom. de Pent. , &c. Chrysostome striketh upon a different string, yet maketh good musicke: others fetched the congruitie from the Law, hee from nature. What, saith he, is Pentecost? It signifieth that season of the yeare, wherein the Jewes thrust their sickle into the corne-harvest. In like sort the Lord of the harvest disposed that now the Apostles should put their sickle (the sickle of the Word) into the harvest of the world and reape it. I shall not need to straine farther for con∣gruities, S. Cyrill and S. Ambrose give me the hint of another synchronisme; for they affirme that on this day the Angell descended into the poole of Be∣thesda, and after the troubling the water cured the sicke whatsoever the disease was. And what fitter day could have beene thought upon for the holy Ghost to descend, to bestow the gift of miraculous cures, than upon this day of healing? I could tell you of the Jubilee, which fell upon the fiftieth yeare, in which all possessions returned to their former owners, and acquit∣tances were given for all debts: but because the best stomacks rather desire solid than sweet meats, I therefore content my selfe at this present withCalv. com. in Act. 2. Festo die quo ingens multitudo Hierosolymae confluere so∣lebat, editum est miraculum quo illustrius redderetur. Calvin his observation upon the circumstance of time. This solemnitie being next to that of the Passover, was the fittest time to make the miracle wrought upon it more illustrious. For this reason Christ came up so often to Jerusalem at their solemne feasts, and S. Paul made haste in his journey that he might be there at the feast of Pentecost, to win more soules by the preaching of the Gospel, in a time of so great confluence of people from all parts. There is no fishing to the sea, and now it was full sea at Jerusalem, all the cities in Palestine like so many rivers emptying themselves into it. The gift of tongues could not at any time so fitly have been bestowed as at this, when there were present at Jerusalem men of everie nation under heaven, Acts 2.5, 6. To convince all gaine-sayers of the miracle, What are these (say they) that speak? Are they not Galileans? How then heare we every one speake in our owne tongue where wee were borne? Parthians, and Medes, and Ela∣mites, and they that dwell in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Bithynia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Aegypt, and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jewes and Proselytes, Cretes and Arabians, we doe heare them speake in our tongues the wonderfull works of God, vers. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, As we read in the 19. Psalme, vers. 2. Dies ad diem eructat sermonem, & nox ad noctem ostendit scientiam; Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge, or giveth in∣telligence: so here, Lingua ad linguam eructat sermonem: the tongues of men of all nations gave testimony to the miraculous gift of tongues in the Apostles. It is the wisdome of State, to appoint beacons to be set up on the highest hils, to give notice to all the Countrey. And Christ himselfe com∣mandeth us not to hide a candle under a bushell, but to set it on a candlesticke, that it may give light to all that are in the house. And in this consideration those Preachers of the glad tidings of salvation, who have had the best foyle of modestie to set off the lustre of their knowledge, have yet been de∣sirous to deliver their Embassage from God to men in the fullest assem∣blies: not to gaine thereby more applause to themselves, but more soules to God. When the eares stand thicke in a corne-field, not a drop of raine falleth besides them on the ground. And this is a principall end of our
celebration of Christian feasts, to draw multitudes together to heare Christ preaching by his Ministers, and working still miraculous cures upon the soules of men, by the Sacraments administred in the Church. And so from the holy day, I proceed to the sacred persons assembled on it, viz. the Apostles. They were all together. Beza telleth us of an ancient manuscript, in which he found the substantive added to the adjective omnes, viz. Apostoli, which words though I finde not in our copies, yet by comparing this verse with the last of the former chapter, it appeareth that the all here must bee re∣strained to the Apostles, or principally meant of them; for they were, as S. Austine setteth themAug. serm. de Pent. Tan∣quam duode∣cim radii solis, seu totidem lampades veri∣tatis totum mundum illu∣minantes. forth, twelve beames of the sunne of righteousnesse, or twelve great torches of the truth enlightening the whole world. They were as the twelve Patriarks of the new Testament, to be consecrated as oecu∣menicall Pastours throughout all the earth: they were as theExod. 15.27. twelve Wels of water in Elim, from whence the chrystall streames of the water of life were to be derived into all parts: they were as the twelveApoc. 12.1. starres in the crowne of the woman which was cloathed with the sunne, and the moone under her feet: and as the twelveApoc. 21.14. pretious stones in the foundation of the celestiall Jerusalem. The present assembly in this upper roome was no other than a sacred Synod; and in truth there can be no Synod where the Apostles or their suc∣cessours are not present, and Presidents. For all assemblies, how great soe∣ver, of Lay-persons, called together about ordering ecclesiasticall affaires, without Bishops and Pastours, are like to Polyphemus his vast body with∣out an eye: Monstrum horrendum informe ingens cui lumen ademptum. But when the Apostles and their successours, Bishops, and Prelates, and Doctours of the Church are assembled, and all are of one accord, and bend their endevours one way, to settle peace and define truth, Christ will make good his promise, to be in theMatt. 18.20. When two or three are ga∣thered toge∣ther in my name, there am I in the middest of them. And, middest of them, and by his spirit to lead them intoJohn 16.13. When the spi∣rit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth. all truth. With one accord. All the ancient and later Interpreters accord in their note upon the word accord, that Animorum unio & concordia est optima dispositio ad recipiendum Spiritum sanctum: that Unitie and concord is the best disposition of the minde, & preparation for the receiving of the holy Ghost. The bones in Ezekiel wereEzek. 37.7, 8. joyned one to another and tyed with sinewes, before the wind blew upon them and revived them: so the members of Christ must bee joyned in love, and coupled with the sinewes of charita∣ble affections one towards another, before the holy Spirit will enlive them. Marke (saith S.Serm. de Temp. Mem∣brum amputa∣tum non se∣quitur spiritus: cùm in corpo∣re erat vive∣bat, precisum amittit spiri∣tum. Austine) in the naturall body, how if a member bee cut off, the soule presently leaveth it; while it was united to the rest of the mem∣bers it lived, but as soone as ever it was severed, it became a dead peece of flesh: so it is in the mysticall body of Christ; those who sever themselves by schisme or faction from the body and their fellow-members, deprive them∣selves of the influence of the holy Spirit. Peruse the records of the Church, and you shall finde for the most part that faction hath bred heresie. When discontented Church-men of eminent parts sided against their Bishops and Superiours, Gods spirit left them, and they became authours of damnable
heresies. This was Novatus his case after hee made a faction against Cy∣prian: Donatus after hee made a faction against Meltiades: Aerius after hee made a schisme against Eustatius: and doe we not see it daily in our Se∣paratists, who no sooner leave our Church, but the spirit of God quite leaveth them, and they fall from Brownisme to Anabaptisme, from Ana∣baptisme to Familisme, and into what not? The Church and Common-wealth, like thePlin. l. 2. nat. hist. c. 105. Lapis Tyr∣rhenus grandis innatat, com∣minutus mer∣gitur. Lapis Tyrrhenus, while they are whole swimme in all wa∣ters; but if they be broken into factions, or crumbled into sects & schismes, they will soone sinke, if not drowne. And so I passe,  from their unanimitie of affection, to their concurrence in place. In one place. The last circumstance is the place, which was an upper chamber in Jerusalem. The Apostles and Disciples stayed at Jerusalem after the ascension of our Lord, partly in obedience to hisActs 1.4. command, which was not to depart out of Jerusalem till they were indued with power from above: partly to fulfill the prophecie, theEsay 2.3. Law shall goe out of Sion, and the word of God out of Jerusalem. They kept all together out of love, and for more safetie; and they tooke an upper chamber that they might bee more private and retired, or because in regard of the great confluence of people at this feast, they could not hire the whole house: or as Bernar∣dinus conceiveth, to teach us that the spirit ofCom. in Act. Ut discamus quod datur spiritus iis qui se ab imis at∣tollunt, & rerū sublimium contemplati∣one ut cibo se oblectant. God is given to such as raise up themselves from the earth, and give themselves to the contemplation of high and heavenly mysteries. Now to descend from this higher chamber, and to come neare to you by some application of this text: It will be to little purpose to heare of the Apostles preparation this day, if wee prepare not our selves accor∣dingly: to discourse of their entertainment, and receiving the holy Spirit, if wee receive him not into our hearts. It is a mockerie, as Fulgentius hath it, Ejus diem celebrare, cujus lucem oderimus, To keepe the day of the Spirit, if wee hate his light. If wee desire to celebrate the feast of the Spirit, and by his grace worthily receive the Sacrament of Christ his flesh, wee must imitate the Apostles and Disciples in each circumstance. 1. Rely upon Gods promises by a lively faith, of sending the spirit of his Sonne into our hearts, and patiently expect the accomplishment of it many dayes as they did. 2. Ascend into an upper chamber, that is, remove our selves as farre as wee can from the earth, and set our affections upon those things that are above. 3. Meet in one place, that is the Church; to frequent the house of God, and when we are bid, not to make excuses, but to present our selves at the Lords boord. 4. Not onely meet in one place, but as the Apostles did with one ac∣cord, to reconcile all differences among our selves, and to purge out all gall of malice, and in an holy sympathy of devotion, to joyne sighs with sighs, and hearts with hearts, and hands with hands, and lifting up all to∣gether with one accord, sing, Come holy Ghost: so as this day is Pentecost, in like manner this place shall be as the upper roome where they were as∣sembled, and we as the Apostles and Disciples, and the Word which hath now beene preached unto us, as the sound of that mightie rushing wind which
filled that roome: and after wee have worthily celebrated the feast of the Spirit, and administred the Sacrament of our Lords body and bloud, wee shall feele the effects of both in us: viz. more light in our understanding, more warmth in our affections, more fervour in our devotions, more com∣fort in our afflictions, more strength in temptations, more growth in grace, more settled peace of conscience, and unspeakable joy in the holy Ghost: To whom with the Father and the Sonne bee ascribed, &c.
THE SYMBOLE OF THE SPIRIT. THE LXIV. SERMON. ACTS 2.2. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. SAint Luke in the precedent verse giveth us the name, & in this the ground of the solemne feast we are now come to celebrate, with such religious rites as our Church hath prescribed, according to the presidents of the first and best ages. The name is , the feast of the fiftieth day from Easter; the ground thereof the miraculous apparition, and (if I may so speake) the Epiphany of the holy Spirit in the sound of a mighty rushing wind, & the light of fiery clo∣ven tongues shining on the heads of the Apostles, who stayed at Jerusalem, according to our Lords command, in expectation of the promise of the holy Ghost, which was fulfilled then in their eyes, and now in our eares, and I hope also in our hearts. After God the Father had manifested himselfe by the worlds creation, and the workes of nature, and God the Sonne by his incarnation, and the workes of grace; it was most convenient, that in the third place the third person should manifest himselfe, as he did this day by visible descension, and workes of wonder. Before in the third of Matthew at the Epiphany of our Saviour, the Spirit appeared in the likenesse of a dove; but here (as yee heare) in the similitude of fiery cloven tongues, to teach us, that we ought to be like doves, without gall in prosecution of injury done to our selves; but like Seraphins, all fire, in vindicating Gods honour. This morall interpretation SaintGreg. tert. pas. Omnes quos implet, & columbae sim∣plicitate man∣suetos, & igne zeli ardentes exhibet. Et ib. Intus arsit ignibus amoris, & foras accensus est zelo severitatis: causam populi apud Deum lachrymis, causam Dei apud populum gladiis allegabat, &c. Gregory makes of these mysticall appari∣tions:
All whom the spirit fills he maketh meeke by the simplicity of doves, and yet burning with the fire of zeale. Just of this temper was Moses, who took somewhat of the dove from the spirit, and somewhat of the fire. For being warme within with the fire of love, and kindling without with the zeale of severity, he pleaded the cause of the people before God with teares, but the cause of God before the people with swords. Sed sufficit diei suum o∣pus, sufficient for the day will be the worke thereof: sufficient for this au∣dience will be the interpretation of the sound: the mysticall exposition of the wind which filled the house where the Apostles sate, will fill up this time. And lest my meditations upon this wind should passe away like wind, I will fasten upon two points of speciall observation, 1. The object vehement, the sound of a mighty rushing wind. 2. The effect correspondent, filled the whole house. Each part is accompanied with circumstances: 1. With the circumstance of 1. The manner, suddenly. 2. The sourse or terminus à quo, from heaven. 2. With the circumstance of 1. The place, the house where: 2. The persons, they: 3. Their posture, were sitting. 1. Hearken suddenly, there came on the sudden. 2. To what? a sound. 3. From whence? from heaven. 4. What manner of sound? as of a mighty rushing wind. 5. Where? filling the roome where they were sitting. That suddenly when they were all quiet there should come a sound or noise, and that from heaven, and that such a vehement sound as of a mighty rushing wind, and that it should fill the whole roome where they were, and no place else, seemes to mee a kind of sequence of miracles. Every word in this Text is like a cocke, which being turned, yeeldeth abundance of the water of life, of which we shall taste hereafter. I observe first in generall, that the Spirit presented himselfe both to the eyes and to the eares of the Apostles: to the eares, in a noise like a trumpet to proclaime him: to the eyes, in the shape of tongues like lights to shew him. Next I observe, that as there were two sacred signes of Christs body, 1. Bread, 2. Wine. so there are two symboles, and (if I may so speake) sacraments of the Spirit: 1. Wind, 2. Fire. Behold the correspondency between them; the spirit is of a nobler and more celestiall nature than a body: in like manner, the elements of wind and fire come neerer the nature of heaven than bread and wine, which are of a more materiall and earthly nature. And as the elements sort with the my∣steries they represent, so also with our senses to which they are presented.
For the grosser and more materiall elements, bread and wine, are exhibited to our grosser and more carnall senses, the taste and touch: but the subtiler and lesse materiall, wind and fire, to our subtiler and more spirituall senses, the eyes and eares. Of the holy formes of bread and wine, their significan∣cie and efficacy, I have heretofore discoursed at large; at this present by the assistance of the holy Spirit I will spend my breath upon the sacred wind in my Text; and hereafter, when God shall touch my tongue with a fiery coale from his Altar, explicate the mystery of the fiery cloven tongues. After the nature and number of the symboles, their order in the third place commeth to be considered: first, the Apostles heare a sound, and then they see the fiery cloven tongues. And answerable hereunto in the fourth verse we reade, that they were filled with the holy Ghost, and then they began to speake with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. ForMat. 12.34. out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. With theRom. 10.10. heart man beleeveth unto righteousnesse, and then with the tongue he confesseth unto salvation. MyPsal. 45.1. heart (saith David) is enditing a good matter, and my tongue is the pen of a ready writer: first the heart enditeth, and then the tongue writeth. They who stay not at Jerusalem till they are endued with power from above, and receive the promise of the Father, but presently will open their mouthes, and try to loosen the strings of their fiery tongues; I meane, they who continue not in the schooles of the Prophets, till they have learned the languages and arts, and have used the ordinary meanes to obtaine the gifts and graces of the holy Spirit, and yet will open their mouthes in the Pulpit, and exer∣cise the gift of their tongues, doe but fill the eares of their auditors with a sound, and their zealous fiery cloven tongues serve but to put fire, and make a rent in the Church of God. The organ pipes must bee filled with wind before the instrument give any sound: our mouthes, lips, and tongues are the instruments and organs of God, and before they are filled with the wind in my Text, they cannot sound out , his wonderous workes, whereof this is one, as followeth: And suddenly, . Every circumstance, like graines in gold scales, ad∣deth to the weight.Oecumen. in Act. c. 2 . Oecumenicus conceiveth that this sound came on the sudden to scare the Apostles, and out of feare or amazement to draw them to∣gether. And indeed this sudden noise in this upper roome, the Apostles sit∣ting still, and there being no wind abroad stirring, seemeth not lesse strange than the sudden calme after Christ rebuked theMat. 8.26. wind and the sea. Windes are not raised to the height on the sudden, but grow more and more blu∣stering by degrees: this became blustering on the sudden, and, which is more strange, it was , quasi , from  privative, and , appareo, without any cause appearing. To heare a thunder clap in summer, when we see a blacke cloud overcasting the whole skie; or a report, where we know there is a canon mounted, no way amazeth us: but to heare thundering in a cleere sun-shine, when there is no cloud to be seen in all the skie; or the re∣port like that of a canon, where there is no peece of ordnance; or a sudden light in a darke roome, without lamp, candle, torch, or fire, somewhat af∣frighteth and amazeth us: so it was here, a noise is heard as of a mighty ru∣shing wind, yet no wind; or if a wind, a wind created of nothing, without any cause or prejacent matter. There is a great controversie among the
Philosophers about the causes of winds. Some, as Democritus imagined, that many atomes, that is, such small bodies and motes as wee see in the beames of the Sunne meeting together, and striving for place, stirred the aire, and thereby made winds: others, as Agrippa, that the evill spirits ru∣ling in the aire, as they raise tempests, so also they cause winds. Aristotle en∣deavoureth to demonstrate that the rising up of dry exhalations from the earth generateth the winds, which so long rage as the matter continueth, after that faileth the wind lies. The Divines resolve withPsal. 135.7. David, that God draweth them out of his hidden treasures. To which our Saviour seemeth to have reference: TheJohn 3.8. wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but knowest not whence it commeth, that is, originally: There came a sound. Some will have this sound to bee an eccho, or a sound at second hand, because so it will bee a fitter embleme of the Apo∣stles preaching to the people, and ours to you. For first, the sound of the Gospel comes from God to us, and then it rebounds from us to you: but the word in the originall is not , an eccho, but , a sound: besides, the eccho comes by reverberation from below, but this sound came from a∣bove. From heaven. Lorinus and other Commentatours are of opinion, that heaven here, as in many other Texts of Scripture, is put for the aire: as God is said toGen. 7.11. open the windowes of heaven, and to raine fire andGen. 19.24. brimstone from heaven. But I see no reason why  here may not signifie the efficient cause, and heaven bee taken properly. For though the sense of hearing judged it, that the sound began but in the aire, yet it was there made with∣out any apparent cause: and why may not this sound be as well from hea∣ven properly, as we reade of a voice from heaven, saying,Mat. 3.17. This is my well be∣loved Sonne in whom I am well pleased: and another voice from heaven, say∣ing,John 12.28. I have both glorified it (my name) and will glorifie it againe: and yet a third voice from heaven, saying, Blessed are theRev. 14 13. dead which dye in the Lord? But what manner of sound was this? As of a rushing mighty wind, or rather a rushing blast. For in the origi∣nall it is , not , ruentis flatus, not venti. As our breath dif∣fereth from our spirit and breathing parts, so the spirit which the Apostles received, was not the holy Ghost himselfe the third person, but some ex∣traordinary gifts and graces of the spirit. Though Peter Lumbard the great Master of the sentences seemed to encline to that opinion, that the Apo∣stles received the very person of the holy Ghost; yet this conceit of his is pricked through with an obelisque, and à magistro hic non tenetur by the later Schoolmen, who rightly distinguish between the substance of the spi∣rit and the gifts. The infinite substance neither is nor can bee imparted to any creature, but the finite graces, whereof they were only capable. The Law & the Gospel both came to the eares of men by a sound, the one from Sinai, the other from Sion; that was delivered in thundering & lightening, with darknesse and an earth-quake, this in a sound of a gale of wind, and in the likenesse of shining tongues, the Apostles sitting still, the place being filled, but not shooke with the blast. As in lessons skilfully pricked, the musicall notes answer to the matter of the ditty; so the manner of the pub∣lishing of the Law and Gospel was correspondent to the matter contained
in them; that was proclaimed in a dreadfull manner, this in a comfortable. For theRom. 4.15. Law worketh wrath, but the Gospel peace: the Law feare, the Go∣spel hope: the Law an obscure, the Gospel a more cleere and evident knowledge: according to that sacred aphorisme of Saint Ambrose, Umbra in Lege, imago in Evangelio, veritas in coelo; there was a shadow in the Law, an image in the Gospel, the truth it selfe in heaven. Moses himselfe quaked at the giving of the Law, but we reade not that the Apostles were terrified, but exceedingly comforted at the receiving of the Gospel: as the roome was filled with the blast, so their hearts with joy. And it filled the place where they were sitting. The Apostles expected the fulfilling of Christs promise, and it is very likely that they were pray∣ing on their knees: yet they might be truly said , which our tran∣slators render sitting. For the word in the originall importeth only a settled abode, as it is taken in the verse following, There appeared cloven tongues like fire, , and it sate upon each of them. Sitting (as the word is taken in our language) is a kind of posture of mans body, which cannot be imagined either in fire, or tongues: the meaning therefore is no more, than it abode or rested on them. Thus have I peeled the barke, let us now sucke the juice: we have viewed the engraving on the outside of the cup, let us now drinke the celestiall li∣quor, and rellish the spirituall meaning couched under the letter. The la∣ter Commentatours for the most part (like Apothecaries boyes) gather the broad leaves and white flowers that are found on the top of the water; but the ancient (like skilfull Indians) dive deep to the bottome, and from thence take up pearles. 1. They observe that God useth signes to strike our senses, thereby to stirre us up, that we may give more heed to that which he then fore-warn∣eth us of, or at the present worketh in us. Of signes in Scripture wee find three sorts: 1. Irae, of Gods anger, as extraordinary earth-quakes, fire and brimstone falling from heaven, and other prodigious events. 2. Potentiae, of his power, or rather omnipotency, as miracles. 3. Gratiae, of grace and favour, and these were 1. Significantia tantum, such as signified, or prefigured grace only, as types. 2. Obsignantia, such as seale unto us, and actually exhi∣bit grace, as sacraments. The first sort are praeter naturam, the second contra naturam, the third supra naturam. The signes here were transeunt only, as the burningExod. 3.2. bush, & theMat. 3.16. dove in the likenesse whereof the spirit descended; and therefore could not be sa∣craments in the proper acception of the word: yet are they to be reduced to the third kind of signes, signa gratiae. Strange accidents for the most part fore-shew strange events: and as many signes are miraculous, so many miracles are significant. In Sicilie the sea water began to sweeten a little be∣fore the deposing the cruell tyrantPlin. nat. hist. l. 2. c. 97. Eo die quo pulsus est Dionysius regno, mare dulcescebat in portu. Dionysius: in like manner Domitian drea∣med that he saw a head of gold rise up upon the nape of his necke, which fore-shewed that a better head of that Monarchy should succeed him. Be∣fore
the civill war between Caesar & Pompey, there were seen twoPlin. l. 2. nat. hist. c. 83. In agro Muti∣nensi duo montes inter se concurre∣bant crepitu maximo assul∣tantes. moun∣taines running one at the other in the field of Mutina; and to shew that Cae∣sar should have the better at the beginning of the warre, there grew in the Capitoll on the sudden a laurell tree at the foot of his statue. Before the destruction of Jerusalem, there was seen a starre in the skie likeJoseph. de bel. Jud. l. 7. c. 12. Supra civita∣tem stetit sy∣dus simile gladio, & per annum perse∣veravit. a drawne sword, perpendicularly hanging over the City. And not to build upon the sandy foundation of humane Histories, the sacred Story affordeth the like. Before the true bread descended from heaven, Manna rained from heaven upon the Israelites. The water issuing out of the rocke that was strucke, fore-shewed the fountaine for sinne and uncleannesse, which was opened, when the side of Christ the true rocke was struck and pierced by the speare of the souldier: the drowning of Pharaoh and all his host in the red sea, the destruction of the Divell and all our ghostly enemies in the bloud of our Redeemer: the going backe of the Sunne in the diall of Ahaz, the set∣ting backe the finger in the diall of Hezekiahs life: the appearing of a new starre to the Sages, the rising of a new light in the world, to lighten the Gen∣tiles, and to be the glory of the people Israel: the eclipse of the Sunne at Christs death, the obscuration of the divine majesty in the Sonne of God for a time: the great draught of fish which Saint Peter tooke after Christs resurrection, the happy successe of him and the rest of the Apostles, who were fishers of men, and caught many thousands at one draught in the net of the Gospel. There fell scales from S. Pauls eyes, before God drew from the eyes of his understanding the filme of ignorance and blind zeale: and here, before the Apostles were filled with the holy Ghost, and spake with di∣vers tongues, the roome where they aboad was filled with a mighty rushing wind, and there appeared in the aire fiery cloven tongues. But what did the suddennesse of it betoken? Suddenly. The Fathers read three lectures upon this circumstance, teach∣ing that the motions and operations of the Spirit are 1. Speedy, 2. Free, 3. Come and gone in an instant. The first is read us by St. Ambrose, Spiritus nescit tarda molimina, the Spi∣rit is quicke in operation. As the lightening passeth in an instant from East to West, because it findeth no resistance; so the worke of grace in the heart is suddenly done, especially for the reason given by St. Austine, Because no hard heart can repell or refuse it: for the first worke of grace is to take away the stone out of the heart; which being taken away, it presently receiveth the Spi∣rits impressions. Who more averse from the Christian faith than St. Paul? yet in an instant by a vision from heaven he is changed from persecuting Saul to preaching Paul. At one Sermon of St. Peter many thousand soules were gained. And in Dioclesians time, after the edict set up in the market place for the utter extirpation of the Christian Religion, the whole world on the sudden turned Christian. When God knocketh by effectuall grace, the iron gates of the hardest heart flie open on the sudden. The second lesson is read by St. Gregorie, That grace is free, and not pro∣cured by any merit of ours. Here was no matter of this winde, nor natu∣rall cause of this sound; no more can there be assigned any meritorious cause
in us of supernaturall grace. Who can cause the sunne to rise, or the wind to blow, or the deaw to fall? much lesse can any procure by his merits ei∣ther the beames of the sunne of righteousnesse to shine, or the gales of the spi∣rit to blow, or the deaw of grace to fall upon him. Therefore the Synod at Diospolis condemnes them for Heretickes, who affirmed Gratiam Dei se∣cundum merita hominum dari; that the grace of God is given according to mans merits. And the Synod at Arausica pronounced an Anathema a∣gainst such as teach, that man beginneth, and God perfects: Whosoever (say they) teach, that to him that asketh, seeketh, & knocketh, &c.Concil. Arau∣sic. c. 6. Si quis sine gratiâ Dei credentibus, volentibus, pulsantibus, &c. grace is given, and not that by the infusion and inspiration of the holy Spirit this is wrought in us, that we beleeve, aske, or knocke, gain-sayeth the Apostle demanding, what hast thou that thou hast not received? The third lesson is Origens, That good motions are as suddenly gone as they come. The Spouse in the Canticles on the sudden findeth her husband, & on the sudden loseth him; which I call God to witnesse (saithOrig. in Cant. Conspicit Sponsa Spon∣sum, qui con∣spectus statim abscessit, & frequenter hoc in toto carmi∣ne facit, quod nisi quis patia∣tur non potest intelligere: sae∣pe, Deus est te∣stis, Sponsum mihi adventa∣te conspexi, & mecum esse, & subitò rece∣dentem inve∣nire non po∣tui. Origen) I my selfe have sensible experience in my meditations upon this book. And who of us in his private devotions findeth not the like? Sometimes in our di∣vine conceptions, contemplations, and prayers, we are as it were on float, sometimes on the sudden at an ebbe; sometimes wee are carried with full saile, sometimes we sticke as it were in the haven. The use we are to make hereof is, when we heare the gales of the Spirit rise, to hoise up our sailes; to listen to the sound when we first heare it, because it will be soon blown over; to cherish the sparkes of grace, because if they be not cherished, they will soone dye. There came a sound. Death entred in at the windowes, that is, the eyes (saith Origen) but life at the eares.Gal. 1.8. For the just shall live by faith, and faith com∣meth by hearing. The sound is not without the wind; for the Spirit ordina∣rily accompanieth the preaching of the Word: neither is the wind without the sound. Away then with Anabaptisticall Enthustiasts, try the spirits whether they be of God or no by the Word of God: To theEsay 8.20. Law and to the te∣stimony (saith the Prophet Esay) If they speake not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them: And if we (saith the Apostle) or an An∣gel from heaven preach unto you any other Gospel than what ye have received, that is, (saith St.Aug. contr. lit. Petil. l. 3. c. 6. Praeter∣quam quod in Scripturis lega∣libus, & Evan∣gelicis acce∣pistis, Anathe∣ma sit. Austine) than what is contained in the Propheticall and A∣postolicall writings, let him be accursed. From heaven. This circumstance affordeth us a threefold doctrine: 1. That the Spirit hath a dependance on the Son, and proceedeth from him: for the Spirit descended not till after the Son ascended, who both commanded his Disciples to stay at Jerusalem, and wait for the promise of the Father, which yee haveAct. 1.4. heard (saith he) from mee: and promised after his departure to send theJohn 15.26. When the com∣forter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Fa∣ther. Act. 1.5. Yee shall be bapti∣zed with the holy Ghost, not many dayes hence. spirit, and accordingly sent him ten dayes after his ascension with the sound of a mighty wind in the likenesse of fiery cloven tongues. 2. That the Gospel is of divine authority. As the Law came from hea∣ven, so the Gospel; and so long as we preach Gods word, ye still heare so∣num de coelo, a sound from heaven. ThusLactan. instit. l. 3. c. 30. Ecce vox de coelo veritatem do∣cens, & sole ipso clarius lu∣men osten∣dens. Lactantius concludes in the end of his third booke of divine institutions, How long shall we stay (saith he) till Socrates will know any thing, or Anaxagoras find light in darknesse, or De∣mocritus
draw up the truth from the bottome of a deep Well, or Empedocles enlarge the narrow pathes of his senses, or Arcesilas and Carneades, accor∣ding to their sceptick doctrine, see, feele, or perceive any thing? Behold a voice from heaven teaching us the truth, and discovering unto us a light brighter than the sunne. 3. That the doctrine of the Gospel is not earthly, but of a heavenly na∣ture, that it teacheth us to frame our lives to a heavenly conversation, that it mortifieth our fleshly lusts, stifleth ambitious desires, raiseth our mind from the earth, and maketh us heavenly in our thoughts, heavenly in our af∣fections, heavenly in our hopes and desires. For albeit there are excellent morall and politicke precepts in it, directing us to manage our earthly af∣faires; yet the maine scope and principall end thereof is, to bring the King∣dome of heaven unto us by grace, and us into it by glory. This a meer sound cannot doe: therefore it is added, As of a rushing mighty wind. This blast or wind is a sacred symbole of the Spirit, and there is such a manifold resemblance between them, that the same word, (in Hebrew  in Greeke , in Latine spiritus) signifieth both: what so like as wind to the Spirit? 1. As the wind bloweth where itJohn 3.8. listeth, so the Spirit inspireth whom he pleaseth. 2. As wee feele the wind, and heare it, yet see it not; so wee heare of the Spirit in the word, and feele him in our hearts, yet see him not. 3. As breath commeth from the heat of our bowells; so the third per∣son, as the Schooles determine, proceedeth from the heat of love in the Fa∣ther and the Son. 4. As the wind purgeth the floore, and cleanseth the aire, so the Spirit purifieth the heart. 5. As in a hot summers day nothing so refresheth a traveller as a coole blast of wind; so in the heat of persecutions, and heart burning sorrow of afflictions, nothing so refresheth the soule as the comfort of the Spirit, who is therefore stiled Paracletus, the Comforter. 6. As the wind in an instant blowes downe the strongest towers and highest trees; so the Spirit overthrowes the strongest holds of Sathan, and humbleth the haughtiest spirit. 7. As the wind blowing upon a garden, carrieth a sweet smell to all parts whither it goeth; so the Spirit bloweth upon, and openeth the flowers of Paradise, and diffuseth the savour of life unto life through the whole Church. 8. As the wind driveth the ship through the waves of the sea, & carrieth it to land; so the gales of Gods Spirit carrie us through the troublesome waves of this world, and bring us into the haven where wee would bee. Cui cum Patre, & Filio sit laus, &c.
THE MYSTERIE OF THE FIERY CLOVEN TONGUES. THE LXV. SERMON. ACTS 2.3. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sate upon each of them. AMong the golden rules ofCael. Rodig. lib. antiq. lect. Nunquam de Deo sine lu∣mine loquen∣dum. Pythagoras so much admired by antiquity, this was one, that we ought not to speake of God without light: the meaning of which precept was not, that we ought not to pray to God, or speake of him in the night, or the darke; but that the nature of God is dark to us, and that we may not presume to speak thereof without some divine light from heaven. Nothing may be confidently or safely spoken of him, which hath not been spoken by him. In which regardSalv. de gu∣bern. lib. 1. Tanta est Ma∣jestatis sacrae, & tam tre∣menda reve∣rentia, ut non solùm illa quae contra re∣ligionem no∣stram dicun∣tur horrete, sed etiam quae pro religione ipsi dicimus cum grandi metu dicere debeamus. Salvianus professeth, that hee wrote in defence of the true religion in feare and trembling. To the end therefore that the A∣postles, who were appointed to be Pastores pastorum, Pastors of pastors, and Doctors of Divinity through the whole world, might not speake of him who dwelleth in a light which none can approach unto, without light; the holy Ghost on this day cast his beames upon them, shining in the fiery cloven tongues. The tongues appeared cloven (saith SaintBernard. serm. de Pent. Sunt dispertitae linguae propter multiplices cogitationes, sed earum multiplicitas, & uno lumine veritatis, & uno charitatis fervore fit tanquam ignis. Bernard) to represent the multiplicity of thoughts, yet the multiplicity of them shined in one light of truth, and one fervour of charity, as it were one fire. There appeared
new lightnings (saithCrysol. serm. de Pent. No∣va lucis fulgu∣ra coruscrunt, & micantium splendor lin∣guarū: igneae ut scirent quod loquerentur, linguae ut lo∣querentur quod scirent. Chrysologus) in the aire, and the lustre of shining tongues: shining to give them light that they might know what they spake, and tongues to give them eloquence, whereby they might utter what they knew. This apparition as it was very strange, so to outward appearance also most dreadfull; for it was an apparition of a spirit, and that in fire, and this fire cast it selfe into the shape of tongues, and these tongues were cloven. Of all sights, apparitions of spirits most affright us: of all apparitions of spirits, those in fire most dazle our eyes: and never fire before seene in these shapes sitting upon the heads of any. Yet was it a most comfortable apparition, because it was the manifestation of the Comforter himselfe. The Spirit was no evill spirit, but the holy Ghost: the fire was no consuming, but only an enlightening flame: the tongues proclaimed not warre, but spake peace to the Apostles: neither did the cleaving of them in sunder betoken the spi∣rit of contradiction or division amongst them, but the diversitie of langua∣ges wherewith they were furnished: neither did the fire sitting on them, singe their haire, but rather crowne their heads with gifts and graces befit∣ting the teachers of the whole world. Let the seeming and outward ter∣rour then of the signes serve to stirre up your attention, to listen to what the tongues speake unto you, and yee shall finde the fire of the spirit at your hearts, to enlighten your thoughts, and enflame your affections, and purge out the drosse of your naturall corruptions. Lo here 1. An apparition of tongues. 2. Tongues of fire. 3. Fire sitting. 1. Tongues cloven and floating in the aire, a strange sight. 2. Tongues as of fire, a strange matter. 3. Fire sitting, a strange posture. Of which before I can freely discourse, I must loosen three knots which I finde tyed upon the words of my text: 1. By Grammarians. 2. By Philosophers. 3. By Divines. The first is, how doth , or sedit in the singular number, agree with , or linguae in the plurall? The second, whether was the miracle in the tongues of the Apostles, or in the eares of the hearers? For either way it might come to passe, that men of severall languages might heare them speake in their severall tongues the wonderfull works of God. The third, how was the holy Ghost united to these tongues? hyposta∣tically or sacramentally? The first knot is thus untyed; either that there is an errour in our copies, vitio scriptoris, writing  for  for α, or that  is to bee construed with , ignis, not , and it sate, that is the fire, upon each of them. The second is thus dissolved; the miracle was in the tongues of the Apostles: forMark. 16.17. Christ promised that they should speake with new tongues, not that their hearers should heare with new eares. Yee (saithAct. 1.5. Christ) shall be baptized with the holy Ghost, and with fire, not many dayes hence: and ac∣cordingly
the Apostles saw fierie cloven togues, not cloven eares; and the fire1 Cor. 14.2.sate upon them, it licked not the eares of their auditours. More∣over, it is evident out of the Epistle to the Corinthians, that many who were endued with the gift of tongues, might and did use it in the assembly of the faithfull, when they that heard them understood them not, which could not be if the miraculous gift had beene in their eares, and not in their tea∣chers tongues. The third knot is thus loosened: the holy Ghost was united to these tongues, neither hypostatically nor sacramentally, but symbolically only. If hee had beene united to them hypostatically, the Apostles might and ought to adore the Spirit in them, and the fire might as truely have beene said the holy Ghost, as the man Christ to be God. Neither were the wind and fire Sacraments, because no seales of the covenant, no conduits of sa∣ving grace, of no permanent or perpetuall use. S.Tract. 99. in Johan. Non magis ad unitatem personae spi∣ritui sancto hic ignis fuit conjunctus, ut ex illo & Deo una persona constaret, quam colum∣ba, Matth. 3. ista enim fa∣cta sunt de creaturâ servi∣ente, non de ipsâ dominan∣te naturà. Austine thus resolveth, This fire cut out as it were into severall portions like tongues, was no otherwise united to the holy Ghost than the Dove, Matth. 3. neither of which was so assumed, as that of it and God one person consisted: the Spirit in these apparitions useth the creature, but united not himselfe unto it personally or substantially. And there appeared. In the originall , there were seene: for it was no delusion of sense, but a true and reall apparition: the Apostles with their eyes beheld them, and with their tongues testified the truth of this apparition of tongues. False religions, such as the Pagan and Popish, make use of false apparitions and lying wonders, whereby they bleare the eyes, and seduce the soules of the simple: but the true religion, as it disalloweth all sophisticall arguments and false shewes of reason, so also it disavoweth all false apparitions and deceivable signes. The witch at Endor raised up a man, or rather a spirit, in the likenesse of Samuel, who never was seene after that day he communed with Saul: but those whom our Saviour rai∣sed lived many dayes if not yeeres after. Conjurers and Inchanters set be∣fore their guests daintie dishes in shew and appearance, but their greater hunger after them is an evident demonstration, that the Divell all the while fed their fancies with Idaeas and resemblances, and not their stomacks with solid meats: but our Lord when heeJoh. 6.10, 11, 12, 13. multiplyed the loaves and fishes, hee gave this sensible and undeniable proofe of the truth of this miracle, both by saturitie in the stomacks of the people, and by substantiall remnants thereof in the baskets. When they were filled (saith the Evangelist) hee said to his disciples, Gather the fragments that remaine, that nothing be lost. There∣fore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten. Cloven tongues. The holy Ghost which now first appeared in the like∣nesse of tongues, moved the tongues of all the Prophets that have spoken since the world began. For the2 Pet. 1.21. prophecie came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost. Of all the parts of the body God especially requireth two, the heart & the tongue; the heart wherebyRom. 10.10. man beleeveth unto righteousnesse, and the tongue where∣by he maketh confession unto salvation: the heart to love God, the tongue
to praise him. Out of which consideration the Heathen, as Plutarch obser∣veth, dedicated the Peach-tree to the Deitie, because the fruit thereof re∣sembleth the heart of man, and the leafe his tongue. And to teach us that the principall use of our tongue is to sound out the praises of our maker, the Hebrew calleth the tongue, Cobod, that is, glory, as, My heart was glad,Psal. 16.9. & 30.13 & 57.9. Buxtorph. E∣pit. radic. and , my tongue also (Hebrew my glory also) rejoyceth. They who glori∣fie not God with their tongue, may be truly said to have no tongue in the Hebrew language: and verily they deserve no tongues, who make them not silver trumpets to sound out the glory of God. And if such forfeit their tongues, how much more doe they who whet them against God and his truth; whose mouths are full of cursing and bitternesse, direfull imprecations and blasphemous oathes? These have fierie tongues, but not kindled from heaven; but rather, as S.Chap. 3.6. James speaketh, set on fire of hell: and their tongues also are cloven by schisme, faction, and contention, not as these in my text for a mysticall signification. Cloven. Some by cloven understand linguas bifidas, two-forked tongues, and they will have them to be an embleme of discretion and serpentine wis∣dome: others linguas dissectas, slit tongues, like the tongues of such birds as are taught to speake; and these conceive them to have beene an embleme of eloquence. For such kinde of tonguesHieroglyph. l. 33. Pierius affirmeth, that the Hea∣then offered in sacrifice to Mercurie their god of eloquence; and they made them after a sort fierie, by casting them into the fire, ad expurgandas perperam dictorum labes, to purge out the drosse of vain discourses: . In the originall it is , tongues parted at the top, but joyned at the roote: and they represented (saithIn Act. Quia in proximo debebant di∣vidi in omnes terras. Gorrhan) the dispersion of the Apostles, which after ensued, into all countries. These tongues were not of fire, but As it were of fire. The matter of which these tongues consisted was not grosse and earthly, but aeriall, or rather heavenly, like the fire whichExod. 3.2. Moses saw in the bush: for as that, so this had the light, but not the burning heat of fire. It is not said of fires in the plurall, but of fire in the singular number, because as the silver trumpets were made all of one piece, so these twelve tongues were made of one fierie matter, to illustrate the diversitie of gifts proceeding from the same spirit. And it sate. Sitting in the proper sense is a bodily gesture, and agreeth not to tongues or fire; yet because it is a gesture of permanencie or con∣tinuance, the word is generally used in the originall for ,Chrys. in Act. 2. . signifying to abide or reside: and so it may expresse unto us the continuance of these gifts of the Spirit in the Apostles, and may put us in minde of our dutie, which is to sit to our preaching, and continue in the labours of the mini∣strie. Give1 Tim. 4.13, 14, 15. attendance (saith the Apostle) to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecie, with the laying on of the hands of the presbyterie. Meditate upon these things, give thy selfe wholly to them, that thy profiting may appeare to all. Upon each of them. Whether these tongues entred into the mouths of the Apostles, as Amphilochius writeth of S. Basil, or rested upon their heads, as S. Cyril imagined; whence some derive the custome ofLorinus in Act. c. 2. impo∣sition of hands upon the heads of those who are consecrated Bishops, or
ordained Priests, it is not evident out of the text; but this is certaine and evident that it sate upon each of them. It sate not upon Peter onely, but upon the rest as well as him: S. Chrysostome saith, upon theChrys. in act. c. 2. . hundred and twentie that were assembled in that upper roome: those who say least, af∣firme that it rested upon all the Apostles. For howsoever the Papists take all occasions to advance S. Peter above the rest of the Apostles, that the Roman See might be advanced through him, (as Hortensius the Oratour extolled eloquence to the skies, that hee might bee lifted up thither with her:) yet the Scripture giveth him no preheminence here or elsewhere: for Christ delivereth the keyes of heaven (with the power of binding and loo∣sing) into allMatt. 18.18. Whatsoever ye binde on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever yee loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. of their hands: he breathes vpon them all, John 20.21, 22. and sendeth them with as full commission as his Father sent him. All their names shine in theApoc. 21.14. foundation and gates of the heavenly Jerusalem: and here in my text fierie cloven tongues sate upon each of them. And there appeared unto them, &c. As in the Sacrament of Christs bo∣dy, so in these symbols of the spirit we are to consider two things. 1. The signes, or outward elements. 2. The thing signified by them. Of the signes yee have heard heretofore: hold out, I beseech you, your religious attention to the remainder of the time, and yee shall heare in briefe of the thing signified by them. Miracles for the most part in holy Scripture are significant: the cloudie pillar signified the obscure know∣ledge of Christ under the Law, the pillar of fire the brighter knowledge of him in the Gospell; the renting of the veile at the death of our Saviour the opening of the way to the Sanctum Sanctorum, into which our high Priest Christ Jesus entred after his death, and there appeareth for us; the curing of all bodily diseases by the word of Christ, the healing of all spiri∣tuall maladies by his word preached. Now if other miracles were signifi∣cant and enunciative, how much more this of tongues? Verily he hath little sight of celestiall mysteries, who cannot discerne divine eloquence in these tongues, diversitie of languages in the cleaving of them, and knowledge and zeale in the fire. As S. John Baptist was, so all the dispensers of Gods my∣steries ought toBernard. in verb. Christi. Ille erat lu∣cerna ardens, & lucens; lu∣cere vanum est, ardere parum, lucere, & ar∣dere perfe∣ctum. bee, burning and shining lamps; shining in knowledge, burning in zeale. There are three reasons assigned by learned Commentators, why the Spirit manifested himselfe in the likenesse of fierie tongues. 1. To shew his affinitie with the Word, such as is between fire and light: the Word is the true light, that enlighteneth everie one that commeth into the world; and here the Spirit descended in the likenesse of fire. 2. To shew that as by the tongue wee taste all corporall meats, drinks, and medicinall potions: so by the Spirit wee have a taste of all spirituall things. 3. To teach us that as by the tongue wee speake, so by the Spirit wee are enabled to utter magnalia Dei, the wonderfull works of God, and the mysteries of his kingdome: It is not yee thatMatt. 10.20. speake (saith our Saviour) but the Spirit which speaketh in you, which Spirit spake by the month of the Pro∣phets that have beene since the world began. Our mouthes and tongues are but like organ-pipes, the breath which maketh them sound out Gods
praises is the Spirit. And those that have their spirituall senses exercised, can distinguish betweene the sound of the golden bels of Aaron, and of the tinckling1 Cor. 13.1. Cymball S. Paul speaketh of: for sacred eloquence consisteth not in the enticing words of mans wisdome, but in demonstration of the Spirit and power. The fire by which these tongues were enlightened was not earthly, but heavenly, and therefore it is said, As of fire. Christ three severall times powred out his spirit upon his Apostles; first,Vers. 1.16. Matthew the tenth, at their election and first mission: the second isVers. 22. John the twentieth, when he breathed on them, and said, Receive yee the holy Ghost: and thirdly, in this place. At the first they received the spirit of wisdome and knowledge: at the second, the spirit of power and authority: at the third, the spirit of zeale and courage. As many proprieties as the naturall Philosophers observe in fire, so ma∣ny vertues the Divines will have us note in the Spirit given to the faithfull: they are specially eight; Illuminandi, of enlightening: 2. Inflammandi, of heating: 3. Purgandi, of purifying: 4. Absumendi, of consuming: 5. Li∣quefaciendi, of melting: 6. Penetrandi, of piercing: 7. Elevandi, of lif∣ting up, or causing to ascend: 8. Convertendi, of turning. For darknesse is dispelled, cold expelled, hardnesse mollified, metall purified, combusti∣ble matter consumed, the pores of solid bodies penetrated, smoake raised up, and all fuell turned into flame or coale by fire. 1. Of enlightening, this Leo applyeth to the Spirit: 2. Of enflaming, this Gregory worketh upon: 3. Of purifying, this Nazianzen noteth: 4. Of consuming, this Chrysostome reckons upon: 5. Of melting, this Calvin buildeth upon: 6. Of penetrating, this S. Paul1 Cor. 2.10. The Spirit searcheth all things. pointeth to: 7. Of elevating, this Dionysius toucheth upon: 8. Of converting, and this Origen and many of our later writers run upon. 1. Fire enlighteneth the aire, the Spirit the heart: 2. Fire heateth the body, the Spirit the soule: 3. Fire purgeth out drosse, the Spirit our sinnes: 4. Fire consumeth the stubble, the Spirit our lusts: 5. Fire melteth metals, the Spirit the hardest heart: 6. Fire pierceth into the bones, the Spirit into the inmost thoughts: 7. Fire elevateth water and fumes, the Spirit carrieth up our medi∣tations with our penitent teares also to heaven. 8. Fire turneth all things into its owne nature, the Spirit converteth all sorts of men, and of carnall maketh them spirituall. These operations of the Spirit, God grant wee may feele in our soules, so shall we be worthy partakers of Christ his body, and by him be sancti∣fied in body and soule here, and glorified in both hereafter. To whom, &c.
CHRIST HIS LASTING MONUMENT, A Sermon preached on Maundy Thursday, THE LXVI. SERMON. 1 CORINTH. 11.26. As often as yee eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup, yee doe shew the Lords death till he come. WHen our Saviour was lifted up from the earth to draw all to him, and his armes were stretched out at full length to compasse in and embrace all true beleevers: after he had bowed his head, as it were to take leave of the world, and so given up the ghost, a souldier with aJohn 19.34. speare pierced his side, and forthwith came there out water and bloud. Which was done to fulfill two prophecies, the one ofExod. 12.46. Moses, A bone of him shall not be broken; the other ofZech. 12.10. Zechary, They shall looke on him whom they pierced: as also to institute twoChrysost. Cy∣rillus, Theophi∣lact. in hunc locum, Dama∣scenus lib. 4. de fid. c. 10. Aug. l. 2. de Symb. c. 6. & tract. 9. in Johan. Sacraments, the one in the water, the other in the bloud that ran from him; the one to wash away the filth of originall sinne, the other to purge the guilt of all actuall: The hole in Christs side is the source and spring of both these Wells of salvation in the Church, which are continually filled with that which then issued out of our Lords side. For albeit he dyed but once actu, yet he dyeth continually virtute: and although his bloud was shed but once really on the crosse, yet it is shed figuratively and mystically both at the font, and at the Lords board, when the dispenser of the sacred mysteries powreth water on the childe, or wine into the chalice, and by consecrating the bread apart from the wine, severeth the bloud of Christ from his body. In relation to
which lively representation of his sufferings the Apostle affirmeth, that as oft as we eate of that bread, and drinke of that cup, wee shew the Lords death till he come. In the Tabernacle there was sanctum, & sanctum sanctorum, a holy place, & a place most holy; so in the Church Calendar there is a holy time, all the time of Lent, and the most holy this weeke, wherein our blessed Saviour made sixe steps to the Crosse, and having in sixe dayes accomplished the workes of mans redemption, as his Father in the like number of dayes had finished the workes of creation, the seventh day kept hisBernard. in dic Pasch. Fe∣ria sexta rede∣mit hominem, ipso die, quo fecerat, sequen∣ti die sabbati∣zavit in mo∣numento. Sabbaths rest in the grave. Now above all the dayes of this holiest weeke, this hath one pri∣viledge, that in it Christ made his last will and testament, and instituted the sacrament of the Eucharist, and administred it in his owne person, delive∣ring both the consecrated bread and cup of blessing to his Apostles with his owne hand. Which mysterious actions of his were presidents in all suc∣ceeding ages, and rules for the administration of that sacrament to the worlds end. For, Primum in unoquoque genere mensura est reliquorum, the first action in any sacred or civill institution in respect of those that succeed, is like the originall to all after-draughts, and the copy to all that write by it. Such was the first institution of marriage in Paradise, of circumcision in A∣brahams family, of the passover in Egypt, of all the other types and figures of the Law on Mount Sinai, and of the Lords Supper in this upper roome; wherein all Christs speeches and actions may not unfitly bee termed Ru∣bricks, to direct the Christian Church in these mysterious rites. For be∣fore the end of the next day they were all coloured in bloud. What was done now in effigie, was then done in personâ: he that now tooke bread, was ta∣ken himselfe: he that brake it, was broken on the crosse: he that gave it to his Disciples, was given up for our sinnes: he who tooke the cup, received from his Father a cup of trembling: he who powred out the wine, shed his owne bloud; in memory of which reall effusion thereof unto death, we ce∣lebrate this sacramentall effusion unto life. For so he commanded us, saying,Luke 22.19. Doe this in remembrance of mee: and his faithfull Apostle fully declareth his meaning in the words of my Text, As often, &c. As Christ1 John 5 6. came to us not by water only, but by water and bloud; so wee must come to him not by water only, the water of regeneration in baptisme, but also by the bloud of redemption, which is drunke by us in this sacrament, in obedience to his commandement, and in acknowledgement of his love to us even to death, and in death it selfe. As aHieron. in hunc locum. Quemdmo∣dum si quis peregre profi∣cisns aliquid pignoris ei quem diligit derelinquit, ut quotiscunque illud vid t, possit ejus be∣neficia & ami∣citias memo∣rare, quod ille si perfctè di∣lexit, non po∣test sine ingen∣te desidrio vi∣dere vel etu. man taking a long journie, leaveth a pledge with his friend, that whensoever he looketh upon it, he should thinke upon him in his absence; so Christ being to depart out of this world, left these sacred elements of bread and wine with his Church, to the end that as often as she seeth them, she should thinke of him and his sufferings for her. When Ae∣neas plucked a twigge of the tree under which Polydorus was buried, the bough dropped bloud: Vrg Aen 3.—cruor de stipite manat. so as soone as we plucke but a twigge of the tree of Christs crosse, it will bleed a fresh in our thoughts, shewing us to be guilty of the death of the Lord of life. For though we never consulted with the chiefe Priests, nor drave the bargaine with Judas, nor pronounced sentence against him with Pi∣late,
nor touched his hand or foot with a naile: yet sith hee was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities, and theEsa. 53.5, 6. chastisement of our peace was upon him, and the Lord laid on him the sinnes of us all, we cannot plead not guilty, inasmuch as our sinnes were the causes of all his sufferings. The Passover by the Law was to be eaten with sowre herbes: and in like manner the Christian passover, which wee are now met to eate, must bee eaten with sowre herbes, that is, pensive thoughts, and a sad re∣membrance both of our sinfull actions, and our Saviours bloudy passion. For as oft as yee eate, &c. The coherence, or rather consequence of this verse to the former, is like to that of the Eccho to the voice: the words of institution rehearsed in the former verses are as the voice, the inference of the Apostle in this verse as the Eccho. For as the Eccho soundeth out the last words of the voice, so the Apostle here repeateth the last words of Christs institution, Doe this in remembrance of mee: and in effect explaineth them, saying, to do it in remembrance of Christ, that is, as oft as ye do it, ye shew forth his death. 1. We are but once born, and therefore but once receive the sacrament of Baptism, which is the seale of our regeneration; but we feed often, & con∣sequently are often to receive the sacrament, which is the seale of our spirituall nourishment & growth in Christ: and therfore the Apostle saith, As often as. 2. Whensoever wee communicate wee must make an entire meale and refection thereof: therefore he addeth, Ye eate and drinke. 3. In making this spirituall refection, wee must thinke upon Christ his bloudy passion, and declare it to others: therefore he addeth, Yee shew the Lords death. 4. This commemoration of his death must continue till hee hath fully revenged his death, and abolished death it selfe in all his mysticall mem∣bers: therefore he addeth, Till he come. As oft as ye are bid to the Lords Table, and come prepared, eate of this bread; and as oft as ye eate of this bread, drinke of this cup: and when yee eate and drinke, shew forth the Lords death; and let this annuntiation conti∣nue till he come. If ye take away this band of connexion, the parts falling asunder will be these: 1. The time when. 2. The manner how. 3. The end why. 4. The terme how long wee are to celebrate this supper. 1. The time frequent, As often. 2. The manner entire, Eate and drinke. 3. The end demonstrative, Shew forth. 4. The terme perpetuall, Till he come, that is, to the end of the world. As often. Wee never reade of any (saithPraef. institut. Nusquam legi∣mus reprehen∣sos qui nimium de fonte aquae vitae hauserint. Calvin) that were blamed for drawing too much water out of the Wells of salvation: neither doe we find ever any taxed for too often, but for too seldome communicating; which is utterly a fault among many at this day, who are bid (shall I say) thrice, nay twelve times, every moneth once, before they come to the Lords Table; and
then they come (it is to be feared) more out of feare of the Law, than love of the Gospel. Surely as when the appetite of the stomach to wholsome meat faileth, as in the disease called , the body pines, and there is a sensible decay in all parts; so it falleth out in the spirituall , when the soule hath no appetite to this bread of life, and food of Angels, the inward man pineth away, and all the graces of the spirit sensibly decay in us. This malady the Apostle suspected not to be in his Corinthians: and therefore he imposeth not here a law of often receiving, but supposeth they did so: for he imagined not that any would be so carelesse of their life & safety, as not often to exemplifie the copy of their pardon. He conceived that he needed not to bid any to drink freely of the wine that maketh glad the heart of every communicant, or to eate frequently of the food that perisheth not: therefore taking that for granted, he prescribeth the manner how, and the end why they were often to celebrate this sacrament, saying, As oft As ye eate. There are three kinds of eating: 1. Spiritually only. 2. Sacramentally only. 3. Sacramentally and spiritually. 1. They eate Christ spiritually only who beleeve the incarnation & passi∣on of our Lord and Saviour, yet dye before they are called to his Table. 2. They eate sacramentally only, who are bid to the marriage feast, and come thither also and eate of the Brides cake, & drink of her wine, but have not on the wedding garment: such were the Jewes, who ate manna in theJohn 6.49. wildernesse, and dyed in their sins: and Judas at Christs last supper, and all infidels and hypocrites, who receive at the Sacrament panem Domini, not panem Dominum, the Lords bread, but not the Lord himselfe, who is that bread ofJohn 6.48. life. 3. They eate Christ both sacramentally and spiritually, who beleeving in Christs incarnation and passion, according to his command, come with pre∣paration unto this Table, and with their mouth feed upon the outward ele∣ment: which may be considered three wayes, 1. In substance, so it is bread, or wine. 2. In use, so it is a sacrament. 3. In significancy and efficacy to all beleevers, so it is the bo∣dy and bloud of Christ. And drinke. It is worth your observation, that our adversaries the Pa∣pists, who are so much against a figure in the words used in the consecra∣tion of the bread, This is my body, yet are forced to admit of a double figure in the words used in the consecration of the cup, This is the new Testament in my bloud. If they cast not here a double figure, they are lost: for first, there is continens pro contento, the cup put for the liquor contained in it. Se∣condly, in those words, as likewise in the words of my Text, they must di∣gest a Metonymie, or swallow downe flagons and cups. This cup. The sacrament is called a cup in a double respect: 1. Quia potus, drinke to nourish and refresh the soule. 2. Quia potio, because a medicinall potion to purge the conscience.
In ep. ad Cor. 1. c. 11. Materi∣alis, qui debet sumi parcè, da∣ri largè: sacra∣mentalis, qui debet sumi in∣nocenter, tra∣ctari reveren∣tèr: spiritualis, scilicet passio∣nis vel poeni∣tentiae, qui de∣bet sumi liben∣ter, sustineri lae∣tanter: vitupe∣rabilis, qui de∣bet estundi sim∣plicitèr.Gorrhan findeth out foure sorts of cups, and engraveth upon each of them a severall poesie. 1. The materiall or ordinary cup, which (saith hee) ought to be taken sparingly, but given liberally. 2. The sacramentall, which ought to be taken innocently, and touched reverently. 3. The spirituall, which ought to bee taken willingly, and borne joy∣fully. 4. The abominable and execrable cup, which ought to be refused abso∣lutely, or shed wholly. But although this fourth cup bee mentioned (Apoc. 17.4.) yet wee will content our selves at this time with these three cups: 1. Calix consolationis, the cup of mirth and spirituall conso∣lation. 2. Calix afflictionis, the cup of affliction. 3. Calix benedictionis, the cup of blessing. Of the firstPsal. 23.5. David dranke freely. Of the secondJer. 16.7. Lam. 4.21. Ezek. 23.33. Jeremy sorrowfully. Of the third the1 Cor. 10.6. Corinthians holily. If this cup in my text be calix benedictionis, the cup of blessing, then cer∣tainely the Romish Priests deserve calicem maledictionis, a cup of cursing, who deprive the laity of this cup. They cannot say in their congregation to the people, As oft as yee drinke of this cup; for they never drinke of it. To whom belongeth the commandement of eating, Take, eate? to the Priests onely? Why then doe the Laity among them eat? To the Laity also? Why then doe they not drink, sith it is most evident in the text that Christ said,Mat 26.27. Drinke ye all of this, to whom before he gave the bread, saying, Take, eate?Mat. 19.6. Those things which God hath joyned together let no man put asunder. If the cup were not needfull, why did Christ adde it to his Supper? If it were needfull, why doe they take it away? Doubtlesse as halfe a meale is no meale, nor halfe a hand a hand, nor halfe a ship a ship; so neither is their halfe communion a Sacrament: si dividis perdis. This is the cup of the New Testament, saith Christ, which is shed forMat. 26.28. many for the remission of sinnes. Are these many onely Priests? Had the Laity no sinnes, or no remission of sinnes by Christs bloud? If they have, as they all professe, why doe they forbid them that which Christ expressely commandeth them? Drink ye all of this, for it is shed for you, and for many. But to go no farther than this chap∣ter: when St. Paul requireth, ver. 28. Let a man examine himselfe, I would willingly examine our Adversaries, whether this precept concerneth the lay people or no? They will say it doth especially, because they most need exa∣mination, that they may confesse their sinnes, and receive absolution for them, before they presume to come to the Lords Table: let them then reade what followeth in the same verse, and so let them eate of that bread and drink of that cup. Ye doe shew the Lords death. The Apostle doth not hereby exclude o∣ther ends of receiving the Sacrament, but sheweth this to be the chiefest. God never set so many remarkeable accidents upon any thing as on his Sonnes death, at which the Sun was eclipsed, the rockes were cloven, the
vaile of the Temple rent from the top to the bottome, the graves opened, and the dead arose. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints, but most precious the death of his holy One: for this Sacrament was prin∣cipally instituted to keepe in remembrance that his precious death. Wee shew forth Christs death three manner of wayes; 1 In verbo. 2 In signo. 3 In opere. 1 By commemoration of the historie of his passion. 2 By representation thereof in the sacred Symboles. 3 By expression thereof in our death to sinne. And as it is more to shew forth Christs death in signo, by administring or participating the Sacrament thereof, than in verbo, by discoursing of his passion: so it is much more to shew it forth in opere, in mortifying our mem∣bers upon earth, and crucifying the lusts of the flesh, than in verbo or signo. After these three wayes we must all shew forth the Lords death Till he come. To wit, either to each particular man at the houre of his death, or to all men and the whole Church on earth at the day of judgement. This Sacrament is called by the auncient Fathers viaticum morientium, the dying mans provision for the long journey he is to take. Every faithfull Chri∣stian therefore is to communicate as long as he is able, and can worthily pre∣pare himselfe, even to the day of his dissolution; and all congregations pro∣fessing the Christian religion, must continue the celebration of this holy Sa∣crament till the day of the worlds consummation. As often. The seldomer we come to the table of some men the welcomer we are: but on the contrary, wee are the better welcome the oftener wee come to the Lords Table with due preparation. There are two reasons espe∣cially why wee ought oft to eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup; the first is drawne from God and his glory: the second from our selves and our benefit. The oftener we partake of these holy mysteries, being qualified thereunto, the more we illustrate Gods glory, and confirme our faith. If any demand further how oft ye ought to communicate, I answer 1. In generall, as oft as yee need it, and are fit for it. TheCypr. ep. 54. Quomodo provocamus eos in confes∣sione nominis Christi sangui∣nem suum fun∣dere, si iis mi∣litaturis Chri∣sti sanguinem denegamus? aut quomodo ad Martyrii poculum ido∣neos facimus, si non eos pri∣us ad biben∣dum in Eccle∣siâ poculum jure communi∣cationis admittimus? Martyrs in the Primitive Church received every day, because looking every houre to be called to signe the truth of their religion with their bloud, they held it needfull by communicating to arme themselves against the feare of death. Others in the time of peace received either daily, or at least every Lords day. The former Saint Austine neither liketh nor disliketh, the latter he ex∣horteth all unto. 2. I answer in particular out of Fabianus, the Synod of Agatha, and the Rubrick of our Communion booke, that every one at least ought to com∣municate thrice a yeere, at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsontide: howbeit we are not so much to regard the season of the yeere, as the disposition of our mind in going forward, or drawing backe from this holy Table. The sacrament is fit for us at all times, but wee are not fit for it:Gratian. de consecrat. distinct. 2. Quotidié Eucharistiam dominicam accipere, nec laudo, nec vitupero; omnibus tamen dominicis communicandum hortor Ibid. Qui in natali Domini Paschate & Pentecoste non communicaverint, catholici non credantur, nec inter catholicos habeantur. wherefore let
every man examine his owne conscience, how hee standeth in favour with God, and peace with men: how it is with him in his spirituall estate, whe∣ther he groweth or decayeth in grace: whether the Flesh get the hand of the Spirit, or the Spirt of the Flesh; whether our ghostly strength against all temptations be increased or diminished; and accordingly (as the Spirit of God shall incline our hearts) let us either out of sense of our owne un∣worthinesse, and reverence to this most holy ordinance forbeare, or with due preparation and renewed faith and repentance approach to this Table, either to receive a supply of those graces we want, or an increase of those we have; and when we come, let us Eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup. For as both eyes are requisite to the perfection of sight, so both Elements to the perfection of the Sacrament. This the Schooles roundly confesse: Two things (saithPart. 3. q. 63. art. 1. Ideò ad Sacramenti hujus integri∣tatem duo concurrunt, scilicet, spiritu∣alis cibus & potus. Et q. 80. art. 12. Ex par∣te ipsius Sacra∣menti conve∣nit, quod u∣trumque suma∣tur, corpus scilicet & san∣guis, quia in utroque consi∣stit perfectio Sacramenti. Aquinas) concurre to the integrity of the Sacrament, viz. spirituall meate and drinke: and againe, It is requisite in regard of the Sacrament that we receive both kindes, the body and the bloud, because in both consisteth the perfection of the Sacrament. AndBonavent. in 4. sent. dist. 11. part. 2. art. 1. Perfecta re∣fectio non est in parte tan∣tùm, sed in u∣troque: ideò non in uno tantùm per∣fectè signatur Christus ut reficiens, sed in utroque. Bonaventure, A perfect refection or re∣past is not in bread only, but in bread and drinke: therefore Christ is not per∣fectly signified as feeding our soules in one kind, but in both. AndSoto in 12. distinct. q. 1. art. 12. Sacra∣mentum non nisi in utrâque specie, quan∣tum ad inte∣gram signifi∣cation em per∣ficitur. Soto, The Sacrament, as concerning the entire signification thereof, is not perfect but in both kindes. Doubtlesse, if the Sacrament be a banquet or a supper, there must be drinke in it as well as meate. The Popish communion, be it what it may be, to the Laity cannot be a supper in which the Laity sup nothing; neither can they fulfill the precept of the Apostle of shewing forth the Lords death: for the effusion of the wine representeth the shedding of Christs bloud out of the veines, and the parting of his soule from his body. If we should grant unto our adversaries, which they can never evict, that the bloud of Christ might be received in the bread, yet by such receiving Christs death by the effusion of his bloud for us, could in no wise bee represented or shewen forth; which the Apostle here teacheth to be the principall end of receiving this Sacrament: As oft, saith he, as yee eate of this bread and drinke of this cup Yee shew forth Christs death. In Christs death all Christianity is briefly summed: for in it we may observe the justice of God satisfied, the love of Christ manifested, the power of Sathan vanquished, the liberty of man from the slavery of sinne and death purchased, all figures of the Old Testa∣ment verified, all promises of the New ratified, all prophecies fulfilled, all debts discharged, all things requisite for the redemption of mankind, and to the worlds restoration accomplished. Therein we have a patterne of obe∣dience to the last breath, of humility descending as low as hell, of meeknesse putting up insufferable wrongs, of patience enduring mercilesse torments; compassion weeping and praying for bloudy persecuters; constancy hold∣ing out to the end: to which vertues of his person, if ye lay the benefits of his passion redounding to his Church, which hee hath comforted by his agony, quit by his taking, justified by his condemnation, healed by his stripes, cleansed by his bloud, quickened by his death, and crowned by his crosse; if you take a full sight of all the vertues wherewith his crosse is be∣set as with so many jewells, I make no doubt but that you will resolve with
the Apostle, to desire to know nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified. Let Israel hope in the Lord (saith thePsal. 130 7. Psalmist) for with the Lord there is mecrcy, and with him is plenteous redemption. Plenteous, for what store of bloud shed he in his agony, in his crowning with thornes, in his whipping, in his nailing, and lastly in the piercing of his side! whereas one drop of his bloud, in regard of the infinite dignity of his person, might have served for the ransome of many worlds: one drop of his bloud was more worth than all the precious things in the world. As Pliny writeth of the herbePlin. l. 22. c. 15. Scorpius herba vlet adversus ani∣mal sui nomi∣nis. Scorpius, that it is a remedy against the poyson of a Scorpion; so Christs death and crosse is a soveraigne remedy against all manner of deaths and crosses. For all such crosses make a true beleever conformable to his Redeemers image, and every conformity to him is a perfection, and every such perfe∣ction shall adde a jewell to his crown of glory. This death of Christ so pre∣cious, so soveraigne, we shew forth in shadow as it were and adumbration, when either we discourse of the history of Christs passion, or administer the Sacrament of his death; but to the life, when as Saint Francis is said to have had the print of Christs five wounds on his body, so wee have the print of them in our soules: when we expresse his death in our mortifica∣tion, when we tye our selves to our good behaviour, and restraine our de∣sires and affections, as he was nailed to the crosse: when we thirst after righ∣teousnesse, as he thirsted on the crosse for our salvation: when we are pier∣ced with godly sorrow, as his soule was heavie unto death; and when as his flesh, so our carnall lusts are crucified: when as hee commended his soule to his Father, so we in our greatest extremities commit our soules to God, as our faithfull Creatour. Cui, &c.
THE SIGNE AT THE HEART. A Sermon preached on the first Sunday in Lent. THE LXVII. SERMON. ACTS 2.37. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles; Men and brethren, What shall we do? SInnes for repentance to worke upon, and repentance for sinne, take up in a manner our whole life. Not onely the wicked (in their endlesse mazes) in the rode to hell, but even the godly, who endeavour to make the streightest steps they can to heaven, Ambulant in circuitu, walke in a kind of circuit. From fasting to feasting, and from feast∣ing againe to fasting; from Mount Gerizin to Mount Hebal, and from Mount Hebal to Mount Gerizin; from sinnes to repen∣tance, and from repentance backe againe, though against their will, to sin. It is true, that grace in the regenerate never quits the field, but groweth more and more upon corrupt nature, and in the end conquereth her: yet so conquereth her (as Lucullus and other Romane Captaines didCic. de leg. Manil. Ita ta∣men supera∣runt, ut ille pulsus supera∣tusque regna∣ret. Mithrida∣tes) that nature still ruleth in the members, and often putteth the mind to the worst, alwaies to much trouble. Wherfore as the Sea-mew that maketh her nest on the sea shore, is forced daily to repaire it, because every day the violent assault of the sea waves moulter away some part thereof; so the re∣generate and sanctified soule hath need to renew the inward man daily, and repaire the conscience by repentance, because every day, nay almost every houre, by the violent assaults of tentation and sinnes, as they are termed, of ordinary incursion, some breach or other is made into it. Now albeit private repentance hath no day set, nor time prefixed to it,
but is alwayes in season: yet now is the peculiar season of publike, when the practice of the primitive, and the sanction of the present Church calls us to watching and fasting, to weeping and mourning, to sackcloth and ashes, to humiliation and contrition; when in a manner the whole Christian world (I except only some few Heteroclites) accordeth with us in our groanes, and consorteth with our sighes, and keepeth stroake with us in the beating our breasts, and setteth open the sluces to make a floud of teares, and carry away the filth of the whole yeere past. Abyssus abyssum invocet, let this floud carry away the former deluge. Verily such is the overflowing of iniquity, and inundation of impurity in this last and worst age of the world, that the most righteous among us can hardly keep up their head, and hold out their hands above water, to call to God for mercy for themselves & o∣thers: hath not then the Church of God great reason to oppose the Eves, Embers, & Lent fasts, as so many floud-gates, if not quite to stay, yet some∣what to stop the current of sin? Anselme, sometimes Archbishop of Canter∣bury, whom the Church of Rome hath inserted into the Canon of Saints, (but he ranketh himselfe among the Apocrypha of sinners) recounting with hearts griefe and sorrow the whole course of his life, and finding the in∣fancy of sinne in the sinnes of his infancy, the youth and growth of sinne in the sinnes of his youth, and the maturity and ripenesse of all sinne in the sinnes of his ripe and perfect age, breaketh forth into this passionate speech, Quid restat tibi, O peccator, nisi ut totâ vitâ deploret totam vitam? What re∣maines for thee, wretched man, but that thou spend the remainder of thy whole life in bewailing thy whole life? What should wee (Beloved) in a manner doe else, considering that even when we pray against sin, wee sin in praying: when we have made holy vowes against sin, our vowes by the breach of them turne into sinne: after wee have repented of our sinnes, we repent of our repentance, and thereby increase our sinne? In which consi∣deration, if all the time that is given us should be aHier. ep. 7. In quadragesima abstinentiae vela pandenda sunt & tota au∣rigae retinacula laxanda. Lent of discipline, if all weekes Embers, if all daies of the weeke Ashwednesdayes, how much more ought we to keep Lent in Lent now, at least continually to call upon the name of God for our continuall blaspheming it? Now to fast for our sinnes in feasting, now to weep and mourne for our sinnes in laughing, sporting, and rioting in sinfull pleasures: to this end our tender mother the Spouse of Christ debarreth us of all other delights, that wee should make Gods sta∣tutes our delights: for this cause shee subtracteth our bodily refection, that wee may feast our soules: therefore shee taketh away or diminisheth our portion in the comforts of this life, that with holy David wee should take God for ourPsal. 119.57. portion. This is a time, as the name importeth, Lent of God to examine our accounts, and cleere them: a holy tenth of the yeere to be offe∣red to him: the sacred Eve and Vigils to the great feast of our Chrisan passover. Your humbling your bodies by watching and fasting, your soues by weeping and mourning, your rending your hearts with sighes, the resol∣ving your eyes into teares, your continuall prostration before the throne of grace, & offering up prayers with strong cryes, are at this time not only kind fruits of your devotion, speciall exercises of your mortification, neces∣sary parts of contrition, but also testimonies of obedience to the Law, and duties of conformity to Christs sufferings, and of preparation to
our most publique and solemne Communions at Easter. To pricke you on forward in this most necessarie dutie, of pricking your hearts with godly sorrow for your sinnes, I have made choyce of this verse, wherein the Evangelist S. Luke relateth the effects of S. Peters Sermon in all his auditours. 1. Inward impression, they were pricked in heart. 2. Outward expression, men and brethren, what shall we doe? What Eupolis sometimes spake of Pericles, that after his oration made to the people of Athens,Cic. de clar. orat. In animis auditorum a∣culeos reli∣quit. he left certaine needles and stings in their mindes, may be more truly affirmed of this Sermon of the Apostle, which when the Jewes heard they were pricked at heart, and not able to endure the paine, cry out men and brethren, what shall we doe? The ancient painters, to set forth the power of eloquence, drewBodin. l. 4. de rep. c. 7. Majo∣res Herculem Celticum se∣nem effinge∣bant, ex cujus ore catenarum maxima vis ad aures infinitae multitudinis perveniret, &c. Hercules Celticus with an infinite number of chaines comming out of his mouth, and reaching to the eares of great mul∣titudes: much after which manner S. Luke describeth S. Peter in my text, with his words, as it were so many golden chaines, fastened first upon the eares, and after upon the hearts of three thousand, and drawing them up at once in the drag-net of the Gospell. Now our blessed Saviour made good his promise to him, , thou shalt catch live men; and this accesse of soules to the Church, and happie successe in his ministeriall function, see∣meth to have beene fore-shewed to him by that great draught of fish ta∣ken after Christs resurrection, the draught was anJohn 21.11. hundred fiftie and three great fishes; and for all there were so many, yet, saith the text, the net was not broken. The truth alwayes exceedeth the type, for here were three thousand great and small taken, and yet the net was not broken; there was no schisme nor rupture thereby: for all the converts were of one minde, they were all affected with the same malady, they feele the same paine at the heart, and seeke for ease and help at the hands of the same Physitians, Pe∣ter and the rest of the Apostles, saying, Men and brethren, what shall we doe? Now when they heard these things they were pricked. Why, what touched them so neere? no doubt those words,Ver. 23, 24. Him being delivered by the deter∣minate counsell and fore-knowledge of God, yee have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slaine, whom God hath raised up, having loosened the paines of death, because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. This could not but touch the quickest veines in their heart, that they should be the death of the Lord of life, that they should slay their Messiah, that they should destroy the Saviour of the world. Of all sinnes murder cryeth the loudest in the eares of God and men; of all murders, the murder of an onely begotten sonne most enrageth a loving father, and extimulateth him unto revenge: in what wofull case then might they well suppose them∣selves to be, who after S. Peter had opened their eyes, saw that their hands  beene deepe in the bloud of the Sonne of God? Now their blasphe∣mous words which they spake against him, are sharp swords wounding deeply their soules; the thornes wherewith they pricked his head, and the nailes wherewith they pierced his hands and feet, pricked and pierced their very heart. They were pricked in heart: That is, they were pierced tho row with sorrow, they tooke on most grievously. Here lest wee mistake phrases of
like sound, though not of like sense, we must distinguish of spiritus compun∣ctionis, and compunctio spiritus, , and ,Rom. 11.8. a spirit of compunction reproved in the unbeleeving Jewes, and compunction of spirit, or of the heart, here noted by S. Luke: the former phrase signifieth slum∣ber, stupiditie, or obstinacie in sinne, this latter hearty sorrow for it: the former is a malady for the most part incurable, the latter is the cure of all our spirituall maladies. Now godly sorrow is termed compunction of the heart for three reasons, asLorin. in Act. c. 2. Dicitur dolor de pec∣cato admisso, quod est com∣punctio, vel quia aperitur cordis aposte∣ma, vel quia vulneratur cor amore Dei, vel quia daemon dolore & in∣vidiâ saucia∣tur. Lorinus conceiveth. 1. Because thereby the corruption of the heart is discovered, as an aposteme is opened by the pricke of a sharp instrument. 2. Because thereby, like the Spouse in the Canticles, wee become sicke of love, as the least pricke at the heart causeth a present fit of sicknesse. 3. Because thereby the Divell is, as it were, wounded with indig∣nation and envie. When they heard these things they were pricked in heart: when they were pricked in heart They said. As the stroakes in musicke answer the notes that are prickt in the rules: so the words of the mouth answerCic. 3. de Ora. Totum corpus hominis, & omnes ejus vultus, omnes∣que voces, ut nervi infidibus ita sonant, & à motu quoque animi sint pulsae. to the motions and affections of the heart. The Anatomists teach, that the heart & tongue hang upon one string. And hence it is, that as in a clocke or watch, when the first wheele is moved the hammer striketh: so when the heart is moved with any passion or perturbation, the hammer beats upon the bell, and the mouth soundeth: as we heard from David,Psal. 45.1. My heart is enditing a good matter, and my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. And from S. Paul:Rom. 10.10. With the heart man beleeveth unto righteousnesse, and with the tongue confession is made unto salvation. And from our Saviour:Luke 6.45. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things, and an evill man out of the evill treasure of his heart bringeth forth evill things; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. Many among us complaine that they are tongue-tied, that when they are at their private devotions, their words sticke in their mouths, and they cannot freely powre out their soules into the bosome of their Redeemer; but they looke not into the cause of it, they have not got a stocke of heavenly knowledge, and sanctified formes of words, their hearts are not filled with the holy spirit: for were they full, they would ea∣sily vent themselves. They cannot freely bring forth, because they have laid up nothing in the treasurie of their hearts. To Peter and the rest of the Apostles. As those that were wounded with the darts of Achilles, could no otherwise bee cured than by his salves and plaisters: so the Jewes who were wounded by S. Peters sharp reprehension, could be by no other meanes cured, than by his owne salves and receipts which he prescribeth afterwards. Here ourLorin. com∣ment. in Act. c. 2. Aliàs no∣tatum est quo∣ties Petri cum aliis Apostolis mentio fit, Pe∣trum primo loco poni tan∣quam ducem, ideoque nunc Judaei omnes ad illum se convertunt. & in c. 1. v. 13. Facit ad Petri primatum non mediocriter, quod tum Lucas in isto capite, sicut in Evangelio, texens Apostolorum catalogum, ut etiam Matthaeus & Marcus, pri∣mum ante omnes nominant. adversaries, who will not let the least tittle fall to the ground that may serve any way to advance the ti∣tle and dignity of the Bishop of Rome, will have us take speciall notice, that here and elsewhere Peter is named before the rest of the Apostles: and that yee may know that all is fish that comes to Peters net, Bellarmine will
tell you that the Popes monarchy is proclaimed in those words in the Acts, Rise up Peter, kill and eat, (Acts 11.7.) I know not with what perspective the Cardinall readeth the Scriptures; but sure I am hee seeth more in this vision, than any of the ancient or later Commentators ever discerned; yet Baronius seeth more than he: Those were healed (saith hee) who came but within the shadow of Peter. Acts 5.15. They brought forth the sicke into the streets, and laid them on beds or couches, that at the least the shadow of Pe∣ter passing by, might over-shadow them. The same vertue is given to the sha∣dow of Peter, which is given to his body, that we might know that such store of grace was given to Peter, that God would have the same gifts derived to his successours, who represent his person. Thus as yee see, the Papists as men in danger of drowning, catch at every rotten stake to support their faith in the Popes supremacy. Lorinus catcheth at the placing of a word, Bellar∣mine at a mysticall apparition, andBaron. ad an. 34. p. 303. Eadem virtus umbrae corpo∣ris Petri tra∣dita, quae & corpori, ut cognoscamus tantam gratia∣rū copiā Petro collatam, ut eadem dona in successoribus, qui referunt personam Pe∣tri, propagari Deus voluerit.Baronius at a shadow. What serveth this shadow to illustrate or confirme the Popes or Peters supremacie? It pleased God, for the manifestation of his power, and the performance of Christs promise to his disciples, that they in his name should worke greater miracles than some of those that he had done, to heale the sick by Pauls hand∣kerchiefes, and Peters shadow: Ergo, Peter was chiefe of all the Apostles, and the Pope the Monarch of the visible Church. Neither is there any clearer evidence in that vision which S. Peter saw of a sheet let downe from heaven, in which there were foure-footed beasts of the earth, and wilde beasts, and creeping things, and fowles of the aire. And hee heard a voyce saying unto him; Arise Peter, slay and eat. At manducare est capitis, saith the Cardi∣nall: but it is the head that eateth, the Pope therefore is the head. Hee should better have concluded, the Popes are the teeth: for S. Peter himselfe made no other interpretation of this vision, than that the Gentiles, whose hearts God had purified by faith, were not to bee accounted uncleane; and therefore he alledgeth this apparition in his apologie for going unto the un∣circumcised, and eating with them. As little maketh the setting of Peters name before the rest, for his authority over them. For here was a speciall reason why the Jewes directed their speech to Peter in the first place: be∣cause it was he who charged them so deepe, he put them in this perplexity; and therefore to him they addressed themselves for counsell and comfort. Elsewhere, where there is not the like occasion, others are named before him, asGal. 2.9. James, Cephas, and John, who seemed pillars. James, andMarke 16.7. Tell the disci∣ples and Peter. Andrew, and theJohn 4.2. the citie of Andrew and Peter. Disciples. Here I demand of Lori∣nus, doth the naming of Andrew before Peter, or of James, or the Disci∣ples, prove that any of these were superiours to Peter? If they were, what becomes of Peters supremacie? If they were not, what maketh the naming him before them for it? Without all question, if the setting of Peter after the rest of the Apostles & Disciples in the texts above alledged, maketh not against; the setting him here before them, maketh not for his supremacy. Men and brethren what shall we doe? Seneca saith, Levis dolor est qui con∣silium capit, It is a light griefe which admitteth of consultation: but wee may say more truly, Sanus dolor est qui consilium capit; It is an healthfull malady and an happie griefe, which drives us to our spirituall Physitian, and exciteth us to a carefull use of the meanes of salvation. S.2 Cor. 7.9, 11. Paul rejoy∣ced at this symptome in his patients at Corinth: Now I rejoyce not that
yee were made sorrie, but that yee sorrowed to repentance: for behold this selfe same thing that yee sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulnesse it wrought in you, &c. What shall we doe to satisfie the Father for the death of his Sonne, to ease our burthened consciences, to wash away the guilt of the effusion of innocent bloud? Behold here the effects of soule-ravishing eloquence, at∣tention, compunction, and a sollicitous enquiry after the meanes of ever∣lasting salvation: or if yee like better of an allegoricall partition, see here, 1. The weapon wherewith they were wounded, the Word prea∣ched, when they heard, &c. 2. The wound, which was a pricke at the heart. 3. The cure, not words but deeds, they said, what shall we doe? Here yee have a patterne, both of a faithfull teacher and religious hea∣rers; a faithfull teacher tickleth not the eares, but pricketh the heart; his words are not like bodkins to curle the haire, but like goads and nailes that pricke the heart; though the goads goe not so deepe that pierce but the skin, the nailes goe farther, for they are driven to the very heart of the au∣ditors up to the head. The religious hearer, when he is reproved for his sin, spurneth not at the Minister of God, but receiving the words with meek∣nesse, communeth with his owne heart whether the reproofe were just or no, and finding it just, confesseth his sinne, and seeketh for pardon and for∣givenesse. The Jewes here when they were charged by S. Peter with the murder of the sonne of God, say not, Quid hic? sed quid nos? not what hath this man to meddle with us? but who can give us good counsell? not what shall we say? but what shall wee doe? for words are too light a recom∣pence for deeds. 1. A word of the duty of faithfull teachers, that with the cocke, by clap∣ping my wings upon my breast, I may awake my selfe as well as others. The salvation of the hearers much dependeth upon the gifts of the Preacher, and the gifts of the Preacher much depend upon his sincere intention, not to gaine profit orSalvianus de gubernat. Dei, lib. 1. Utilia magis quam plausibilia se∣ctari, nec le∣nocinia quae∣rere sed reme∣dia. applause to himselfe, but soules to God: not to tickle their eares, but to pricke their hearts. Such a PreacherBern. in Cant. Illius doctoris vo∣cem libentiùs audio, non qui sibi plausum, sed qui mihi planctum mo∣vet. S. Bernard ever wished to heare, at whose Sermon the people hemmed not, but sighed; clapped not their hands as at a play, but knocked their breasts as at a funerall. Ac∣cording to which patterneHieron. Ne∣pot. Te docen∣te in ecclesiâ, non clamor populi, sed gemitus susci∣piatur; lachry∣mae auditorum tuae laudes sint. S. Jerome endevoureth to frame Nepotian his scholar, When thou teachest in the Church (saith hee) let there bee heard no shouts of admiration, but sobs of contrition: let the fluencie of thy eloquence be seene in the cheekes of thy hearers. This is not done by ostentation of art, but by evidence of the spirit. A painted fire heateth not, nor doe the ge∣stures and motions of an artificiall man, destitute of soule and life, any whit move our affections: , they are the graces of sanctification shining in the countenance, gesture, & life of the Preacher (and not the beauty and ornaments of speech) which insinuate into the heart, and multiply themselves there: without which, though wee speake with the tongues of men and Angels, wee are but like sounding brasse or tinckling cym∣bals: except the Lord touch the heart and the tongue of the Preacher with a coale from his Altar, all the lustre of rhetoricall arguments, and blaze of words, will yeeld no more warmth to the conscience than a glow-worme.
Yee have heard briefly of the duty of Pastours, reserve (I pray you) one eare to listen to your owne duty as hearers. 2. It was the manner of the Jewes to bore thorow the eares of those ser∣vants that meant not to leave them till death: and if yee desire to be in the lists of Gods servants, yee must have your eares bored, and the pearles of the Gospel hanging at them. All shepherds set a marke upon their sheepe; and so doth the good Shepherd that gave his life for his sheepe: and this marke is in the eare,Joh. 10.3, 27. My sheepe heare my voyce. There is no doctrine in the word wee heare of more often, than of hearing the word and keeping it. We heare that we ought to heare the Father;Esay 1.1. Heare O heaven, and hearken O earth, for the Lord hath spoken: we heare that we ought to heare the Son;Mat. 13.43. Mat. 17.5. He that hath eares to heare let him heare: and, This is my well-beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, heare yee him: we heare that wee ought to heare the Spirit;Apoc. 2.7. Let him that hath an eare to heare, heare what the Spirit saith to the Churches. All the venturers in the great ship called Argonavis, bound for Colchis to fetch the golden fleece, when they were assaulted by the Sy∣rens, endevouring to enchant them with their songs, found no such help in any thing against them, as in Orpheus his pipe: wee are all venturers for a golden crowne in heaven, and as the Grecians, so wee are way-laid by Sy∣rens, evill spirits, and their incantations, from which we cannot be safe, but by listening to the Preachers of the Gospel, who when they pipe unto us out of the word, our hearts dance for joy. In that golden chaine of the Apo∣stle, the first linke is hung at the eare, Faith commeth byRom. 10.14, 17. hearing, and hea∣ring by the word of God. How shall they call on him, on whom they have not be∣leeved? and how shall they beleeve in him, of whom they have not heard? and how shall they heare without a Preacher? Doe we think that God will heare us in our prayers, if wee heare not him speaking to us in his Word? The ProphetZach. 7.13. Zacharie assureth us hee will not: When I cried they would not heare, so they cried and I would not heare them, saith the Lord of hosts. If yee desire with S. Paul to heare in heaven, , the2 Cor. 12.4. words that cannot be uttered, ye must on earth be attentive hearers to the words ut∣tered by our Peters and Pauls. None was cured with more difficulty (as it seemeth) than the man that had a deafe and dumb spirit: such are our ob∣stinate Recusants and Seperatists, who have not an eare to heare what God speaketh to them by the Ministers of the Word. Religion is not unfitly compared to the Weasell,Adrian. Jun. emblem. Mu∣stella concipit aure, parit ore. which, as Adrianus Junius writeth, conceiveth at the eare, and brings forth her young ones at her mouth: for the seed of Gods word is cast in at the eare, and there having conceived divine thoughts and meditations, she bringeth forth the fruit of devotion at her mouth, praises and thanksgivings, godly admonitions, exhortations, reprehensions and consolations. Marke your Jaylers, they often suffer their prisoners to have their hands and feet free; neither are they in any feare that they will make an escape, so long as the prison doores and gates are sure lockt and fast bar∣red: so dealeth Satan with those whom hee holdeth in captivity, hee let∣teth them sometimes have their hands at liberty to reach out an almes to the poore, and sometimes their feet to goe to Church to heare prayers; but he will be sure to keepe the eares, which are the gates and doores of their soule, fast: which he locks up with these or the like suggestions. Christ
saith that his house is Domus orationis, not orationum, an house of prayer, not of sermons. Few there are but know enough, the greatest defect is in the practice of religious duties: What can they heare which they have not often heard before, which no sooner entreth in at one eare, but runneth out at the other? Give mee leave a little to lift these Adders from the ground, whereby they stop the right eare, and plucke their taile from the head, whereby they stop the left, that they may be charmed both by the word and by the voyce of reason it selfe. Christ saith his house is an house of prayer: but where spake hee this? spake he it not in the Temple? and were not these very words part of a sermon which hee preached to the buyers and sellers there? Hee hath but little skill in the language of Canaan, who knoweth not that prayer and invocation of Gods name, is in Scripture by a Synecdoche taken for the wholeActs 2.21. Rom. 10.13. Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, &c. worship of God: yet admit that our Saviour should in that place take prayers strictly, for that part of Gods worship which consisteth in lifting up our hands, to preferre our petitions and supplications unto him; S. Paul furnisheth us with a direct answer to this objection, even by those questions he propoundeth,Rom. 10.14. How then shall they call on him, on whom they have not beleveed? how shall they beleeve on him, of whom they have not heard? and how shall they heare without a preacher? As there is no powerfull prea∣ching without prayer to God for a blessing upon it: so no good prayer without preaching, to direct both in the matter and forme, and to enflame our hearts with zeale. There being three parts of prayer, humble confes∣sion, confident invocation, and hearty thanksgiving; how can they make a full confession of their sinnes, who learne not what are sinnes from the mouth of the Preacher? How can they bee humbled in such sort as they ought, before whom the Preacher out of the word setteth not God his ter∣rible name, glorious Majestie, all-seeing eye, infinite purity, strict justice, fierce wrath against sin, together with man his vilenesse, wretchednesse, sin∣fulnesse, wants and infirmities? How can they call upon God with confi∣dence, who are not perswaded out of the Word by the Preacher, of God his love to man, mercie and long-suffering, gratious promises, omnipo∣tent goodnesse; as also of Christ his perfect obedience, plenary satisfa∣ction, and perpetuall intercession? How can they recount Gods blessings, both spirituall and temporall, who never have beene told them by the Preacher? Yea but they will say they know enough of these things: nihil est dictum quod non sit dictum prius. This very objection of theirs bewrayes their ig∣norance and want of knowledge in divine things. For were they rightly in∣structed as they ought to be, they could not but know that the Scripture is like a plentifull mine, in which the deeper we digge, the veine of heavenly truthes proves still the richer; they would know that all the Saints of God in all ages have complained of, and confessed their ignorance, and continu∣ally praied with David, Doce me viam statutorum tuorum, O teach me the way of thy statutes, and open mine eyes, that I may see the wonderfull things of thy law. Lastly, that it is the duty of every good Christian toAmbros. de Offic. l. 1. Et quantumvis quisque profe∣cerit, nemo est qui doceri non queat donec vivit. improve his ta∣lent of wisedome and spirituall understanding, to1 Tim. 4.15. meditate on those things he readeth and heareth, that his profiting may appeare unto all; and to2 Pet. 3.18. grow
in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Admit they should learne no new thing in divers Sermons, yet will not this any way excuse their neglect of this duty of hearing; neither ought it to be a∣ny cause at all to keepe them from Sermons: because instruction of ignorance is not the onely end of preaching, there are many others; as, to glorifie God, to countenance the ministerie of his word by their presence, to en∣courage others to the diligent and constant hearing of the word by their ex∣ample, who perhaps may more need instruction than themselves; to testifie their obedience to Gods ordinance, who commandeth all his servants, as well to heare him when he speaketh to them in his Word, as to speake un∣to him in their prayers; to have religious affections stirred up in them, some∣times hope, sometimes feare, sometimes godly sorrow, sometimes spiritu∣all joy, alwayes zeale for Gods glorie, fervour in their devotion, and watch∣fulnesse over all their wayes: to be put in minde of those things which in∣deed they knew before, but either forgot, or made as little use of them as if they had never knowne them: to be awaked out of their spirituall lethargie: to be admonished of divers dangers they are like to incurre: to be convin∣ced of divers errours which they count to be none till the powerfull mini∣stry of the Word hath demonstrated them to be such: to reprove them of the sins they daily commit, as well of ignorance as against their conscience: and to pricke their hearts deep with godly compunction, that with weeping eyes and bleeding hearts they may seek to God in time for pardon. Lastly, to prepare them to performe all religious duties in a better maner, that they may for the future receive more comfort in their private devotions, and more benefit by the publike ministry of the Word and Sacraments. The grand enemie of our soules, partly by immediate suggestions and thoughts ingested into our mindes, and partly by the mouthes or pennes of Atheists, Infidels, Heretickes and Schismatickes, layeth new batteries against our most holy faith: and is it not then most needfull to learne from the most able and experienced Souldiers of Christ how to beat them off, and fortifie against them? And if their memorie be so brittle and pertuse, as they pretend, that it will hold nothing, there is a greater necessitie for them to heare oftener than others, that the frequent inculcation of the same doctrine may imprint that in their mindes which others receive by the first hearing. And to an∣swer them in their owne metaphor; albeit the bucket be so full of holes that all the water they take up in it runneth out, yet certainely the often dipping it into the Well, and filling it with water, will make it moister than other∣wise it would have beene. And so I passe from the eare marke of Christs sheepe, to the marke in their heart. They were pricked in heart. This pricke in the heart may be considered two manner of wayes: 1 In a reference to the cause, and so it is an effect. 2 In a reference to the subject, and so it is an affection. If wee consider it as an effect, it sheweth unto us the efficacie of Gods Word in the mind of the hearers, which is far greater than any force of hu∣mane art or eloquence. Art and humane eloquence may move affection, but it is the powerfull preaching of the Word only that can remove corruption; as we read, Lex Jehovae convertens animas,Psal. 19.7. The law of the Lord is perfect,
converting the soule. The word of man my tickle the eare, but it is the word of God onely which pricketh deepe the heart. Hence it is compared to a goad,Eccles. 12.11. or naile fastened by the masters of the assemblies: nay to aHeb. 4.12. two-edged sword, piercing to the dividing asunder of soule, and spirit, and joynts, and marrow: nay to thunder, which breaketh the bones, not hurting the yeel∣ding flesh; at the sound whereofLuke 10.18. Satan fals like lightening from heaven. This efficacie of the word of God proves the Divinitie thereof: as it could not be divine, but it must needs be effectuall; so it could not be so effectuall as it is, if it were not divine. As the demolishing the wals of Jericho pro∣ved that there was something more in the sounding of the Rams hornes, than the violent expulsion or percussion of the aire; so the conquering all the eloquence, and power, and wealth, and wisdome of the world, and sub∣duing it to the Gospel by the preaching of the Apostles, poore, simple, and illiterate men, of no more account (in comparison of the Oratours and Philosophers of the heathen) than the Rams hornes in comparison of sil∣ver trumpets, demonstrateth that their words were not the words of men, but the words of God.Zab. Phys. Zabarel treating of nutrition in the stomacke, and perfect concoction, propoundeth this question; How commeth it to passe, that heat being but an accident and a simple qualitie, can digest our meat, sever the thicker parts from the thinner, turne the chylus into chymus, and chymus into bloud, and disperse this bloud into all parts? resolveth it thus, that Heat may be considered two wayes; either as it is a meere qualitie and accident, and so it hath but one simple operation; or as it is an instrument of the soule, and so it produceth all the effects above mentioned. In like man∣ner, if it be demanded how the word preached instructeth, correcteth, and comforteth, and maketh the man of God2 Tim. 3.17. perfect, and thorowly furnished to everie good worke: how it frameth and mouldeth the heart, how it prin∣teth it like a stamp, melteth it like fire, bruizeth it like a hammer, pricketh it like a naile, and cutteth it asunder like a sword: the ready answer is, that it produceth these effects, Non ut sonus, sed ut instrumentum Dei; not as it is a sound or a collision of the aire, but as it is an instrument of God: Or, to use the phrase of the Apostle, as it is theRom. 1.16. power of God unto salvation, to everie one that beleeveth. This power wee may easily beleeve to bee in the whole, when wee see such efficacie in one text.Junius in vita. Junius was reclaimed from Atheisme by casting his eye on the new Testament lying open in his study, and reading the first words of S. Johns Gospel; In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. These words which strucke such a reverence in the hearts of the heathenish Pla∣tonicks, that they wrote them in golden letters in their Churches, so ama∣zed him with the strange majestie of the stile, and profoundnesse of the mysteries therein contained, that hee never after entertained the least thought of his former atheisticall conceit. As Antony passing in his jour∣ney, and comming to a Chappell, heard the Priest read those words in the Gospel,Luke 18.22. If thou wilt be perfect, goe sell all that thou hast, and give to the poore, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: hee tooke the words as spoken to himselfe in particular, and fulfilling the precept of Christ accordingly, of a covetous worldling became a most holy recluse. What should I speake of S. Austine, who was strangely converted by hearing a voyce, saying;
Tolle, lege: & fastening his eies upon the first passage of Scripture he lighted upon, which was this,Rom. 13.13, 14. Let us walke honestly as in the day, not in gluttonie and drunkennesse, not in chambering and wantonnesse, not in strife and envy∣ing; but put yee on the Lord Jesus, and make no provision for the flesh, to ful∣fill the lusts thereof. No sooner was the verse read, than the worke of his conversion was finished, and a pious resolution for amendment of life set∣led in him.Aug. conf. l. 8. c. 12. Surgens ab Alypio ut flerem, de vici∣nâ domo audi∣vi vocem, Tol∣le, lege: tum cogitabam pue∣rine solebant tale aliquid cantare, nec occurrebat au∣divisse me. Us∣piam represso impetu lachry∣marū, surrexi, interpretans me divinitùs doceri codi∣cem aperire & legere. Itaque reversus ad lo∣cum ubi sede∣bat Alypius, ibi enim posu∣cram codicem, aperui & le∣gi in caput quo conjecti sunt oculi mei, Rom. 13. Non in comessati∣onibus, &c. Rem Alypio indicavi, petit videre quod legissem, & ostendit ultrà quàm ego lege∣ram quod se∣quitur, Infirmū in fide assumi∣te, quod ille ad se retulit. Alypius certified hereof, desireth to peruse the place, and falleth upon the verse immediately following; Him that is weake in the faith receive you, (Rom. 14.1.) which he applying to himselfe, besought S. Au∣stine to strengthen him in the truth, according to the command of Christ to Peter, Luke 22.32. Tu conversus, confirma fratres, When thou art conver∣ted, confirme thy brethren: which taske he so well performed, that with a lit∣tle travell, in a short space two twins were brought forth to Christ at one birth. To fasten the truth of this observation, concerning the efficacie of Scripture texts seasonably applyed, I will borrow a golden naile from S. Chrysostome: It is not so in the Church where the Word is powerfully taught, as it was in the Arke of Noah: for there the beast that entred into the Arke, received no change nor alteration at all by the imbarking there during the de∣luge: if they were cleane at their comming in, they were so at their going out; if they came in uncleane, they went out uncleane; if they came in wilde, they went out wilde: but it is not so here: we come in uncleane, but we goe out cleane; we come in wild, we goe out tame; wee come in wolves, wee goe out lambs; we come in lions, we goe out deere; we come in vultures, wee goe out doves; we come in beasts, we goe out men; or, to speake more pro∣perly, regenerate Christians. And thus much concerning compunction in reference to the cause, as it is an effect of the word preached: now let us consider it in a reference to the subject, as it is an affection in the sinner. The locusts are described byApoc. 9.7, 10. S. John with faces like men, but stings in their tailes like scorpions: not to disparage any mysticall interpretation, a morall may be this: Sinnes, especially of pleasure, like these locusts, have beautifull faces, and a delightfull appearance at the first: but those that deale and dally with them, shall finde that they have stings in their tailes, and leave pricks and venomous wounds in the conscience in the end; for after the act of sinne is committed, there is felt in all that have not seared consciences, remorse, sorrow, feare, and shame: sorrow for the losse of Gods favour, & the jewels of his grace, & the comforts of the Spirit; feare for the guilt of sinne, and shame for the filthinesse and turpitude thereof. Of these three consisteth compunction; whichIn verbo com∣punct. Com∣punctio est humilitas mentis cum la∣chrymis, veni∣ens de recor∣datione pecca∣ti, & timore judicii. S. Isidore defineth to be a dejection of the minde, with teares caused by the remembrance of sinne, and feare of judgement. ByEx Aquinate in supplement. Humilitas mentis inter spem & timorem annihilans peccatum: nam ut vermis qui nascitur in ligno lig∣num exest, ita dolor ex peccato peccatum ipsum absumit. S. Gregorie thus, A dejection of the mind full of anxietie, betweene feare and hope, annihilating or destroying sinne. For as the worme which breedeth in the wood consumeth it, so (saith St Chrysostome) the sorrow which ariseth from sinne consumeth and destroyeth it. Pia proles hoc ipso quod devoret matrem, An happie issue in this onely, that it eateth out the heart of the parent. Thus I have pricked you out (to use the phrase of the Musitians) a lesson
of compunction; which though it be a sad pavin to the outward man, yet it is a merrie galliard to the inward. The physicke which kindly worketh, and maketh the patient heart-sicke for the present, yet much comforteth him out of assured hope, that the present pain will bring future ease & help. The smarting plaister is the most wholsome: such is that I have spread by the amplification of my Text, and now I am to lay it to by the application thereof. If compunction of the heart be the true marke of a penitent, let the eye of our soule look into our heart, and see whether we can find it there. If we find it, we may take comfort in it; if we find it not, we may be sure we are no true converts. There is no vertue in the physick, if it paine us not: no force in the plaister, if it smart not: the dis-located bone is not brought to his place, if we felt no pain in the setting it. As the colours and shapes which are burnt in glass, cannot be obliterated unless the glass be broken all to pieces; so neither can the ougly shapes of vices & images of Sathan be razed out of the soule, unlesse the heart be broken with true contrition. Spices when they are bruised and pownded in a mortar yeeld a most fragrant smell: O then let us bruise our hearts with true contrition,Tertul. de poenitent. Mi∣serum est secu∣ri & cauterio exuri, & pulvo∣ris alicujus mordacitate cruciari; atta∣men quae per insuaviem medentur, & emolumento curationis of∣fensam sui ex∣cusant, & prae∣sentem injuri∣am superveni∣entis utilitatis gratia com∣mendat. that our zealous meditations may be like fragrant spices in the nostrils of God. If the Jewes were pricked in heart at the remembrance of Christs suffering, if their hearts bled for once crucifying the Lord of life, how much more ought ours for crucifying him daily? O thinke upon this (dearly beloved) seriously both in the day and in the night, and let it make your beds to swim with teares. As often as ye sweare by the wounds of Christ, ye teare them wider: as often as ye belch out bla∣sphemy against God, ye spit upon your Saviours face: as often as ye distem∣per your selves with strong wines, ye give him vinegar to drink: as often as ye grieve the holy spirit, ye pricke his very heart: as often as yee unworthily receive the sacrament, ye tread his bloud under your feet. Me thinks I hear you sobbing and sighing out the words of the Jewes in my Text: If these things are so, if those sins are so hainous and grievous which we have made so light of, Men and brethren, what shall we doe? I answer you in the words of Saint Peter following: Repent, and be baptized every one of you; not in the font of sweet water in the Church, but in the salt water of your teares: let yourCypr. de laps. Alto vulneri diligens, & longa medici∣na ne desit poenitentia crimine minor non sit. sorrow be answerable to your sinfull pleasures, and bring forth fruits meet for repentance. The wound is deep, thrust the tent to the bottome of it; your sins have been many and grievous, let your teares bee abundant, and your sighes many. Yee have had a long time of sinning, give not over pre∣sently your exercises of mortification: hold on your strict abstinence, your devout prayers, your frequent watchings, your humble confessions, and sad meditations, the whole time which the Church hath prescribed you: by your sorrow here, prevent eternallTertul. de poenit. Fletu fletum, tem∣porali afflicti∣one aeterna supplicia ex∣pungite: in quantum non peperceritis vobis, in tan∣tum vobis par∣cet Deus. lamentations and woe: by your re∣morse of conscience here, prevent weeping and gnashing of teeth hereafter: by your temporall affliction in this world, prevent eternall malediction and endlesse torments of body and soule in hell: the lesse you spare your selves in this kind, God will spare you so much the more, and so much the sooner and easier be reconciled unto you. To whom, &c.
CHRISTIAN BROTHER-HOOD. A Sermon preached on the second Sunday in Lent. THE LXVIII. SERMON. ACTS 2.37. And they said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles; Men and brethren. MAny of the ancients write, that S. Luke was an excellent limmer, and drew the blessed Virgin to the life: how true it is that he tooke the picture of the mother of God, I know not (for the first relaters were Apocryphall writers) but sure I am, in this text as a table hee setteth forth the children of God in their colours, and describeth them by their proper marks: which are three; 1. In the eare. 2. In the heart. 3. In the hand. 1. The eare-marke is carefull attention, when they heard. 2. The heart-marke is deepe compunction, they were pricked in heart. 3. The hand-marke is sollicitous action, Men and brethren, what shall we doe? Wee have already viewed the eares of these converts, and found them bored thorow for the perpetuall service of God, and hung with the jewels of the Gospel: next we searched into their hearts, and found them pierced with sorrow for being some way accessarie (at least by consent) to the death of the Lord of life: and now wee are to looke to their hands, and see what they will doe, or rather what they will not bee willing to doe, to make their peace with God, and wash away the guilt of spilling his Sonnes bloud.
Men and brethren, what shall we doe? Ye heare (men and brethren) in this close of the verse 1. A courteous compellation, which savoureth of 1. Humanity, Men. Now they hold the Apostles men,Ver. 13. whom a little before they esteemed no better of than drunken beasts. 2. Charity, Brethren. Not aliens from the Common-wealth of Israel, not strangers. 2. An important question, which is a question of 1. Feare, What shall we doe to escape the wrath to come for that we have done? 2. Care, What shall we doe to make some part of amends for our crimson sinne, in shedding the bloud of that righteous and holy One? 3. Piety, What shall we doe that we may reape benefit by his death, whom ignorantly we slew with wicked hands? Thus have I chalked unto you the way of my present and future dis∣courses upon this Scripture, wherein I intreat your attention and devotion to goe along with mee, that I and you may first know in the speculative part what wee are to doe, and then in the practicke doe what wee know to be necessary for the obtaining the remission of our sins. Men. Is there not a Pleonasmus or redundancy in the words Men and Brethren? Is not this appellative men rather a burthen than an ornament to the sentence? Are there any brethren that are not men? Yes, if we will be∣leeve the Legend of Saint Francis: for he found a new alliance and brother∣hood amongst beasts, ordinarily saluting them in this manner when he met them, Brother Oxe, brother Beare, brother Wolfe (and it is marvell that the chronicles of his life related not that some of them resaluted him againe by the title of brother Asse for his labour.) But this is a note beneath Gammoth, and a degree below lowlinesse it selfe: for humility will admit none to be of her kinred and brotherhood, that beare not the image of God our Father. The beasts of the field are indeed fellow-creatures with us, but they are our juments and servants, no way our brethren. Was then the word men ad∣ded to intimate that such is the inhumanity or unmanlinesse of many, that a man may meet with many brethren by bloud, by alliance, by profession, by country, who yet deserve not the stile of men, because brethren without all humanity, and so no men: without heart or courage, and so no men: effe∣minate in their speech, habit, carriage, trim and dresse, and so no men? Nei∣ther can this be the meaning of the words. For the Jewes were not now in a Satyricall veine, but like men that had been newly let bloud by a deep in∣cision, they speake faintly, and in an humble manner beseech their Physici∣ans to prescribe what they must doe to recover their health. We are there∣fore to understand that in the originall there is no pleonasme, nor bitter sar∣casme, but an elegancie and an emphasis in our tongue: there is but one name for men of the better sort & inferiour ranke: but in greeke there are two,  the word here used, and , and they differ as much as ayre and earth, or christall and glasse, or pearle and stone: for  signifieth an ordinary man of the vulgar sort, but  a man of parts, a man of worth,
a man of note, a man full of humanity, pity, and compassion: and herein they secretly couch an argument, to induce the Apostles to take some care of their soules; as if they should say, Though ye are men of God, yet ye are men as we are: the divine graces in you bereave you not of humane passi∣ons. Suffer then not men as you are to be cast away, bring not the bloud of this righteous man upon us, pity us in this our perplexity, pray to God for us, advise us what we are to doe, stretch a hand of charity to us, to plucke us out of the chops of Sathan, and flames of hell fire. Me thinkes I should passe this note in so Christian an auditory, and not stand to prove that we ought to be men, not like beasts without reason, not like monsters without all bowels, without naturall affection and compas∣sion: yet were many that call themselves brethren men, could they grind the faces of the poore as they doe? could they not only tondere, but deglu∣bere, not only sheare, but flea Christs sheep? were they men, would they use men like beasts? would they make themselves beasts, and expresse the condition of the worst of beasts, by returning with the dogge to their vomit, and with the sow to their wallowing in the mire? are they men, who take greatest delight in drowning their reason, and extinguishing that light of understanding in them which maketh them men? are they men? have they hearts of flesh? have they eyes consisting of an aqueous humour, who suf∣fer men made after Gods image to pine away before their eyes for want of a crumme of their store, a graine of their magazine, a drop of their ocean, a mite of their treasury, a cluster of grapes of their vintage, a gleaning of their harvest? are they men, that never remember the affliction of Joseph, that ne∣ver thinke of the besieged in Rochel, of the persecuted in Bohemia and the Palatinate, and almost all parts of Germany, as good men as themselves, and better Christians, who endure either the violence of oppression, or the shame of infamy, or the servitude of captivity, or the insolency of tiranny, or the griping of famine, or the terrours of sundry kinds of death? It grieved the Oratour to proclaime , O my friends, there is no true friend among you: but it much more grieveth those that are to give an account of your soules, to be enforced to complaine, Men and brethren, there are few men or brethren among you, but few that deserve the name of men, and fewer of Brethren. They call the Apostles brethren, either in a kind of corre∣spondency of courtesie, because the Apostles so stiled them before (Men and brethren,Ver. 29. let mee freely speake unto you of the Patriarch David) or to insinuate themselves into their love;  quasi , co-uterini, sprigs issuing out of the same root, men issuing out of the same wombe, 1. Either of flesh, as brothers that have the same mother. 2. Or of the Church, as all that are new borne in it. 3. Or of the earth, as all men. Some who delight more in the sound of words than soundnesse of matter, make their cimbals thus tinckle in our eares: There are brethren (say they) of three sorts, either by race, as all of the same linage: or by place, as all of the same country or city: or by grace, as all of the same religion. But I like better of St.Cont. Helvid. c. 7. Scriptura divina dicit fratres, 1. natu∣râ, 2. gente, 3. cognatione, 4 affectu: quod postremum di∣viditur in spi∣rituale & com∣mune: spiri∣tuale, quo om∣nes Christiani fratres vocantur; commune, quo omnes homines ex uno patre nati pari inter se germanitate conjunguntur. Jeromes distinction of brethren: 1. by nature or bloud: 2. by
cognation or affinity: 3. by nation or country: 4. by love & affection: 1. com∣mon, to all men, the sons of Adam our father: 2. speciall, to all Christians, the sons of the same mother the Church. 1. Nature made Jacob and Esau brethren. 2. Affinity our Lord and James brethren. 3. Nation or country Peter and the Jewes brethren. 4. Affection and obligation 1. Spirituall, all Christians, 2. Carnall and common, all men brethren. Thus the significations of brother in Scripture, like the circles made by a stone cast into the water, not only multiply, but much enlarge themselves: the first is a narrow circle about the stone, the next fetcheth a bigger com∣passe, the third a greater & more capacious than it, the fourth so large that it toucheth the bankes of the river: in like manner, the first signification of brethren is confined to one house, nay to one bed and wombe, the second extendeth it selfe to all of one family or linage, the third to the whole nati∣on or country, the fourth and last to the utmost bounds of the earth. No name so frequently occurreth in Scripture as this of brethren, no love more often enforced than brotherly. We need not goe farre for emblemes there∣of,Plut. de a∣mor. fratr. Plutarch hath found many in our body: for wee have two eyes, two eares, two nostrills, two hands, two feet, which are, as hee termeth them, , brethren and twinne members, formed out of like matter, be∣ing of one shape, one bignesse, and serving to one and the selfe same use. Nature her selfe kindleth the fire of brotherly love in our hearts, and God by the blasts of his Spirit, and the breath of his Ministers bloweth it conti∣nually: yet in many it waxeth cold, and in some it seemeth to bee quite ex∣tinguished. Saint Paul prayed that the PhilippiansPhil. 1.9. love might abound more and more. Hee exhorteth the Hebrewes, Let brotherlyHeb. 13.1. love continue: but we need now-adaies to cast our exhortation into a new mold, and say, Let brotherly love begin in you. For were it begun, so many quarrells, so many factions, so many sects, so many broiles, so many law-suites would not be begun as we see every day, set on foot. Did we looke upon the badge of our livery, which is mutuallJohn 13.35. By this all men shall know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one an∣ther. love, we would cry shame of our selves for that which we see and heare every day, such out-cries, such railing, such cur∣sing, such threatning, such banding opprobrious speeches, such challenges into the field, and spilling the bloud of those for whom Christ shed his most precious bloud. Is it not strange that they should fall foule one upon another, who have bin both washed in the same laver of regeneration? that they should thirst after one anothers bloud, who drinke of the same cup of benediction? that they should lift their hands up one against another, for whom Christ spread his hands upon the crosse? Let there be noGen. 13.8. falling out between mee and thee (saith Abraham to Lot) for wee are brethren. Let mee presse you further, & touch you neerer to the quick▪ Let there be no strife among you; for you are members one of another: nay, which is more, Yee are all members of Christ Jesus. What? members of Christ, and spurne one at another? members of Christ, and buffet one another? members of Christ, and supplant one another? members of Christ, and devoure one another? members of Christ, and destroy one another? It is true as
Plutarch observeth, that the neerer the tye is the fouler the breach. As bodies that are but glewed together, if they be severed or rent asunder, they may be glewed as fast as ever they were; but corpora continua, as flesh and sinewes, if any cut or rupture be made in them, they cannot bee so joyned together againe, but a scarre will remaine: so those who are onely glewed together by some civill respects, may fall out and fall in againe, without a∣ny great impeachment to their reputation or former friendship; but they who are tied together by nerves and sinewes of naturall or spirituall obli∣gation, and made one flesh or spirit together, if there fall any breach be∣tween them, it cannot be so fairely made up, but that like the putting a new peece of cloth into an old garment, the going about to piece or reconcile them maketh the rent worse. WhenCic. famil. ep. l. 9. Noli pati litigre fra∣tres, & judiciis turpius con∣flictari. Tully understood of a suit in law commenced between Quintus and M. Fabius, hee earnestly wrote to Papirius to take up the matter:Cic. famil. ep. l. 9. Noli pati litigre fra∣tres, & judiciis turpius con∣flictari. Suffer not (saith hee) brethren to implead one another. For though suits about title of lands seem to be the fairest of any, yet even these are foule among brethren: wherefore (my beloved brethren) let us 1. Prevent all occasions of difference: let there be no tindar of malice in our hearts ready to take fire upon the flying of the least sparke into it: let us so root and ground our selves in love, that no small offence may stirre us: let us endeavour by all friendly offices so to endeare our selves to our bre∣thren, and so fasten all naturall and civill ties by religious obligations, that we alwaies keep theEphes. 4.3. unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 2. If it cannot be but that offences will come and distract us, if the Divell or his agents cast a fire-brand among us, let us all runne presently to quench it: let us imitate wise Mariners, who as soone as they spie a leake spring in the ship, stop it with all speed, before it grow wider, and endanger the drowning of the vessell. 3. After the breach is made up, and the wound closed and healed, let us not rub upon the old sore, according to the rule ofCoel. Rodig. antiq. lect. l. 16. & 19. Pythagoras, Ignem gla∣dio ne fodias, let us not rake into the ashes or embers of the fire of contention lately put out. As we pray that God may cast our sinnes, so let us cast our brothers trespasses against us into theMicah 7.19 bottome of the sea. The Athenians (asPlut. lib. de fraterno amo∣e. Plutarch writeth) tooke one day from the moneth of May, and razed it out of all their Calenders, because on that day Neptune and Minerva fell out one with another; even so let us Christians much more bury those daies in perpetuall oblivion, & strike them out of our Almanacks, in which any bloudy fray or bitter contention hath fallen among us. For our Father is the God of peace: our Saviour is the Prince of peace: our Comforter is the Spirit of peace and love. God who isJohn 4.8. love, and of his love hath begot us, loveth nothing more in the children of his love, than the mutuall love of his children one to another.Mat. 23.8. Ye are all brethren: love therefore as brethren, be pitifull, be courteous, not rendering evill for evill, nor railing for railing; but contrariwise1 Pet 3.8, 9. blessing, knowing that yee are thereunto called, that yee should inherit a blessing. As beames of the same sunne, let us meet in the center of light: as rivelets of the same spring, joyne in the source of grace: as sprigs on the same root, or twins on the same stalke, sticke alwaies toge∣ther. Such was the love of the Saints of God in old time, that their hearts were knit one to the other: yea, which is more, All the beleevers had butActs 4.32. The multitude of them that beleeved, were of one heart, & of one soule. one
heart. But such love is not now to be found in our bookes, much lesse in our conversations: we hardly beleeve there can be such love in beleevers; we seem not to be of their race, wee seem rather to be descended many of us from Coelius, who could not be quiet if he were not in quarrells; who was angry if he were not provoked to anger: whose motto was, Dic ali∣quid, ut duo simus; Say or doe something, that we may be two: or from Syl∣la, of whom Valerius Maximus writeth, that it was a great question whe∣ther he or his malice first expired: for he died railing, and railed dying: or of Eteocles and Polynices, who as they warred all their life, so after a sort they expressed their discord and dissention after their death: for at their fu∣nerals the flame of the dead corpses parted asunder when they were burned. When the Son of man commeth, shall hee findLuke 18.8. faith on the earth (saith our Saviour?) I feare we may demand rather, shall he find charity on the earth? All the true family of love may seem to be extinct: for the greater part of men, as if they had been baptized in the waters of strife, from the font to their tomb-stone are in continuall frettings, vexings, quarrells, schisme and faction. Turba gravis paci placidaeque inimica quieti. But let these Salamanders, which live perpetually in the fire of contention, take heed, lest without speedy repentance they be cast into the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone forever. IfMat. 5.9. blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God; cursed are all make-bates, for they shall be called the children of the wicked one. If the fruits ofJam. 3.18. righte∣ousnesse are sowne in peace of them that make peace, certainly the fruits of ini∣quity are sowne in contention by them that stirre up strife and contention. If they that sowPro. 6.16, 19. These sixe things doth the Lord hate, yea seven are abo∣mination unto him: a false witnesse that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among bre∣thren. discord among brethren are an abomination to the Lord, they that plant love and set concord are his chiefe delight. WhatCic. tusc. 1. Optimum non nasci, proxi∣mum quàm ci∣tissimè mori. Silenus spake of the life of man, The best thing was not to be borne, the next to dye as soone as might be, may bee fitly applyed to all quarrells and contentions a∣mong Christian brethren; it is the happiest thing of all that such dissenti∣ons never see light: the next is, if they arise and come into the Christian world, that they dye suddenly after their birth; at the most let them be but like those , small creatures Aristotle speaketh of, whose life ex∣ceedeth not a summers day. Let not theEphes. 4.26. sun goe down upon our wrath. How can we long be at odds and distance, if we consider that we are all brethren by both sides? For as we call one God our Father, so we acknowledge one Church our Mother: wee have all sucked the same breasts, the Old and New Testaments: we are all bred up in the same schoole, the schoole of the crosse: we are all fed at the same table, the Lords board: we are all in∣corporated into one society, the communion of Saints; and made joynt-heires with our elder brother Christ Jesus of one Kingdome in Heaven. If these and the like considerations cannot knit our hearts together in love, which is the bond of perfection, the Heathen shall rise up in judgement and condemne us.Mart. epig. lib. 1. Si Lucane ti∣bi, vel si tibi, Tulle, daren∣tur, Qualia Le∣daei fata Laco∣nes habent, &c. Martial writeth of two brothers, between whom there was never any contention but this, who should die one for the other: Nobilis haec esset pietatis rixa duobus, Quod pro fratre mori vellet uterque prior.
The speech also of Pollux to Castor his brother is remarkable, Mart. epig. lib. 1.Vive tuo, frater, tempore, vive meo. I cannot let passe Antiochus, who when he heard that his brother Seleu∣chus, who had been up in armes against him, died at Galata, commanded all the Court to mourne for him; but when afterwards hee was more cer∣tainly enformed that he was alive, and levied a great army against him, he commanded all his Commanders and chiefe Captaines to sacrifice to their gods, & crown themselves with garlands for joy that his brother was alive. But above all,Plut. de fra∣terno amore. Euclid shewed in himselfe the true symptomes of brotherly affection, who when his brother in his rage made a rash vow, Let me not live if I be not revenged of my brother, Euclid turnes the speech the contrary way, Nay, let me not live if I be not reconciled to my brother; let me not live if we be not made as good friends as ever before. Shall nature be stronger than grace? bonds of flesh tie surer than the bonds of the spirit? one tie knit hearts together faster than many? TheCic. offic. l. 1. Oratour saith, Omnes omnium cha∣ritates patria complectitur; but we may say more truly, Omnes omnium cha∣ritates Christus complectitur, all bonds of love, friendship, affinity and con∣sanguinity, all neernesse and dearnesse, all that can make increase or continue love, is in Christ Jesus, into whose spirit we are all baptized, into whose body we are incorporated, who in his love sacrificed himselfe to his Fathers ju∣stice for us, who giveth his body and bloud to us in this sacrament to nou∣rish Christian love in us. For therefore we all eate of one bread, that we may be made one bread; therefore wee are made partakers of his naturall body, that wee may be all made one mysticall body, and all quickned with one spirit, that spirit which raised up our head Christ Jesus from the dead. Cui, cum Patre, &c.
THE PERPLEXED SOULES QUAERE. A Sermon preached on the third Sunday in Lent. THE LXIX. SERMON. ACTS 2.37. What shall we doe? THe words of the wise (saithEccles. 12.11. Solomon the mirrour of wisedome) are like to goades, and to nailes fastned by the masters of the assemblies, which are given from one shepheard. Marke, I beseech you, what he saith, and the Lord give you a right understanding in all things: hee saith not, verba sapientum sunt calamistri, but stimuli: notSalvianus de prov. l. 1. cap. 1. lenocinia, sed remedia; not sweet powders, but medicines: not crisping pins to curle the lockes, or set the haires in equipage, but like goades piercing through the thicke skinne, and like nailes pricking the live flesh, yea the very heart roote, and drawing from thence teares, sanguinem animae, theAug. Serm. de temp. Lachry∣mae sanguis animae. blood of the wounded soule. Such were the words of Saint Peter in this Sermon, where∣with he tickleth not the eares of the Jewes with numerous elocution, but pricked their hearts with godly compunction. Which effects of his di∣vine and soule-ravishing eloquence, Saint Luke punctually noteth (as MrIn. Act. c. 2. Concionis fru∣ctum refert Lucas, ut scra∣mus non modo in lingurum varietate exr∣tam fuisse spi∣ritus sancti vir∣tutem, sed in eorum etiam cordibus qui credebant. Calvin judiciously hath observed) that we might not thinke that the holy Ghost, which came downe upon the Apostles in the likenesse of fierie tongues, and enabled them to speake divers languages which they had never learned, resided in the tongue, but descended lower into the heart, and wrought there a won∣derfull alteration, of stony making them fleshie; of obdurate, relenting; of
obstinate, yeelding; of frozen, melting. Tully doth but flatter his mistresse eloquence in proclaiming her flexanimam, Queene regent of the affections of the mind. That style is due to the power of the word and the grace of the spirit, which boweth and bendeth, frameth and moldeth the heart at pleasure. It is the swordHeb. 4.12. of the spirit which is mightie in operation, & carnem mortificat, & Deo in sacrificium offert; killeth the flesh in us, and sacrificeth it unto God. It is the point of this sword which openeth the Aposteme of cor∣rupt nature, and letteth out all the impure matter of lust and luxurie, by pricking the quickest veines in the heart. Wherefore that wanton and crank dame, who blushed not to professe that she was more moved at a play than at a Sermon, either by that profane speech of hers bewrayed that she play∣ed at Sermons, & never fastened her eares to the Preacher, that he might fa∣sten his goads and nailes in her heart; orMercenar. phys. dilucid. obscus. dict. Aristot. intus apparens prohibuit extrane∣um, the evill spirit had before taken up her heart, as he did a like gallants in Rome, who, asLi. despectac. Tertullian writeth, when he was adjured by a Saint of God, and demanded how hee durst seize upon any that professed the Christian faith, answered, In meo reperi, I caught her in my owne ground, I found her at the Theater, she came within my walke, and therefore I tooke her as a lawfull prize: or lastly, shee never came prepared to the hearing of the Word as she ought, she never laid her heart asoake in teares to make it ten∣der, she never prayed to God to direct the penknife in the hand of the spi∣rituall Chirurgian, to pricke the right veine by a seasonable reprehension like to this of Saint Peters in my text, which when the Jewes heard, They were pricked in heart, &c. See (saith SaintChrys. in Act. Homil. 5. . ib. , &c. Chrysostome) what meek∣nesse is, and how it pierceth the heart deeper than rigour and severitie of re∣proofe. It is not the storme of haile and raine that ratleth upon the tiles, and maketh such a noise, but the still kinde shower that sinketh deepe into the earth; the soft drops pierce the hard stones. . The Surgeon who intends to pricke a veine deepe, first stroakes the flesh, and gently rubbeth it to make the veine swell. He that maketh an incision in the body of a patient that hath tough and hard flesh, putteth him to little or no paine at all: but if hee mollifie the flesh first, and then apply his sharpe instrument unto it, the party shrinketh at it: even so saith the skilfull Surgeon of the mind sores, If we would doe good upon our patients, wee must first make the heart tender, and then pricke it: now that which mollifieth the heart, and maketh it tender, is not rage, nor heate of passion, nor vehement ac∣cusation, much lesse bitter taunts and reproaches, but theGal. 6.1. spirit of meeknesse; in which Saint Peter sought to restore his countrimen the Jews. For though they had murdered his and our Lord and Master, and much injured his fel∣low servants the Apostles, yet he speaketh unto them as a father or a carefull master; he telleth them indeed of their fault, yet aggravateth it not, that he might not drive them to desperate courses; but excusing it by their igno∣rance, he offereth them grace and pardon upon very easie termes, that grie∣ving for their sinnes of a deeper die, they would looke upon him by faith whom they had pierced, and with wicked hands nailed to a tree. By which sweet insinuation, though he brought them not so farre as to justifying faith
and repentance unto life, yet they came on a good way; for they were pric∣ked with remorse for that they had done, and they expresse a desire to make amends, if it might be, and referre themselves to the Apostles farther dire∣ction and instruction, saying, Men and brethren What shall we doe? I may say of this question, as Tully of Brutus hisCic. famil. epist. laconicall epistle, quàm multa quàm paucis? how much in how little? but two words in the. origi∣nall, yet issuing from three affections, feare, sorrow, and hope. 1 Feare saith, What shall we doe to flie from the wrath to come? 2 Sorrow saith, What shall we doe to undoe that we have done? 3 Hope saith, What shall we doe to purchase a pardon for our bloudy mindes, if not hands, and to obtaine the promise that you tell us is made to us, and to our children? First of these words as they are a question of feare. The tree of forbidden sinne beareth three fruits, and all bitter, 1 Guilt. 2 Losse. 3 Turpitude. And these fruits breed in the sto∣macke of the soule three maladies, 1 Shame. 2 Sorrow. 3 Feare. 1 The turpitude in it or deformity breedeth shame. 2 The losse by it breedeth hearts-griefe and sorrow. 3 The guilt of it breedeth terrours and feares. Peradventure some man may be found so armed with proofe of impuden∣cie, that he cannot be wounded with shame: and wee see many so intoxica∣ted with the present delight of sinne, and so insensible of the losse by it, that they take no griefe or thought for it. But I never yet read or heard of any that sinned with a high hand, but his owne heart smote him with feare. For where sinne is of a deepe die, not washed out with penitent teares, there is guilt; where guilt is, there must needs be an expectation of condigne pu∣nishment; and where this expectation is, continuall feare. The sinners con∣science tells him that his fact is unjust, and God is just, and therefore in ju∣stice will give injustice his just reward, either in this life, or in that which is to come. As Antipho through a disease in his eye, thought that he had his owne Image alwayes before him: so he that hath charged his conscience with any abominable, or very foule and bloudy crime, seeth alwayes before him the ougly image of his sinne, and hideous shape of his deserved pu∣nishment. Hae sunt impiis assiduae domesticaeque furiae:Cic pro Rose. Amer. these are the ghosts that haunt wicked men, these are the furies that follow them with torches, and scorch them with flashes of hell fire: these suffer them not, non modo sine cura quiescere, sed ne spirare quidem sine metu: these make them flie when no man pursueth them, cry when no man smiteth-them, quake when no man threatneth them, languish in a cold sweat when no fit is upon them. Juvenal sat. 17.—frigidamens est Criminibus, tacitâ sudant praecordia culpâ. WhenCic. ib. Sua quem{que} fraus, & suus terror maxime vexar: suum quemque sclus agitat, suae mal cogi∣tationes con∣sientiaeque a∣nimi terrent. they are alone and quiet, out of all other noise, they heare their
sinne cry for vengeance. At which huy and cry they are so startled, that though many be sometimes free from the cause of their feare, yet they are never free from feare of danger. Every shadow they take for a man, every man for a spie, every spie for an accuser. As in a fever, the greater the fit is, the more vehement the shaking: so the more horrid the sinne is, the more horrible the dread. The sinne of the Jewes in giving consent to the saving of a murderer and the murther of the Saviour, is beyond comparison, and therefore their feare beyond measure. As a child that hath committed some great fault, and expecteth to bee fleaed for it, cryeth to his master, What shall I doe? Or a passenger suddenly benighted, when he perceiveth that he is riding downe a steepe rocke, cryeth to all within hearing, Oh what shall I doe? Or a patient that is in a desperate case feeleth unsufferable paine, and apprehendeth no meanes of ease, cryeth to his physician, What shall I doe? Or a seafaring man in a storme in the night, when he heareth the water roare, and feareth every moment to be swallowed up in the sea, cry∣eth to the Pilot, What shall we doe? In this perplexitie, in this fright, in this agonie are the Jewes in my text; and from hence is this speech of distracted men, What shall we doe? This their feare ought to strike a terrour in us all, who have our part in their guilt; for we by our sinnes have and doe provoke the Father, grieve the Spirit, and even crucifie againe the Sonne: how can wee then but feare when we heare Gods threats against sinne? when we see daily his judge∣ments upon sinne? when wee remember our Saviours sufferings to satisfie Gods justice for sinne? How dare we draw iniquity with cords, and sinne with cart-ropes? How dare we kicke against the pricks? How dare we make a covenant with death, and league with hell? How dare wee hatch the cockatrice egge? How dare wee lie at the mouth of the Lions den? Let no man say in his heart when he plotteth wickednesse, or committeth filthi∣nesse in the darke, no eye seeth mee, and therefore what need I feare? for hee that hath eyes like a flame of fire, pierceth the thickest darknesse, and disco∣vereth every hidden roome in thy house, and corner in thy heart: hee seeth thee in secret, and will reward thee openly, if thou by smiting thine owne heart prevent not his blowes, as the Jewes did in my text, saying, What shall we doe? This interrogation riseth from three springs or heads: 1 Feare of punishment. 2 Sorrow for sinne. 3 Hope of pardon. A man in feare driven to an exigent, being now at his wits end saith with himselfe, What shall I doe? likewise, a man overwhelmed with cares, and ready to be drowned in sorrow, as hee is sinking cries, Oh! what shall I doe, or what will become of mee? The fruit of sin is sweete in the mouth, but bitter in the stomacke: like poison given in a sugred cup it goeth downe sweetly, but it kindleth a fire in the bowels: it tickleth the heart in the be∣ginning, but it prickes it in the end: it is pleasure in doing, it is sorrow when it is done. Saint Bernard speaketh feelingly, Sinne after it is perpetrated leaves in the soule a sad farewell: amara & foeda vestigia, where the divell hath set his foote there remaines after he is gone a foule print, and a stinking sent. Though the sinner use all meanes to dead the flesh of his heart, though
he make it as hard as flint, or the nether milstone, yet conscience writeth in it, as with the point of a Diamond, this sentence of the eternall Judge of quick and dead,Rom. 2.9. Tribulation and anguish upon every soule that sinneth. They that stabbed Caesar, afterwards turned the point of the same dagger upon themselves: so it is certaine that no man by sin grieveth Gods Spirit, but he woundeth himselfe with sorrow. If the sprayning a veine, or dis-locating a bone, or putting a member out of joynt, or distempering the bloud, be a pain to the body: how much more is the distorting the will, the disordering the affections, the quenching the light of reason by sinne, a torment to the soule? There is no man that hath not lost his senses, but hath sense of great losses: & what losse comparable to the losse of Gods favour and love, the comforts of the spirit, and the treasures of his grace? Though a sinner should gaine the whole world by his sinne, yet would hee be a loser: for at the present he hazzardeth, and without mature repentance he loseth his owne soule. To speake nothing of losse of time by idlenesse, of wit by drunken∣nesse, of strength by incontinencie, of health by intemperancie, of estate by prodigality, of credit and reputation by lewdnesse and dishonestie: besides the guilt of sinne, and losse by it, there is great folly in it, which vexeth the mind, and discontenteth the spirit of a man: his thoughts perpetually ac∣cusing him in this manner: This thou mightest have done, and here thou befooledst thy selfe, and thou hast brought trouble and shame upon thee: thou mayst thanke thy selfe for all the mischiefes that have befalne thee. Yea, but ye may object, Are sinne and sorrow such individuall compani∣ons? is there no sorrow but for sinne, and the effects of it? no sinne with∣out sorrow? What say you then to them that have their conscience1 Tim. 4.2. seared as with an hot iron? they surely feele no paine. What sense have they of the guilt of sinne, of Gods wrath, who are cast into a reprobate sense? I would the case were as rare as the answer unto it is easie and expedite. Admit a seared conscience feeleth no paine, was not the searing of it thinke you a paine? The heart that is like the anvile, and now hardened for the purpose, felt many a blow, and endured many fearfull stroaks before it came to be so. Although Mithridates in the end felt little hurt or pain by drinking poyson: yet before he brought his body to that temper, he never tooke any draught of poyson, but it was both painfull and perillous to him. A man must needs have many conflicts within him, many terrours and unsufferable troubles of minde, before he be utterly deprived of all sense by the frequencie and ve∣hemencie of his torments: and though those that are cast into a reprobate sense never after come to repentance, yet God oftentimes restoreth them to their sense of sorrow, and sight of the uglinesse of their sinne, and hor∣rour of their punishment, that even in this life they might tast of eternall death. As he did to Nero, when in a fit of desperation he cryed out, Have I no friend nor enemy to rid me out of my paine? And Julian the Apostata, who tare his bowels, and flung them into the aire, saying, Vicisti Galilee. BrutusPlutar. in vit. Brut. Iterum me Philippis videbis. his malus genius, the ghost that haunted him at Rome, though for the present it left him, yet it met with him againe at Philippi a little before his death. So those terrours and consternations of minde which possessed the wicked before their consciences were seared, though for many yeares they leave them, yet a little before, or at the time of their death they returne
againe in more violent manner, and so they passe from death to death, from sorrow to sorrow: nay, I may say truly, from hell to hell. But why do I stand so long upon this sorrow, which may be without repentance? because repentance cannot be without it? Compunction doth not alwaies end in godly sorrow, but godly ever begins in it. This com∣punction of pricking the heart deepe, is like the digging the earth to set the seeds of faith and repentance, and all the slippes of the flowers of Paradise: or the needles making a hole in the cloth or stuffe; the needle fils not up the bracke or rent, but the threed or silke, but onely it maketh entrance for them. So the pricking the heart with the needle ofCalv. in Act. Hoc poeniten∣tiae initium est, imo ad pieta∣tem ingressus, tristitiam ex peccatis nostris concipere, ac malorum no∣strorum sensu vulnerari: quā∣diù enim secu∣ri sunt homi∣nes, fieri non potest ut seriò animum at∣tendant ad do¦ctrinam; sed compunctioni accedere debet promptitudo ad parendum. Compuncti fu∣erunt Cain & Judas, sed ob∣stitit despera∣tio, quo minùs se Deo subjice∣rent; nam mens horrore occu∣pata, nihil ali∣ud quam fuge∣re Deum po∣test. compunction maketh way for the graces of faith and true repentance, which make up the rent and mend our lives. Beloved, if ye are pricked in heart for your sinnes, I cannot say it is well with you; but if ye have never beene pricked for them, I must say it is very ill with you. The Philosophers distinguish of a double heate, 1 Inward and naturall, which preserveth life. 2 Outward or ambient, which disposeth mist bodies to putre∣faction by drawing the other heatMercenar. l. de Putred. cont. Erast. Putredo est eductio ca∣loris naturalis à calore ambi∣ente. out of them. In like manner there is a double sorrow for sinne. 1 A sorrow arising from an inward cause, the consideration of the goodnesse of God, and the malignancie of sinne: the equity of the law, the iniquity of our transgressions: and this is a seed of, or degree unto repentance unto life. 2 A sorrow for sinne arising from an outward cause, the expectation of dreadfull punishments for sinne, both in this life, and the life to come, both temporall and eternall: and this, if it be not asswaged with some hope disposeth a sinner to desperation, as wee see in Cain, Esau, and Judas, whose sorrowes were not any way medici∣nall, but penall. No meanes to prevent, but rather to assure hellish torments, being a kind of earnest of them. Cain was pricked in heart for the murther of his brother Abel, in such sort that hee filled the aire wheresoever he fled with this lamentable cry, MyGen. 4.13. punishment is greater than I can beare. Esau would have redeemed his birthright with a large cup ofHeb. 12.17. teares, which he sold for a small messe of pottage: but his teares were spilt upon the ground, not put into the Lords bottle. Judas had sorrow enough, if that would have helped him; for to stifle his hearts griefe hee strangled himselfe: and no doubt he long swelled with paine before he burst asunderAct. 4.18. in the midst, and his bowels gushed out. Wherefore as the Apostle Saint Paul in another case exhorteth the Thessalonians, so let mee exhort you, to weepe for your sins, but not1 Thes. 4.13. as those that have no hope. Sorrow for your sinfull joyes, humble your selves for your pride, fast for your luxurie, watch for your drowsinesse, howle and crie for your crying sinnes; yet not as those that are without hope. For if the Jewes here, who spilt the blood of the Sonne of God, were quickned by it, how much more shall they that wash Christs wounds and their owne with their teares, find in his bloud the balme of Gi∣lead to cure their pricked hearts, and wounded consciences? But then, as the Jewes here, they must bee solicitous after the meanes.
They must enquire of the Apostles or their successours, Quid faciemus? What shall wee doe? if not to undoe what wee have done, yet to make some part of amends, so much as wee can, and which through Gods goodnesse shall so be taken of us, that our sinnes shall not be imputed to us. And they said, What shall wee doe? Saint Chrysostome well observeth, that they aske not, How shall we bee saved? but, What shall wee doe? It is presumptuous folly to enquire of, or hope for the end if wee neglect the meanes. If a man might goe to heaven with a sigh, many a Balaam would be found there, for hee fetched a deepe sigh, saying, Let mee die the death of the righteous. If crying, The Temple of the Lord, or saying, Lord, Lord, al∣most at every word, would without any more adoe make a man free of the heavenly Jerusalem, all the Pharisees among the Jewes, and hypo∣crites among Christians should bee denisons there. But Christ himselfe assureth us to the contrary, not every one that saith Lord, Lord,Mat. 7.21. shall en∣ter into the Kingdome of Heaven, but hee that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven. Doing and life, working and salvation, running and obtaining, winning and wearing, overcomming and reigning, in holy Scripture follow one the other. Wherefore the young man puts the que∣stion to our Saviour, WhatMark. 10.17. thing shall I doe that I may attaine evelasting life? and the people likewise, and the Publicans, and the Souldiers toLuk 3.10.12.14. S. John, and the keepers of the prison toAct. 16.30. Saint Paul, and the Jewes in my text to Saint Peter, and the rest of the Apostles, What shall wee doe? not, What shall wee say? or, What shall wee beleeve? but, What shall wee doe? This is the tenour of the Law, Doe this and thou shalt live. Whosoever doth these things shall never fall. And the Gospel also carryeth the same tune full:Mat. 7.24. If ye know these things happie are yee of yee doe them. Hee that heareth and doeth buildeth upon a rocke. Not the hearers, but the doers of theJames 1.22. Ezek. 1.8. Law shall bee justified. Why are the Cherubims described with the hands of a man under their wings, but to teach us that none shall see God, who under the wings of faith and hope (whereby they fle to heaven) have not the hand of charity to doe good workes? As Darius used the Macedonian souldiers, whom hee tooke prisoners; so the divell doth those over whom hee hath any power: hee cutts off their hands that they may be able to do no service. The heathen Philo∣sopher observed, that of three of the best things in the world, through the wickednesse of men, three of the worst things proceeded and grew: 1 Of vertue, envie. 2 Of truth, hatred. 3 Of familiarity, contempt. Wee Christians may adde a fourth, viz. of the doctrine of free justifi∣cation carnall liberty. The catholike doctrine of justification by faith a∣lone is the true Nectar of the soule, so called , because it keepeth from death: yet this sweetest Wine in the Spouses Flagons proves no better than Vinegar, or rather poyson in their stomackes, who turne grace into wantonnesse, and liberty into licence. —fit Nectar acetum, Et vaticam perfida vappa cadi.
But let no man adulterate the truth nor impose upon Christs mer∣cy what it will not beare; nor endeavour to sever faith from good workes, lest hee sever his soule from life. For though faith justifie our workes before God; yet our workes justifie our faith before men: though the just shallHabac. 2.4. Rom. 1.17. live by his faith, yet this his faith must live byJames 2.20. charity: as never man any dyed with a living faith, so never any man lived by a dead faith. I grant, when we have all done wee may, nay wee must say,Luk. 17.10. Wee are unprofitable servants: yet while we have timeGal. 6.10. we must doe good unto all, especially to those of the houshold of faith. None may trust in their owne righteousnesse; but on the contrary, all ought to pray that they may be found in Christ,Phil. 3.9. not having their owne righteousnesse: yet their righteousnesse must exceed theMat. 5.20. righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees, or else they shall never enter into the kingdome of heaven. It is evi∣dent unto all, except they be blinde, that the eye alone seeth in the body, yet the eye which seeth, is not alone in the body without the other senses: the forefinger alone pointeth, yet that finger is not alone on the hand: the hammer alone striketh the bell, yet the hammer which striketh is not alone in the clocke: the heate alone in the fire burneth, and not the light, yet that heate is not alone without light: the helme alone guideth the ship, and not the tackling, yet the helme is not alone, nor without the tackling: in a compound electuarie Rubarb alone purgeth choler, yet the Rubarb is not alone there without other ingredients. Thus wee are to conceive, that though faith alone doth justifie, yet that faith which justifieth is not alone, but joyned with charity and good workes. Many please themselves with a resem∣blance of Castor and Pollux, two lights appearing on shippes, sometimes severally, sometimes joyntly. If either appeareth by it selfe, it presageth a storme; if both together, a suddaine calme: yet (with their good leave be it spoken) this their simile is dissimile. For those lights may be severed & actu∣ally are often, but justifying faith cannot be severed from charity, nor cha∣rity from it. Thus farre onely it holdeth, that unlesse we have a sense and feeling of both in our soules, we may well feare a storme. S. Bernards di∣stinction of via regni, and causa regnandi, cleareth the truth in this point: Though good workes are not the cause why God crowneth us, yet we must take them in our way to heaven, or else we shall never come there. It is as impious to deny the necessity, as to maintaine the merit of good workes. —sed Cynthius aurem Vellit. The time calleth mee off: and therefore that it may not exclude mee, I will conclude with it. In this holy time of Lent three duties are required, Prayer, Fasting, and Almes: prayer is the bird of Paradise; fasting and almes are her two wings, the lighter is fasting, but the stronger is almes; use both to carry your prayers to heaven, that you may bring from thence a blessing upon you, through the merits and intercession of Jesus Christ. Cui, &c.
THE LAST OFFER OF PEACE. A Sermon preached at a publike Fast. THE LXX. SERMON. LUK 19.41, 42. 41. And when he was come neere, he beheld the City, and wept over it, 42. Saying, If thou hadst knowne, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace: but now they are hid from thine eyes. WHen the Romans fought a pitched field, after the rankes of their prime Leaders and chiefe Souldiers (which they called Principes) had charged valiantly, if the enemy still kept his ground, the Triarii (containing the whole shock of the army) put on, and upon their prowesse and valour depended the fortune of the day and chance (if I may so speake) of the bloudy die of war. Whereupon it grew to be a proverb,Eras. chil. Res rediit ad Triarios, it now stands upon the Triarii: as if you would say, it is now put to the last plunge. And is it not so now, my Christian brethren? We have taken to us the proper weapons of Christi∣ans, fasting, prayers, and teares, to fight against the fearfull combinations of powerfull & vigilant enemies. The rank of our Principes, the King himself, the Princes, Nobles, and Peeres have already watered this field with their teares, and put on with all their force of zealous praiers: how far they have prevailed, God only knowes. Jam ad Triarios res rediit, now the whole shock of the army, and the maine battell is to advance, and upon the sinceri∣tie of the humiliation, and fervency of devotion, and strength of our united praiers & sighes this day, dependeth much the safety and life of our State, and in it of our Church, and in it of our true and incorrupt Religion.
Let no man goe about with Mercuries inchanted rod to close the eyes of our Argus's; let no man sow pillowes under the elbowes of our true Patriots, to make them sleep in security, lest destruction steale upon us at unawares. It is certaine our enemies sleep not, and it is most certaine that our crying sinnes have awaked Gods justice: it standeth us therefore upon to watch and pray. Judgement is already begun at the house of God, the Angel hath poured out his viall of red wine upon the Churches of Bohemia, and their fields are thicke sowne with the blood of Martyrs: the same Angel hath emptied another viall upon the Churches in the Palatinate, and the sweet Rhenish grape yeelds in a manner now no liquor but blood: a third viall runneth out at this houre upon the reformed Churches in France, and our sinnes as it were holloe to him to stretch his hand over the narrow sea, and cast the dregges of it on us, who have beene long settled upon our lees: and undoubtedly this will bee our potion to drinke, if wee stretch not our hands to heaven, that God may command his Angel to stay his hand. If hee have already turned his viall, and wee see drops of bloud hanging in the ayre; yet the strong wind of our prayers may blow them away and dispell them, in such sort that they shall not fall upon us: a gale of our sighes may cleare the skie. Moses praiers manicled the hands of Almighty God, and shall not the united devotions of this whole Land either stay or turne his Angels hand? Away with all confidence in the arme of flesh, away with all hope in man, away with all cloakes of sinne, and vizzards of hypocrisie, there is no dissembling with God, no fighting against him. Albeit our land bee com∣passed with the sea as with a moat, and environed with ships furnished with ordnance, as with brazen and iron walls: though the most puissant Princes on earth should send us innumerable troupes to succour and aide us, yet we have no fence: for  we lye open to heaven, wee are naked to the ar∣rowes of the Almighty, and no carnall weapons for succours can stand us in any stead; onely the helmet of salvation, and the buckler of faith, and the powder of a contrite heart, and the shot of pious ejaculations may doe us some good. It is our pride (Beloved) that hath throwne us downe, and it is hu∣mility which must raise us: our divisions have weakened us, and it is union that can strengthen us: our luxury hath imbezelled us, and now nothing but fasting and abstinence can recover us: our sinnes have made a breach, and nothing but repentance can make it up: our profane oathes, our sinfull plea∣sures, our carnall security and sensuality hath driven away the Spirit of grace and comfort from us, and nothing can wooe him to returne backe a∣gaine but our vowes of amendment, unfeigned teares and sorrowfull sighes. Let us therefore ply sighes andCyp. ep. 1. Incumbamus igitur gemiti∣bus assiduis, & deprecationi∣bus crebris: haec enim sunt arma coelestia, quae stare & perseverare for∣titer faciunt; haec sunt muni∣menta spiritua∣lia & tela divina, quae protegunt nos. Et serm. de laps. Oportet transigere vigiliis noctes, tempus omne lachrymosis lamentationibus occupare stratos solo adhaerere cineri, in cilicio volutari & sordibus. prayers: for these are the spirituall weapons we alone can trust to, through the intercession of Christs bloud, which spea∣keth better things for us than the bloud of Abel. These weapons our Lord himselfe made tryall of in my Text, and sanctified them to our use, viz. pas∣sionate teares, and compassionate prayers. When hee drew neere to Jerusalem, and fore-saw in spirit that shee drew neere to her ruine, his eyes melted with teares (he beheld the City, and wept) and his heart breaketh out into sighes (Oh that thou knewest.) Teares trickle
not down in order, neither are sighes fetched by method. Expect not there∣fore from mee any accurate division, or methodicall handling of this pas∣sionate Text: only in the first place fasten the eye of your observation upon the eyes of our Saviour, and you shall discerne in them, 1. Beames of love, He beheld. 2. Teares of compassion, He wept over it. In the next place bow the eares of your religious attention towards his mouth, and ye shall heare from him, 1. Sighes of desire, Oh (or if) that thou knewest. 2. Plaints of sorrow, But now they are hid from thine eyes. I have pitched (as you see) upon aHom. Il. . moist plat, or fenny ground; wherein that your devotion may walke more steadily, I have laid out for you five knolls or steps to rest upon and pawse. 1. Venit, He came. 2. Vidit, He beheld. 3. Flevit, He wept. 4. Ingemuit, He sighed. 5. Oravit, He prayed. 1. Venit or appropinquavit, he drew neere. The end of our Saviours life here was the sacrifice of his death: he was borne that he might die for us, and by one oblation of himselfe on the crosse, satisfie for the sinnes of the whole world. Now all sacrifices by the Law were to be offered at Jerusa∣lem; to Jerusalem therefore hee comes up to finish the worke of our re∣demption: and he maketh the more haste, because Easter was neere at hand, when he was to eate the Paschall Lambe with his Disciples, and to be eaten of them in the mysterious rite of the Sacrament: to kill the passover in the type, but to be killed himselfe in the truth. Oh, how farre hath our Savi∣our left us behind him in his love? He came with a swift foot to us, we re∣turne with a slow foot to him: he made more haste to give himselfe, than we make to receive him. After hee received the commandement from his Father to lay downe his life for his sheep, he rode more cheerfully into Jeru∣salem, and was led more willingly to the altar of the crosse, where hee lost his life, than we repaire to his holy table, there to be partakers of the bread of eternall life. He came neere to the City, that he might view it: he viewed it, that hee might weep over it: hee wept over it, that hee might testifie a threefold truth, 1. Naturae, of his Nature, 2. Amoris, of his Love, 3. Doctrinae. of his Doctrine or prophesie. 1. Veritatem naturae, the truth of his humane nature. He must needs be a true man, who out of compassion sheds teares, , sic fatur la∣chrymans. Cold stone or metall relenteth not, a phantasme grieves not, a pi∣cture weepeth not: these teares then of our Saviour may serve as haile-shot to wound all such Heretickes as imagined that Christ had but an imagina∣ry body. 2. Veritatem amoris, the truth of his love. It is true love which resol∣veth it selfe into teares upon the sight or apprehension of anothers losse, griefe, or danger. When Jesus wept at the grave of Lazarus, the Jewes
said, Behold how heJoh. 11.36. loved him: and when the Disciples and whole multitude saw Christ weepe as soone as he came in sight of Jerusalem, they could not but say within themselves, Behold how he loveth this city. 3. Veritatem prophetiae, the truth of his prophecie concerning the de∣struction of Jerusalem, and all the calamities that shortly after befell the Jewish nation: they must needs be true evils and judgements certainly to come upon the city, which the Sonne of God foretelleth with wet eyes. Quum appropinquavit, , when he came neere. If Christ in his humane body could have beene present in many places at once, as the Trent Fathers teach, and ourBell. lib. 3. de sacr. Euch. c. 3. & 4. Romanists set their faith upon the tenters to beleeve; he then might have spared many a wearisome journey, he needed not to have travelled as he did from country to country, and city to city: all the progresses which he made through Judea, and Galile, and Samaria, and the coasts of Tyrus and Sidon, might have beene saved. For without stirring his foote, by this doctrine, he might have presented himselfe at the same time in Nazareth, and Bethlehem, and Corazin, Bethsaida, and Caper∣naum, and Nain, and Jerusalem: as, if we may beleeveAelian. de Var. hist. lib. 4. Pythagoras eo∣dem die & ho∣râ visus est in Metapentio, & Crotona, & in Olympo femur aureum osten∣dit. Aelian, Pythagoras at the same time was seene in divers cities, and there shewed his golden thigh (a fit miracle for aurea legenda, the golden legend) sed quia non legimus non cre∣dimus, but because we find no such thing in Scripture we beleeve it not. We are so farre from finding it there that we find the direct contrary:Math. 28.6. He is not here, for he is risen. If there be any force at all in this reason of the Angel, the humane body of Christ cannot be in more places at once: for could it be in more places at once, it might have beene in the grave and risen out of it at the same time, which the Angels for supposeth to be impossible. Hector adest, secúmque deos in praelia ducit. In this battell against the Trent faith we have men and Angels on our side; for as the Angel argueth here from the impossibility of the existence of Christs body in more places at once, so do the ancient fathers.Lib. 4. contr. Eutic. Christi corpus quando in terra fuit, non erat utique in coelo: & nunc quia est in coelo, non est utique in terra. Vigilius, Christs body, when it was upon earth, was not at the same time in heaven: and now because  is in heaven, it is not therefore upon earth: and SaintAug. l. 20. cont. Faust. Manic. c. 11. Secun∣dum praesenti∣am spiritualē? nullo modo pati illa possit secundum prae∣sentiam cor∣poralem? si∣mul in sole, & luna, & cruce esse non possit. Austine, When ye Manichees teach that Christ was at the same time in the Sun and in the Moone, & upon the Crosse, what meane ye by presence? his divine & spirituall? that is nothing to your purpose; for according to that hee could not suffer. Do you mean corporall? according to that he could not be together in more places, and consequently not (as ye suppose) in the sunne, and in the moone, and upon the crosse at once. As the Poets faigne of Hercules, that in his cradle, with one graspe of his hand hee killed two serpents: so by the handling of this one circumstance (if the time, and this present occasion would permit mee) I might kill two monsters of heresies, the former of tran∣substantiation, which you see lieth halfe dead before you; the latter of con∣substantiation: the former holdeth a multi-presence, and the latter an omni∣presence, or ubiquity of Christs body. The word appropinquavit, he came neere, reacheth a blow home to both these. For comming neere a place is a locall motion. Now every locall motion must have a terminus à quo, and a terminus ad quem; a place or point to bee left, and another to be got: which cannot be verified in a body, which in the same time is in utroque termino, in the terme from which, and the tearme to which it is to move:
much lesse can an infinite or omnipresent body move locally: because such a body, according to their supposition, filleth all places, and consequently cannot goe from one to another: i nnot lose any place it had, or acquire any it had not. This comming heere then of our Saviour to Jerusalem, proveth that the Lutherans and all ubiquitaries are as farre out of the way (in this point) as Papists: they that hold this errour, must blot out all Christs gests recorded by the Evangelists, and reverse all his progresses from Judea to Galile, and from Galile to Judea: from Jerusalem to Nazareth, and from Nazareth to Jerusalem: from land to sea, and from sea to land. Moreover, to entitle a creature to ubiquity is to deifie it, and to attribute this incommunicable property of the deitie to the humane nature of Christ, is to confound his two natures. Thus heresies unnaturally engender, the later with the former, and Lutheranisme begets Eutychianisme: at which monstrous error, though the Romanists are startled; yet the heresie of tran∣substantiation which they foster at this day is of the same cast. Admit once that Christs body may be at the same time in heaven at the right hand of his Father, & on the Altar in the right hand of the Priest: why may it not be in milions of places? if it may be wheresoever masses are said, why may it not also by divine power be where they are not said? why not then every where? if it may stand with the unity of an individuall body to be in two di∣stinct and distant places at once, it may as well be in two hundred places; and if in two hundred, in two thousand; and if in two thousand, every where. The nature of an individuall body, which is to be indivisum in se, & divisum â caeteris omnibus, is as well destroyed by putting it in two places at once, as in two millions. Wherefore, as wood cleavers drive out one wedge by another, and conjurers cast out one spirit by another as bad; and as Plato tooke downe Diogenes, trampling upon his rich carpet,Eras. Apoph. and saying, I tread Platoes pride under my feete: Calcas fastum, sed alio fastu; thou treadest upon my pride (saith he) but out of as great or greater pride: so our adversaries the Papists may be justly taxed for exterminating one er∣rour, the errour of consubstantiation, by bringing in another as bad, the errour of transubstantiation, which putteth accidents without subjects, quantity without dimensions, bodies without place, and what not?Sueton in Ca∣lig. Utinam po∣pulus Roma∣nus haberet u∣nicam cervi∣cem. Cali∣gula wished that all his enemies had but one necke, that hee might cut them all off at one blow: the three heresies now mentioned have all but one necke, I will therefore smite off all their heads at once with the sword of the Spirit. Christ was like unto us in all things, sinne onely excepted: if so, then was hee circumscribed with quantity, and confined to one place at once: then not in many places, as the Papists teach; and much lesse in all places, as the Eutychians and Lutherans beare us in hand he is. But to leave the confutation of these heresies, and draw neere unto our present occasion. Christ never came to any place but hee left behinde him some print of his Majestie, or pledge of his love: he touched no where, but he wrought some miracle, or shewed some mercy. If the presence of the Arke, which was but a type or shadow, brought a blessing to Obed Edome: how much more shall the presence of the body, & the truth himself, make the place happie wheresoever he resideth? Jesus never commeth without sal∣vation with him: and therefore when he entred into the house of Zaccheus,
he laid, Hodie huic domui salus contigit, this day salvationLuk. 19.9. is come to this house. The approach of the Sunne is the spring and joy of the yeare: even so the approach of Christ is the blooming of the trees, and opening the flowers of Paradise: it crowneth oth the Church and Common∣wealth with spirituall and temporall blessings, as it were garlands, one upon the other. Yea, but how may his approach be obtained? who can intreat him to come neare us? what load-stone can draw his love to us? I answer, Our love, our faith, our hope, our devotion. James 4.8.Draw neere unto God, and hee will draw neere unto you. Draw neere unto him by faith, accedit qui credit, faith layeth hold on him. Draw neere un∣to him by hope, hope relieth upon him: Draw neere unto him by love, love embraceth him, andPsal. 73.28. adhereth to him: Draw neere untoEsa. 29.3. him with your lippes by prayer, with yourEccles. 5.1. eares by listening to his Word: draw neare with your whole body by presenting your selves at his table, and worthi∣ly participating the holy Sacrament. Thus if ye draw neere to him, he will draw neere to you, and comming neere to you as he did to Jerusalem, hee will fixe his eyes on you. And so I passe to the second step: 2. Vidit, he beheld it. There is comfort when the Physician commeth to visit his patient: there is hope when an expert Chirurgeon vieweth a dan∣gerous wound. David thought it enough to say, LookePsal. 25.18. upon mine affliction and miserie: and,Psal. 84.9. Looke upon the face of thine annointed: and, Lord liftPsal. 4.8. thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. God never casteth his eye upon a∣ny, but he settleth his affection upon him: and hee never settleth affecti∣on upon any without an intention of blessing them. As Christ cured mens bodies with a word, so their soules with a looke. Hee looked upon Peter, and presently he repented: he looked upon Zaccheus, and presently he was justified: hee looked upon Saint Matthew, and presently hee was called: Why then was Jerusalem no better for this gracious aspect? because she shut her eyes against the true light. When Christ looked to her, she turned away from him: when he wept for her, she laught at him: when hee sought to save her, shee plotted his death and destruction. Yet were not the beams of Christs eye cast in vaine upon this City; for the spirituall Jerusalem, as SaintOrig. in hunc locum. Origen telleth us, that is, the faithfull in Jerusalem were the better for them: for they observed our Saviours eye, and kept his teares in a bottle, and laid up his words in their heart; and being fully perswaded of the truth of his prediction concerning the destruction of the City and Temple, when forty years after Titus began to lay siege to it, they left it, and fled to Pella, and thereby escaped all those miseries and troubles which our Savi∣our could not foretell with drie eyes. The Philosophers and Physicians are not yet agreed utrum visio fiat extramittendo vel intromittendo, whether in the act of seeing the eye casteth out beames upon the object, or recei∣veth species from it. The question is easily resolved here: for Christ both cast out a beame of his affection out of his eye on the City, and received also the species or image of it into his eye: at once he looked upon her with a twofold eye, 1 The eye of sense. 2 The eye of Prophesie.
To the eye of sense Jerusalem appeared most beautifull, glorious, and happy, environed with strong walls, adorned with magnificent buildings, stored with people abounding in wealth, and furnished with all sort of mu∣nition: but to the eye of prophesie shee appeared in another hiew, with her walls sacked, her houses burnt, her turrets demolished, her young men slaine, her virgins defloured, her priests sacrificed, her streets piled with carkasses, and her channels running with gore bloud. Vir. Aenead. 2—Quis talia fando Temperet à lachrymis? This most lamentable spectacle, though a farre off, drew teares from our Saviours eyes. And so I passe to the third step, which is the wettest of all: 3. Flevit super eam. He wept over it. In the water of Christs teares we may see after a sort the face both of his humane and divine nature. In that they were teares issuing from the troubled fountain of sorrow in his heart, they prove him to be a true man: but in that they represented the weeping and mourning that should ensue after his death in Jerusalem, they demon∣strate him to be true God: forTertul. apol. argumentum divinitatis veritas divinationis, the certainty of divination is an argument of divinity. Neither were these teares onely indices naturae, evidences of his nature, but pledges of his love, and (asOrig. in Mat. Omnes beti∣tudines quas in Evangelio lo∣cutus est, suo firmavit ex∣emplo. Origen noteth) instances of his doctrine touching the blessednesse of mourners. Christ exemplified every point of his doctrine in himselfe: he taught that the poore in spirit are blessed, and none so humble in heart as hee: hee taught that peace-makers were blessed, & who so great a peace-maker as he, who is our peace, and reconciled heaven and earth? hee taught, blessed are they that suffer for righteousnesse sake, and none ever suffered so much as he: he taught, blessed are they that mourne, and he wept himselfe, sanctifying thereby tears, and assuring all godly mourners here, of comforts hereafter.Gor. in Luc. c. 19. Christus quater flevit, 1. in nativitate, Sap. 7. Primam vocem nobis similem emi∣sit plorans. 2. In Laza∣ri suscitatio∣ne, Joh. 11. La∣crymatus est Je∣sus. 3. in hac so∣lenni processi∣one, flevit su∣per eam. 4. in passione, Heb. 5. Haec sunt quatuor flumi∣na quae de Pa∣radiso prodie∣runt, Gen. 2. ad totius mundi, 1. ablutionem. 2. refrigeratio∣nem. 3. foecun∣dationem. 4. potationem. Gorrhan observed that Christ shed teares foure times, first at his birth, next in the raising of Lazarus, a third time in his surveigh of Jerusalem, and a fourth time on the crosse: and these foure, saith he, are spiritually the foure rivers of Paradise, which serve 1. to purge: 2. to coole and refresh: 3. to water and make fruitfull: 4. to quench the thirst of the world of beleevers. Not∣withstanding I find in the Gospel but two leaves onely wet with our Savi∣ours teares, Joh. 11. and here. It is likely he cried at his birth after the man∣ner of other children; and it is certaine that hee offered up prayers upon the crosse with strong cries: yet we reade not of any teares shed by him but here on Mount Olivet, and at Lazarus his grave, and both teares were teares of compassion, and both also funerall teares. There he wept for the death of Lazarus, and here for the finall period, and, if I may so speake, funerals of Jerusalem, to be solemnized with desolation, and exceeding great mourning, like that of Hadradrimmon in the valley of Megiddo, within a few yeeres af∣ter his passion. It was the manner of the Prophets, when they fore-told the calamities that were to fall upon any people or nation, to expresse them as well by signes as by words, to make a deeper impression in their hearers. Ahiah1 Kings 11.30. cut Jeroboams cloake, Jeremy breaketh hisJer. 19.10. bottle, EzekielEzek. 5.1. shaveth his beard, AgabusAct. 21.11. bindeth himselfe. In like manner, Christ prophesying the finall overthrow of the City and Temple, repre∣senteth the great sorrow, mourning and lamentation of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem by his owne teares. Theodoret yeeldeth another reason: Alii flent ex passione, Christus ex compassione: Others weep (saith he) out of pas∣sion, Christ out of compassion: Ut ostenderet qualia haberet erga ingrates vi∣scera; to shew what bowels hee had toward the ungratefull though they least deserve teares, who have no sense at all of their owne misery, yet they most of all need them. It grieveth mee (saith S.Cypr. de laps. Plango quia te non plangis. Cyprian) that thou grievest not for thy selfe: mine eyes are wet because thine are alwaies dry: I have lit∣tle comfort, because there is little or no hope of grace in thee. Ea fletus ma∣joris causa est, cùm rideant qui flere debeant; wee have the greater cause to mourne, when they laugh who ought to weep. Jerusalem was now in a fit of frenzy, shee laughed, and feasted, and revelled, even now when shee was neere utter ruine and confusion: and this more opened the salt springs in our Saviours eyes; hee shed teares the more abundantly by reason of the carnall security, obstinacy, and senslesse stupidity of the Jewes his Countri∣men, and especially the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who killed the Prophets, and stoned them who were sent unto them to fore-warne them of Gods feare∣full judgements hanging over their heads. I told you before that this was a wet step, and many here have slipt: For this objection offereth it self to every mans conceit: Was not Christ God, and consequently omnipotent? could not he have prevented their finall o∣verthrow? could not hee have given those Jewes beleeving and relenting hearts? could he not have converted them all miraculously by a vision from heaven, as hee did St. Paul, who before that powerfull change wrought in him, was as much enraged against the professours of the Gospel as any of these? nay more? Did not Christ foresee and decree the destruction of Jerusa∣lem? how then doth he bemoane it with teares?Calv. harm. in evang. Sicut è coelo descendit Christus car∣ne humanâ in∣dutus, ut di∣vinae salutis te∣stis esset, & minister, vere humanos in∣duit affectus; quatenus sus∣ceptae functio∣ni intererat, quatenus datus erat huic po∣pulo minister in salutem, pro officii sui ra∣tione illius ex∣itium deplora∣vit. Deus erat fateor, sed quoties opor∣tuit doctoris officio fungi, quievit, ac se quodammodo abscondidit deitas. Calvin reacheth us a hand to helpe us off of this wet knoll: As (saith he) Christ descended from heaven clad with humane flesh, that he might bee a witnesse and minister of divine sal∣vation, he truly put upon him also humane affections, so far as it was requisite for the discharge of his function: therefore as being sent as a minister for the salvation of that people, in the faithfull execution of his office hee forewarned them of their danger, and bewailed their overthrow, which could not but en∣sue upon their obstinacy and impenitency. Hee was God I acknowledge, and most certainly fore-saw what would befall the City, according to his eternall decree; but whilest hee performed the office of a teacher, the deity rested as it were, and hid it selfe. That yee may take faster hold upon this stay, which this learned Interpreter reacheth unto you, ye are to consider Christ three manner of waies: 1. As God, 2. As man, 3. As Mediatour betweene God and man. As God he most justly sentenced that bloody City to utter ruine and de∣solation; as man he could not but bee touched with griefe and sorrow for those heavie judgements which hung over the city and people, they taking no course at all to prevent or avert them; as Mediatour betwixt God and man, he might and ought ex officio, both bewaile what hee fore-told, and fore-tell what hee now bewailed: and that most seriously. For pro quibus
nunc lachrymas, postea effudit sanguinem; for hee shed his bloud for those for whom he now shed teares: and it was their owne fault, that this death was not effectuall to them for their redemption and salvation. An all-suffici∣ent remedy was tendered unto them, but they would none of it; and even this also, as it aggravated their sinne, and consequently their punishment, so it increased their spirituall Physicians griefe, and drew more teares from his eyes: Utinam, Domine, ut verbum caro factum est, sic cor meum carneum fiat; Oh that as the word was made flesh, so my heart were made fleshly and tender, to receive a deep impression of my brethrens griefe. Such a heart was Jeremies, which evaporated into these sighes,Jer. 9.1. Oh that my head were wa∣ters, and mine eyes fountaines of teares, that I might weep day and night for the slaine of the daughter of my people. Such was Saint Pauls,2 Cor 11.29. Besides those things that are without, that which commeth upon mee daily, the care of all the Churches: who is weake, and I am not weake? who is offended, and I burne not? Of the same temper was Saint Cyprian, ICypr. ep. 16. Compatior & condoleo fra∣tribus nostris, qui lapsi & pr∣secutionis infe∣statione pro∣strati, & par∣tem nostro∣rum viscerum secum trahen∣tes acrem do∣lorem suis vul∣neribus intu∣lerunt. Et l. de laps. Cum plangen∣tibus plango, cum deflenti∣bus dfleo, cum prostratis fatribus me quoque pro∣stravit affectus. sympathize and condole with you for those of our brethren, whom the cruelty of persecution hath over∣throwne, and laid upon their backs: the wounds which they have received no lesse paine mee, than if part of my bowells had been plucked out of my body. And againe, I mourne with them that mourne, and weep with them that weep, and am cast downe with them that are fallen. This sympathy is a more no∣ble worke of mercy and charity towards our afflicted brethren, than boun∣ty it selfe: he that spendeth his affection upon his brother in his distresse, doth more than hee that reacheth unto him an almes: for the one giveth somewhat out of his purse, the other out of his bowells: on the contrary, want of naturall affection is ranked with the worst of all vices,Rom. 1 31. , being filled with all unrighteousnesse, wic∣kednesse, covetousnesse, maliciousnesse, full of envie, murder, debate, back-bi∣ters, haters of God, disobedient to parents, covenant breakers, without natu∣rall affection, implacable, unmercifull. Doubtlesse they are monsters in na∣ture that want bowells: nothing more provoked God, inSalvian de Dei gubern. l. 6. Confundeba∣tur vox mori∣entium, & vox bacchntim, & vix discerni poterat plebis ejulatus qui fiebat in bello, & sonus popu∣li qui clamabat in circo. Salvianus his judgement, to double his stroaks upon the French, when the Goths came in upon them, than that they had no sense or feeling of their brethrens calami∣ties. The voice of the dying could hardly be distinguished from the clamours of those that were drunk; at the same time when the people without the City cried out for feare of the enemy, the people within the City shouted at their sports. It is not safe for any to feast, when God calleth to fast; to sing, when God calleth to sigh; to brave it in gorgeous apparrell, when God calleth to sack∣cloth. Whose heart quaketh not at that thunder-clap in the Prophet Esay?Esay 22.12, 13, 14. And in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping, and mourning, and to baldnesse, and to girding with sackcloth. And behold joy and gladnes, slay∣ing oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine. And it was revea∣led in my eares by the Lord of hosts; surely this iniquity shall not bee purged from you till you die. The sinne wherewith God charged the old world be∣fore it was over-flowne with a deluge of water, and Christ in the Gospel chargeth the new, which shall be over-flowne with a deluge of fire, is the same wherewith hee here chargeth the Jewes, that they knew not, that is, tooke not notice of the time of their visitation:Luk 17.26, 27, 28, 29, 30. As it was in the dayes of Noah: so shall it be also in the daies of the Son of man. They did eate, they
dranke, they married wives, they were given in marriage, ntill the day that Noah entred into the Arke, and the floud came and destroyed them all. Like∣wise also as it was in the daies of Lot, they did eate, they dranke, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodome, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all: E∣ven so shall it be in the day when the Sonne of man shall be revealed. The meaning is, they went on in the ordinary tract of their businesse, as if there had been no judgement toward, as also did the inhabitants of Jerusalem at this time, whom when Jesus saw so neere the brink of destruction, and yet so carelesse, he wept; , when he considered what he was to suffer for that City, and what that City afterwards was to suffer because of him, his griefe ran over the naturall bankes his eies. The same organ is ordained for seeing and weeping, to teach us, that weeping should not be without seeing, nor sorrowing without understan∣ding. The cause why we weep not for the desolation of our Jerusalem neere at hand (if this our present fasting and repenting in dust and ashes remove it not) is, because wee see not the evills that hang over our heads: wee see them not, because we put them farre from us, or hide them from our eies. The infant, while it lieth in the darke prison of the mothers wombe, never quatcheth nor weepeth; but as soone as ever it commeth out of the womb into the light, it knits the browes, and wrings the eyes, and cries, & taketh on: even so the childe of God, whilest he is yet kept in the darke of igno∣rance, in his unregenerate estate, never crieth to his Father, nor weepeth for his sinne; but as soone as the light of grace shineth upon him, hee be∣waileth his grievous misery, and never thinketh that he hath filled his cup of teares full enough. The spouts will not runne currently, if we pump not deep. If then wee would have the spouts which nature hath placed in our heads run aboundantly with teares of repentance, we must pump deep, we must dive deep into the springs of godly sorrow, which are the considera∣tion of our owne sinnes, and the afflictions of Gods people. Were Jesus now upon earth in his mortall body, and should behold this Kingdome as he did the City of Jerusalem, and take a survay of all the evills we doe, and are like to suffer, could he (thinke you) refraine from teares? would he not second his teares with groanes? And so I passe to the fourth step: 4. Ingemuit, he sighed, saying, If thou knewest, or, Oh that thou hadst knowne. The Greekes in their Proverbe give it for a character of a good man, that he is much subject to sighing, and free of his teares: Eras. chil.. I am sure the best man that ever was, as hee wept more than once, so hee sighed often. When he opened the eares of the deafe and dumbe, and when the Pharisees seeking of him a signe tempted him, heMar. 7.34. Looking up to heaven, he sigh∣ed, and saith unto him, Effa∣ta, be thou opened. Mar. 8.12. sighed deeply in his spirit: and when he raisedJohn 11.38. Jesus therefore groaning in spi∣rit commeth to the grave. Lazarus stinking in the grave; and againe in my Text. And this he doth not as God (for immunity from passion is a pre∣rogative of the divine nature) but, as Calvin teacheth, quia minister huic po∣pulo in salutem datus, as a minister of salvation to this people. Here then I cannot but reflect upon mine owne calling, and preach to Preachers and all Ministers of the Gospel, that by the example of our Lord and Master, the
high Priest and Bishop of our soules, we take chiefly and in a speciall man¦ner to heart the calamities of Gods people, and ruine of his Church. The eyes of our Saviour here, as likewise ofEsay 22.4. I will weep bit∣terly: labour not to comfort mee, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people. Esay,Jerem. 4.8. & 9.1. Jeremy, andEzra 10.1. Ezra, glazed with teares, are looking-glasses, wherein wee may see the duty enjoyned to us by the Prophet Joel,Joel 2.17. Let the Priests, the Ministers of God, weep between the porch and the altar. For in the spoiling of the country, and demolishing the Churches, and the houses of Prophets and Prophets children, Gods honour suffereth, whereof we ought to be most jealous: the soules of men are in no lesse danger than their bodies and estates, whereof we are to ren∣der an account; and as we are Gods mouth to the people, to declare his will to them, so we are their mouth to God, to present their supplications to him. All the measures of the Sanctuary were double to the common. As the measure of our knowledge is greater, so the measure of our giefe and sorrow in the affliction of Gods people ought to be corresponding. The same proportion holds in sorrow and joy. And therefore as in the common joy SaintCypr. ep. 1. Exprimi satis non potest quanta ista ex∣ultatio fuit. & quant laetitia cum de vobis prospera & fortia compe∣rissemus, du∣cem te illic confssionis fratibs exti∣tisse, sed & con∣fessionem du∣cis de consen∣sione fratrum creviss, &c. Et Ep. 5. In comuni gu∣dio Ecclesiae Episcopi por∣tio mjor est, Ecclesiae enim gloria Praepo∣siti gloria est. Cyprian allotteth the Bishop a greater portion; so also in the com∣mon griefe our portion must needs bee the greatest. Wee stand upon the watch-towers of Sion, and the people take notice of dangers from the fiering of our beacons: we are as the praecentores chori, to give them the tune: we are as Trumpeters in Gods army; and if the Trumpet bee cracked, or give an uncertaine sound, how shall the souldiers prepare themselves to fight the Lords battels? If we (like Epaminondas) ought to fast, that the people may feast the more securely: watch, that they may sleep with more safety: weep, that they may rejoyce more freely; how much more ought we, being the Asaphs in this sad quire, accord with you in your groanes and cries, when we are strucke with the same griefes and feares, when the enemy aimeth not so much at the Common-wealth as at the Church, and not so much at the body as at the soule of the Church, the Religion wee pro∣fesse, and our most holy faith? O ubi estis fontes lachrymarum! O where are you fountaines of tears! where are gales of such sighes! such as love and devotion, and sympathy breathes out in my Text, If thou knewest. And so I passe to the last step: 5. Oravit, he prayed, saying, O that thou knewest, or, If thou knewest. In this prayer of our Saviour, our thoughts may find themselves holy im∣ployment, in seriously considering, 1. The manner or forme of speech, which is 1. Figurative, 2. Abrupt, 3. Passionate. 2. The matter, which presenteth to our spirituall view 1. The intimation of a desire, O that, or, If. 2. The exprobration of Ignorance, Thou knewest. 3. The aggravation upon the person, Thou, even thou. 4. The designation of a time, In this thy day. The sentence riseth by degrees, and Christ in every word groweth more and more upon Jerusalem. It is sinne and shame to be ignorant, most of all for Jerusalem, and that in the day of her visitation, especially of those things that belong to her peace. If other Cities might plead ignorance, yet
not thou: if thou mightst plead ignorance at another time, yet not in this thy day: if in this thy day thou mightst plead ignorance of other things, yet not of those things that belong to thy peace. To begin with the forme and manner, which the more imperfect it is, the more perfectly it expresseth the passion, or rather compassion of the speaker. As a cracked pipe or bell giveth a harsh or uncertaine sound, so a broken heart for the most part uttereth broken speeches, interrupted with sighes. Constantine kissed the empty holes where Paphnutius eyes were plucked out; and we cannot but reverence the seeming emptinesse and va∣cuity in Scripture sentences, where the omission of something is more sig∣nificant than the supply (if the speech had been filled up) would have been. Those which have bin transported with passion, utter halfeCalv. in harm. Scimus in quibus ar∣dent vehemen∣tes affectus, non nisi dimi∣diatâ ex parte sensus suos ef∣fari. sentences, and faulter in the midst of a period, as the father in the Poet, who lost his only sonne, beginning to vent his griefe, and saying, Filius meus pollens ingenio, My sonne of rare parts, my sonne of great hope, there stops, and before he could say mortuus est, is dead, became himselfe speechlesse. Christ was here seized on by a double passion, 1. Of Commiseration, 2. Of Indignation. Commiseration out of the apprehension of the overthrow of Jerusa∣lem, the Queen of all Cities, and the Sanctuary of the whole earth. Indignation at the obstinacy, ingratitude and bloud-thirsty cruelty, and desperate madnesse of the present inhabitants, who wilfully refusing the meanes of their salvation, runne headlong to their owne perdition. I have been the briefer in handling the forme, that I might enlarge my selfe in the matter. Thou knewest. Ignorance of Gods judgements draweth them upon a state: for the Lord hath a controversie with the land (saithHos. 4.1.6. Hosea) because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land: My people perish for lack of knowledge. The Schooles rightly distinguish of a double ignorance: 1. Facti, of the fact. 2. Juris, of the Law. Ignorance of the fact in some case excuseth, but not of the law, which all are bound to take notice of: for Lex datur vigilantibus, non dormientibus; The law is given to men that are awake, and may and ought to heare it, not to men when they are asleep. The law, for the violation whereof the greatest part are condemned, is written in the tables of their hearts, to exclude all plea of ignorance: and certainly of all the errours of Popery, one of the grossest is their entitling ignorance the mother of devotion: for so farre is ignorance from being the mother of any vertue, that it is both 1. Peccatum, 2. Mater peccati, 3. Poena peccati. It is sinne, and the punishment of sinne, and the parent of sinne. First it is sinne; for God in the Law appointed aLevit. 4.2. & 5.15. sacrifice for a trespasse by ignorance: and the servant in the Gospel, which knew not his Masters will, and there∣fore did it not, shall be beaten with fewerLuke 12.48. stripes indeed than the other, who knew his Masters will, and did it not, yet with some. Secondly, it is the pa∣rent
of sinne, viz. of many errours in matter of faith, which, are sinnes: ThisPsal. 95.10. people (saith God) hath erred in their heart, because they have not knowne my waies. And Christ imputeth the grosse errour of the Pharisees concer∣ning the resurrection to their ignorance of the Scriptures:Mat. 22.29. Ye doe erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. And it is also the punishment of sinne, as we reade, Because they did not like to retaine God in theirRom. 1 21, 28. know∣ledge, God gave them over to a reprobate sense, and their foolish heart was darkened. Even this is a sin of ignorance, not to know that ignorance is a sin. I speake not only of ignorantia pravae dispositionis, of wilfull ignorance, but also of nescience, which they call simple ignorance: why else doth the Pro∣phet pray, Effunde aestum tuum in gentes quae te ignorant; Poure downe thine indignation upon thePsal. 79.6. nations that know thee not, and upon the people that call not upon thy Name? Why doth the Apostle threaten2 Thes. 1.8 flaming fire to all that know not God? I would S.De grt. & lib arbitr. c. 3. Sed & ill ig∣norantia quae non est eorum qui scire no∣lunt, sed eorum qui tantum simpliciter ne∣sciunt, nemi∣nem sic excu∣sat ut sempiter∣no igne non ardeat. Austines censure might upon good ground from Scripture be qualified, where he passeth the sentence of damnation to eter∣nall fire, even upon those who never had knowledge of the means of salvati∣on, and not only upon those who might have known them if they would. Yea, but we have all knowledge, our ignorance will not cast us, the clea∣rest beames of the Gospel have for these many yeers shined in our climate; we should be most unthankful to him that dwelleth in an unaccessible light, if we should not acknowledge as much. It is most true in these parts, as in the part of heaven over our heads, we see continually many goodly starres, yea many constellations of starres; but as about the South pole, so in divers re∣mote parts of this Kingdome there is scarce any starre to be discerned, or if any, but a blinking starre of the sixth magnitude. Yet to yeeld us a greater knowledge than other nations, I feare that this plea will rather hurt us than help us; if we could say truly we were blind, we should not have so much to answer for: butJohn 9 41. now, because we say we see, our sinne remaineth, if we so perfectly know our Masters will, and doe it so imperfectly, a few stripes will not serve our turne:De gubern. Dei lib 4 Quanto mino∣re periculo illi per Daemonia pjerant, quàm nos per Chri∣stum? Et nun∣quid tam cri∣minosa est Hunnorum impudiitia, quam nostra? nunquid tam rep chensibilis Almanni e∣brietas, quam Christini? Doe ye thinke (saith Salvianus) that the heathen so much dishonour God when they forsweare themselves by their false gods, as you when you forsweare your selves by the true? Doe you thinke a Jew, or a Pagan, or a Papist by his profane or loose life causeth the truth to be so e∣vill spoken of, as we that have the word taught among us most purely, yet live impurely, who know better, yet doe worse? As we presume of our knowledge, so did Jerusalem, which is by interpretation theRob. Steph. interpret no∣minum Heb. & Chld. Visio pacis, seu visio perfecta. vision of peace, much more; yet our Saviour upbraideth her with ignorance, saying, Thou, even thou. Our Saviour strikes twice upon the same string, he rub∣beth againe and againe upon the same sore: Thou, even thou. Thou which carriest peace in thy name, thinkest not thou of those things that belong to thy peace? Jerusalem was once the light of the world, and yet behold she is darknesse. From Moses to the daies of John Baptist, and from the daies of John Baptist till this present she was instructed by Seers sent from God, and directed to the way of peace, yet she seeth it not. Let those who assume to themselves most knowledge, take heed lest they be like Pentheus, Sapientes in omnibus praeterquam in iis in quibus sapientem esse convenit; wise in all things save those where wisedome might stead them.Eurip . He is not to be accoun∣ted a wise man (saith the wiseEurip . Poet) who knoweth simply most things, but who
knoweth things of most use. Is Jerusalem ignorant of the maine point of all, of the comming of the Messias, notwithstanding all the light she might have taken from the Law of Moses, & from the visions of the Prophets, & from the doctrine and miracles of our Saviour? how grosse then is that errour of all the rest in the Romish Church, by which shee maintaineth and holdeth, that she cannot erre? Was Jerusalem seated upon so high a hill, so neer hea∣ven, obscured with the fumes arising from the bottomlesse pit? and may not the City situated on seven hills have a thicke mist cast over her? What can shee plead for her immunity from errour in matter of faith more than Jerusalem could? that faith was planted in her by S. Peter? the Christian faith was planted in Jerusalem by Christ himselfe: that it was watered in her with the bloud of the Apostles? Jerusalem was watered with the bloud of Christ himselfe. If Rome can alledge any one promise made to her, Jeru∣salem can many. But to leave Rome, and come with a Nathans application to our selves, mee thinks, I heare Christ saying to us and our Church: If thou, even thou, if thou which art the Queen of all the reformed Churches; if thou which hast enjoyed the sun-shine of the Gospel without any e∣clipse by persecution for more than 60. yeers; if thou who hast had line up∣on line, precept upon precept, admonition after admonition, & exhortation after exhortation; if thou whom God hath miraculously preserved from imminent destruction by defeating the invincible Armado in eighty eight, & since discovering the matchlesse powder plot; if thou, even thou, who sittest quietly under thine own vine, when all thy neighbour vines are plucked up by the roots, or trampled under foot; if thou, even thou knowest not, or wilt not take notice of the things that belong to thy peace, At least in this thy day, that is, the day of thy visitation, the day of grace, a day given thee for this end, to provide for thy peace, to call thy selfe to an account, to consider how deeply thou hast engaged Gods justice to poure down the vialls of his vengeance upon thee, for thy rebellion against his or∣dinances, thy corporall and spirituall fornication, thy resisting the spirit of grace, thy peremptory refusing of the meanes of salvation, thy persecuting the truth, even to the death, and imbruing thy hands in the bloud of Gods dearest servants sent to thee early and late for thy peace. Jerusalem had a day, and every City, every Nation, every Church, every congregation, every man hath a day of grace, if he have grace to take notice of it; hath an accepted time, if he accept of it: and he may find God, if he seek him in time. It was day at Jerusalem in Christs time, at Ephesus in S. Johns time, at Corinth, Philippi, &c. in S. Pauls time, at Creet in Titus time, at Alexandria in S. Markes time, at Smyrna in Polycarps time, at Per∣gamus in Antipas time, at Antiochia in Evodius and Ignatius time, at Con∣stantinople in S. Andrew and Chrysostomes time, at Hippo in Saint Austines time; now in most of these it is night, it is yet day with us: O let us worke out ourPhil. 2.12. salvation with feare and trembling, whilest it isHeb. 3.7, 13. called to day; if the Sun of righteousnesse goe downe upon us, we must looke for nothing but perpetuall darknesse, and the shadow of death. Although Ninevehs day la∣sted forty daies, and Jerusalems forty yeers, and the old worlds 120. yeers, and although God should prolong our daies to many hundred yeeres, yet we should find our day short enough to finish our intricate accounts. That
day in the language of the holy Ghost is called our day, wherein wee either doe our own will and pleasure, or which God giveth us of speciall grace to cleare our accounts, and make our peace with him; but that is called the Lords day, either which he challengeth to himselfe for his speciall service, or which he hath appointed for all men to appeare before his Tribunall, to give an account of their own workes. A wicked man maketh Gods day his owne, by following his owne pleasures, and doing his own will upon it, and li∣ving wholly to himselfe, and not to God; but the godly maketh his owne daies Gods daies, by imploying them in Gods service, and devoting them as farre as his necessary occasion will permit wholly to him. Wherefore it is just with God to take away from the wicked part of his owne daies, by shortening his life upon earth, and to give to the godly part of his day, which is eternity in heaven. I noted before a flaw and breach in the sentence, as it were a bracke in a rich cloth of Tissu. If thou knewest in this thy day: what then? thou wouldst weep, saith S.Homil. in E∣vang. Gregory: thou wouldest not neglect so great salvation, saithComment. in Evag. Euthyrtius: it would bee better with thee, saith Titus Bostrensis: thou wouldst repent in sackcloth and ashes, saithBrug. in E∣vang. Brugensis. But I will not pre∣sume to adde a line to a draugh from which such a workman hath taken off his pensill, and for the print I should make after the pattern in my Text, and now in the application lay it close to your devout affections, I may spare my farther labour and your trouble: for it is made by authority, which hath commanded us to take notice of those things that belong to our peace, viz. to walke humbly with our God by fasting and prayer: wherefore junga∣mus fletibus fletus, lachrymas lachrymis misceamus; let us conspire in our sighes, let us accord in our groanes, let us mingle our teares, let us send up our joynt praiers as a vollie of shot to batter the walls of heaven: let all our hearts consort with our tongues, and our soules with our bodies: what wee doe or suffer in our humiliation, let it be willingly, and not by constrant; & let our praiers and strong cries in publike be ecchoed by the voice of our weeping in private: who knoweth whether God may not send us an issue out of our present troubles by meanes unexpected? who knoweth not whether he may not have calicem benedictionis, a cup of blessing in store for those his servants beyond the sea, who have drank deep of the cup of trem∣bling? Christ his bowells are not streightened, but our sins are enlarged, else it would be otherwise with them and with us. I have given you a generall prescription, will ye yet have more particular recipe's? take then an electu∣ary of foure simples: The first I gather from our Saviours garden, Let yourLuke 12.35. loines be girt, and your lamps in your hands. Let your loines be girt, that is, your lusts be curbed & restrained; and your lamps burning, that is, your devotions enflamed. Gird up your loines by mortification & discipline, and have your lamps burning, both the light of faith in your hearts, and of good workes in your hands. The second I gather from S. John Baptists garden,Matth. 3.8. Bring forth fruits meet for repentance, or worthy amendment of life: let your sorrowes beCyp de laps. Quam grandia peccavimus, tam granditer defleamus. answe∣rable to your sinfull joyes, let the fruit of your repentance equall, if not ex∣ceed the forbidden fruit of your sin; wherein ye have most displeased God, seek most to please him. Have ye offended him in your tongue by oathes?
please him now by lauding and praising his dreadfull name, and reproving swearing in others. Have ye offended in your eies by beholding vanity and casting lascivious glances upon fading beauty enticing to folly? make a co∣venant from henceforth with your eies, that they cast not a look upon the world, or the flesh's baits, imploy them especially from henceforth in reading holy Scriptures, and weeping for your sins. Have ye offended in thought? sanctifie now all your meditations unto him. Have ye offended in your sports? let now your delight bePsal. 1.2. in the Law of God, let the Scriptures bee yourAug. l. 11. confes. c. 2 Sint deliciae meae Scripturae tuae, nec fallar in iis, nec fallam ex iis. delicacies with S. Austine, meditate upon them day and night, make the Lords holy-day your delight, Esay 58.15. and honour him thereon, not fol∣lowing your owne waies, nor finding your owne pleasure, nor speaking your owne words. The third I gather from S. James his garden,Jam. 4.10. Cast down your selves be∣fore the Lord, and he will lift you up. The Lion contenteth himselfe with ca∣sting downe a man: if he couch under him, and make no resistance, he offe∣reth no more violence. Corpora magnanimo satis est prostrâsse Leoni. It is most true, if we speake of the Lion of the Tribe of Judah: for hee will not break a bruised reed, much lesse grind to powder a contrite heart. If A∣habs outward humiliation (who notwithstanding had sold himselfe to worke wickednes) in some degree appeased Gods wrath: how much will inward & outward humiliation of the redeemed of God prevaile with him to remove his heavie judgements from us, which he inflicteth on us, especially to hum∣ble us? and if he find us humbled already, hee will doubtlesse lay no more load upon us. The last I gather from King Davids garden:Psal. 2.12. Kisse the Son. God hath a controversie with us as he had with the Israelites in the daies ofHsea 4.1. Hosea, and no man can plead for us, but our1 Joh. 2.1. Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. We have so far provoked the Almighty, some by profanenesse, some by superstition, some by indifferency in point of Religion, some by covetousnesse and extortion, some by fraud and falshood, some by quarrel∣ling and contention, some by swearing and blaspheming, some by gluttony and drunkennesse, some by chambering and wantonnesse, that he hath alrea∣dy taken hold of his glittering sword, and who in heaven or in earth can or dare treat for our peace, but Christ our peace-maker, who hath signed a league of amity between God & all beleevers with his own bloud? Where∣fore, as Themistocles, understanding that King Admetus was highly dis∣pleased with him, took up his young sonne into his armes, and treated with the father holding that his darling in his bosome, and thereby appeased the Kings wrath; so let us come to the Father, with Christ in our armes: let us present our suites by him, He is ourAmb. l. 2. de Isaac. Ille ocu∣lus est per quem Deum videmus, ille dextera est per quam Deo of∣ferimus, ille os nostrum est per quod Pa∣trem alloqui∣mur. eye with which we see God, our hand by which we offer to him, he is our mouth by which we speake to him. By this eye we look upon thee, O thou that dwellest in the heavens; by this hand we of∣fer unto thee the incense of our zealous affections; by this mouth we send up our prayers with our sighes unto thee. O Lord turne thy face from our sins, and looke on thy well beloved Son in thy bosome: consider not our actions, but his passions: weigh not our transgressions, but his merits: regard not our sinfull pleasures, but his
painfull torments: respect not our wicked life, but his most innocent death: heale us by his stripes, cure us by his wounds, free us by his bonds, ease us by his torments, comfort us by his agony, and revive us by his death.
