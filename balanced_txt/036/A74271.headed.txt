lives, unlesse they shall also forsake the Christian Religion: And divers of those Your Subjects kept in bondage (being expert and skilfull Mariners) are usually imployed at Sea against others Your good Subjects, and prove very prejudiciall to them, and hurtfull to the Trade and Merchandise of Your Majesties Dominions: And whereas, aswell Your Majesties Subjects, as strangers Exporting, or Importing their Goods and Merchandize into this Kingdom, have ever sithence Your Majesties ac∣cesse unto this Crown, been charged with the pay∣ment of great sums of Money, under the name of Custom, and that without consent of Parliament, which had they been legally taken, ought to have been chiefly imployed to the safeguard of the Seas, and preservation of Your good Subjects in their Trade of Merchandize from the spoil of Pirats, and other Sea-robbers, but have been exhausted by evil Ministers, and not applied to their proper uses, so that Your Highnesse good Subjects have been exposed to the mercilesse cruelty of those Pirats, and barbarous Infidels.
