Londons Ioy and Tryumph. On the Installment of Sir William Pritchard LORD MAYOR for the Ensuing Year. To the Tune of, Tangier March. I. LEt the Whigs revile, The TORIES Smile, That their business is Compleated, Let all Rejoyce With Heart and Voice, That the Whig's at last Defeated. The Whigs for Loyalty so Fam'd, With all their hopes are Undone; Since now brave Pritchard is Proclaim'd The LOYAL Mayor of London. II. You Polish Brace Whose Brazen Face, To the Chair wou'd be Aspiring, See the Rabble Crowd Who Poll'd so Loud; Are bawk'd beyond Admiring; Learn in time to mitigate Your bold Tumultuous Fury, E're you shall find, you trust too late, To Ignoramus-Jury. III. Let Pâ€”r Tom Receive the Doom, So long due for his Cheating, Who did purloyn The CITY Coyn, To keep up Holy Meeting; To Rob the Orphan, and the Poor, His great Discharge of Trust is, And run upon the Widdows Score, To do the CITY Justice. IV. Let Ward Repent, And Jenks Relent, Their Practices so malitious, Let Hobland rue With all the Crew, That they were so Officious; Such Jews as these, who did deny Their Saviour for a Tester, No doubt again wou'd Crucify, Their Sovereign Lord and Master. V. For NORTH and RICH, And every such, They set up a Papillion; 'Gainst PRITCHARD hold, With Cornish, Gold, With Ryot and Rebellion: To love the KING can you pretend, Who Royallists deny all; And with such Vigour dare contend, Against the Man that's Loyal. VI. For shame in time Repent your Crime, Your Ryot and Commotion; And to the MAYOR, Who kept the Chair, Pay all your just Devotion; Such was their Loyalty of late, To give the KING no Money: But freely threw away their Plate, To joyn with Rebel TONEY. VII. Thus you before Did run on score With Royal CHARLES your Master; Like drunk or mad Spent all you had To uphold a bold Imposture: Let not Knaves again betray, And rob you of your Reason, Then leave your Factious Heads to pay The forfeit of your Treason. VIII. With all your heat What did you get? With all your din and quarter; But to involve With each Resolve The more-entangl'd CHARTER? To CHARLES your just Allegiance give, Your PROPERTIES, then plead 'em: Defending the PREROGATIVE, You best protect your FREEDOM. LONDON: Printed in the year MDCLXXXII.
