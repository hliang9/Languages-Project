THE Loyal Subjects LITTANY. FRom sawing the Crown 'twixt Phanaticks and Fryars, From Whitehall Scaffolds and Smithfield Fires, From the Jesuits Morals outdone by the Tryers, Libera nos Domine. From every Religion which Treason allows, From the Geneva stifness and the Roman bows, From affronting of God, or adoring of Shows, Libera nos Domine. From slicing the Pope into Presbyter John, More sawcy in Consort than he is alone, From a Legion of Devils to extirpate one, Libera nos Domine. From fermenting the Rout with Chimaerical fears, From buying with Blood and enjoying with Tears, A Liberty copied by that of Argiers, Libera nos Domine. From being twice chous'd with the same sort of Cant, From defending the King by Scotch Covenant, From reforming the Church till we leave nothing on't, Libera nos Domine. From a Bi-fronted Conscience like the Sign of an Alehouse, That faces the Church, and out faces the Gallows, With one side stark raw, and the other side Callous, Libera nos Domine. From a Supreme Vicar to shackle the King, From a long round Senate which means the same thing, From a Monk without, and a Devil within, Libera nos Domine. From advancing Gods Church by such sins as wo'd fright ye, From listing of Rebels to aid the Almighty, From taking of Rats-bane for Elixir Vitae, Libera nos Domine. From the Popish rage and the Popular fret, Which with brotherly Malice their Sov'raign beset, From rescinding Bull, and reforming Bullet, Libera nos Domine. From the Lords in the Tower, and the Lords that are out, From assaulting the King by Dagger or Vote, From our Ruin point blank, or Nine Mile about, Libera nos Domine. From the Dark Lanthorn-Plot, and the Green Ribbon Club, From brewing Sedition in a Sanctified Tub, From reforming a Prince by the Model of Job, Libera nos Domine. From the National Wealth by a Junto possest, By cajoling of one half, and plundering the rest. From the Commonwealths Arms with his Holiness's Crest. Libera nos Domine. LONDON, Printed in the Year 1680.
