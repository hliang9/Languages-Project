A FEW CONSIDERATIONS Humbly Offered to the Members of Parliament, To Obviate some Evil Jealousies and Designs, against the People called QƲAKERS. THat this Nation doth consist of People differing in Perswasion of Religion one from another, is unquestionable. That Coercion hath been found Ineffectual to bring all Men to Believe alike, is unquestionable also. That the Prudence and Wisdom of our Legislators, upon the late Revolution, thought it better to unite the King's Protestant Subjects in Interest and Affection, by suspending certain Penal Laws. That it hath had an agreeable Effect in most places in England, except where a few discontented Persons have not been easie, because they wanted Laws to disturb their Peaceable Neighbours. Though the People called Quakers are first the Object of such Mens Envy, yet if they can ruin the Quakers, they are not like to rest there. Pretentions of Popish Emissaries (among us) are Old and Scandalous, we are well known to our Neighbours; and if they knew any such Emissaries, the Law is still open against them, and we question not our Adversaries Activeness to have found them out, though it were only to blemish us. The Care we have of our Poor is well known, and well approved, and our Zeal to prevent disorderly Con∣versation ☞ We also Contribute our shares with our Neighbours to their Poor. among us, We hope is Justifiable in the Eye of the Government, and all Religious People, and yet both, Unpracticable without Meetings for those Ends. If Virulent Accusations of one anothers Principles should be Coun∣tenanc'd among Protestants, 'twould greatly tend to divert the good Intention of the Government, of Uniting in Affection those whom 'tis hard to Unite in Perswasion.
