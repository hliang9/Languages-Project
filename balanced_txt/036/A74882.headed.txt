The Declaration of the Esquire at Arms. FOrasmuch as the Barons of the Exchequer and other Judges of the Commonwealth of England have in their Judicature made a doubt whether the Parliament be dissolved or not, It is declared that the Parliament is dissol∣ved, And that all the actions of Oliver Cromwel Esquire, Captain-General of all the English Forces, be just, honest, and legal; and that he is a just and honest man in whatsoever he enter∣prised in the said affairs. And if any person or persons shall, by any colour or pretence what∣soever, attempt to question the Authority of the Lord General Cromwel, or disturb the peace of this Nation, the Free-born persons of England under his protection will call them to a severe account. Witness Tho. Elslyot, Ar.Ar. Conq. Dated the 7 of May. 1653.
