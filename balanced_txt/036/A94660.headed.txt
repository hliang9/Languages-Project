TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THE LORDS and COMMONS assembled in PARLIAMENT at Westminster. The humble Petition of the Knights, Gentry, Clergie, and Commonalty of the County of SUSSEX. Presented to both Houses upon Wednesday last, June 7. 1648. SHEWETH, THat the miserable effects of this civil War vnder which our Coun∣te, and three Kingdoms have long and heavily groaned, are the onely motives of these our humble and fervent Desires hreby propounded to Your Honours. 1. That our most gracious Soveraign Lord King CHARLES may be speedly and honourably received to a safe Treatie with the two Houses of Parliament, for the firm setling of a wel grounded Peace both in Church and Common-wealth, as also of his own just Rights, and of the Rights of Parliament. 2. That the Arrears of the Army vnder the command of the Lord Fair∣fax may be paid, and the Armie with all expedition disbanded. 3. That according to the Fundamental Constitutions of this Kingdome we may be governed by the known Laws of this Kingdome, and not other∣wise. 4. That from henceforth our estates and goods may be freed from all Taxes and Impositions. 5. That no Garrisons within the said Countie be any longer continued, and that the Ordnance and Ammunition taken from the Sea Towns may be returned for the better defence of them and the whole Countrie from for∣raign Invasions. We therefore (as the Well-affected Counties have already) doe humbly pray You to yeeld a present condescention to our humble Desires, That so our differences and divisions may be happily composed, all misunderstan∣dings between Prince and People timely removed, His Majesty (according to our solemn Engagement) rendred glorious, both King and Kingdome returned to their pristine dignity and splendor at home and abroad, and your selves thereby merit the gratefull and universall acclamations of good and faithfull Patriots. And your Petitioners shall pray, &c.
