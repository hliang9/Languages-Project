THARAM TANIAH, Leader of the LORDS Hosts, Ʋnto his Brethren the QƲAKERS scornfully so cal∣led, who ARE the Children of Abraham, Isaac, and Ja∣cob; who ARE circumcised in Heart; the JEWISH Race in descent, unto whom the Promise was made, I will turn them into my pure Language, by taking away their stony hearts: And they shall all Tremble at my Word. These things the Heathen dogs know not. BRETHREN, I Am that man JOSEPH whom my brethren sold into Aegypt: but the Lord is with me, for the Returning of my brethren. I finde THAT in the TABLES of heaven, which is the CABAL of ENOK the seventh from Adam, That God would cast off Israel and Judah Five hundred times five yeers, that is, not according to the Heathen Numberers, which are but Names, and are LY∣ERS: But according to the POLES of the Heavens, by their dimensions, which doth Gra∣diate the FIRE into our times of Numbers, Natures, and TRANSMUTATIONS: which TIME ceased on the 23 of November, when the Lord smote me dead in my shop, even in that particle Resh was the End, and a new beginning Arri Orari Oramoas Or RESH: then I received Ratification in Essency, but not in my own declared derivacy; but that grace received in my soul, it prevailed over me, and opened my Imprisoned soul to see, seek, and settle my soul on its Center. My Lambs, my weak Babes, I am, have been, and shall be, that weak appearance: but it is the Eternal Essence power, that without which none can receive Eternal life. But Brethren, now JOSEPH is JUDAH beloved of JAH, the prevalency with God, with Man, and over all things: Now, ye my Lambs, my Brethren, JOSEPH-JUDAH is REUBEN, that is, God's first sight, the highest discovery, and none can reach. Now REUBEN  JACOB's STAR prevailing with God, and God doth Turn REUBEN, which is AARON, nto MOSES: and that very Alone Spirit, am I through mercy made, for to lead forth my ambs, the Chosen of the LORD. Therefore, my Brethren, you know not me, though  you is Something That doth tender me, when you are strong. And, my Brethren, though e stand in ONE, and are taught from the living God Immediately within your souls, and o otherwise, This I do witness: Yet, my Brethren, the Lord is known unto me in sight, as to say, face to face, as the Lord imself shall shew you in the TABLE in which he teacheth you, and that shall hold you, d me, and all the Lord's Chosen. For I speak not to you to intrude into you, nor to ke any words from you: but ye are the SEAL upon my soul, which is the Lords Covenant r you, and you for me. So, my Brethren, not in Name, nor in corrupt Nature, but in the li∣ng Life within the SOUL of man ס which is the Eternal Spirit of the living God, which  the peoples Gatherer out of all VANITY and DARKNESS, and makes all his SO GA∣HERED one Unitie in himself by CHRIST CRISTOS. rote in the Tent of Judah, after my humble Offering on VAUTIAL, the Tenth DAY NISAN, By me THAURAM TANIAH, Leader for the Captivities return.
