To the Honourable the COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED. The humble Petition of the Reduced Officers and Souldiers intrusted on the be∣halfe of the subscribers of a late Petition presented to this Honourable House. Sheweth, THat their deep sence of those uncessant and endlesse clamours that did attend your Honours, the extream Pennury and thraldome of their fellow Officers and Souldiers, and your Honours willingnesse to remove the same (exprest by your severall Notes and Orders) encouraged them to contrive such a way for their present subsistance, and future satisfaction, as they humbly con∣ceived might be most effectuall to those ends, and least prejudiciall or obstructive to the grand affaires of this Kingdome, which being referred to a select Committee, was after se∣verall debates approved on, then the particular heads twice read in this Honourable House, first Committed and at last past, and ordered that an Ordinance should be brought in, in pursuance thereof, which respective considerations has invited your Petitioners, to an E∣laborate and expensive attendance, wherein, if they shall be longer delayed they must inevitably be ruined and the rest perish, And left their silence might argue a guilt, they have thought fit to take notice of some un-merited prejudices, that are thrown upon them by converting the prosecution of their honest intention, into a dishonest and destructive designe, wherein they presume the said Committee will give sufficient Testimony of their Candid affections, and constant Honor to this House, expressed by their Civilityes in all their Addresses to them. The premises your Petitioners humbly submit to your Honours consideration and there∣fore pray That you would no longer prerogue the passing of the Ordinance, now before you, so as by vertue thereof, there may be an evident assurance to gaine the pre∣sent advance of the hundred thousand pounds already voted to make up the three Moneths full pay, those indurance released and all protected, for pre∣vention of those cruell and un-heard-of miseries that will otherwise of necessity acrue to the said Petitioner, whose inforced cryes and unpittyed sufferings. (for want of their so dearly-deserved sallary) cannot but attract some heavy judgments from the God of Justice on this whole Nation which wee dread to think on, it being in no humane power, but yours to divert and whereby you will perpetuate your former engagements on them which is the hearty Prayers of James Mydhope, Richard Sandys, Edward Aldrich, Walter Bosvill, Edward Freeman, John White, William Tovey, John Fincher,
