THE Traytors Rewarded: Or, the Execution and Confession of Edward Fitz Harris AND Oliver Plunket, Two Notorious Traytors, Who were drawn to Tyburn on Sledges, and there Executed on the first of this Instant July, 1681. For contriving, and Trayte∣rously carrying on the late Hellish PLOT, by not only devising to destroy the Life of his Majesty, but to deliver up these King∣doms to a Forreign Power, &c. EDward Fitz Harris (as his own Narrative, or rather Examina∣tion taken by the Right Honourable the Secretary of State) was Born in Ireland, being Son to Sir Edward Fitz Harris, and there bred up in the Popish Superstitions and Idolatrous Tenents, from whence, as from the Fountain of all Mischief, he sucked in his wicked Principles, which turned him even into a Monster in nature, and Atreus like, to feed upon the Bowels of his own Country, and destroy those whose Charity and Bounteous Inclination, had saved him from Perishing. For having espoused the Catholick Cause, he was resolved to shew himself a Spawn of those mischievous Spirits, the Blood-thirsty Jesuits; so that undertaking to bring that Monster into the world, which Mother Cellier, with all her dexte∣rity in Midwifry could not do, whereupon he, by the advice (as he himself confessed) of the French Ambassadors Confessor, frames or draws up several Treasonable heads, and by putting them into a Libel, and dispersing the Copies, hoped to raise the whole Nation to bear Rebellious Armes against his Prince; but his contrivance being laid too shallow, it was revealed by Mr. Everard, the person to whom he applied himself for the compacting it the better under the shelter of his Name to carry on the design; but his Treasonable
Papers being secured, and he apprehended, was committed first to Newgate, and after that, for some weighty Reasons, sent to the Tower, where he lay as it were in suspence, with longing expecta∣tion, being desirous to see the Event; so that after the several de∣bates held about his Plea to that Courts Jurisdiction, by reason of his having been Impeached by the Commons, he on Thursday the 9th of June 1681. was brought to his Tryal in earnest, where it was proved against him by several witnesses, that he was in the first place a notorious Papist, and that he not only held correspondence with Conspirators, but that himself had brought the heads of a most Treasonable, false and scandalous Libel to be model'd, and put into a smoother Method, this Mr. Everard Swore, and that Fitz Harris bringing the Libel to him, after some words passing, desired that he would undertake the putting of it into form, who to find out what new Stratagem was in hand, seemed to wink at his Treasonable Speeches which he frequently used, till getting Sir William Waller and Mr. Smith to stand in an adjacent Room to hear and see him; so that having sufficiently discovered his design, they thought fit to secure him, and found several Treasonable Notes under his own hand writing: The Libel contained Treason in the highest degree, and therefore no wonder if his Name sake afterward call'd it, Treason in Grain. Its main end and design was, to put a division between the King and his people, by creating gross misunderstand∣ings, and to effect this, it was fraught with all the Calumnies that a malicious and bitter Spirit could invent, to perswade the Multi∣tude into a belief, that his Majesty designed to establish Popery and Arbitrary Government; to hindes which, as was pretended, he admonished them to take up Armes and unanimously Rebel, so to Dethrone and Depose him; and whilst the people were cut∣ting one anothers Throats, the French were to Land and have finish∣ed the Tragedy. For this he was cast, and received Sentence of Death according to the Merits of his Treason, after which, he was carried back with a strong Guard to the Tower, where he made some offers to discover who imploy'd him; but we cannot hear they amounted to any thing of moment; but his discourse for the most part was about things insignificant, desiring to speak with se∣veral persons of worth, who knowing his former Villanous designs to Ruin some person of Honour, they declined going; but he had the counsel and good advice of able Divines, and seemed much in∣clinable to Abjure the Idolatrous Superstitions of the Church of Rome. Being in the Sledge for that purpose prepared, he cast his Eyes very wishfully upon the people, as is supposed, to see whom
he knew, and having a Book in his hand, he looked in it at times, but with so dejected a countenance, that some thought him half dead with fear, continuing so till he came to Tyburn, where after he had made some short Speech, expressing the guilt he lay under, and desiring Gods Mercy to his Soul, the Executioner ended his wretched Life. OLiver Plunket, Born in the Kingdom of Ireland, but for the most part, had his Education at St. Omers in the Kingdom of France, from whence going to Salamanca, he staid there till he was qualified to go to Rome for Orders, which he did after some time, and obtained them, becoming (as it is for certain rela∣ted) a Benedictine Monk; and about eight years since returned for Ireland, under the Character of Arch-Bishop of Dublin, which Arch-Bishoprick the Pope (although he had no more to do with it than the Turk) would needs bestow upon him, enjoyning all the Popish Clergy of that Kingdom to own him such, but instead of effectually possessing it, he has met with a more deserved advance∣ment at Tyburn, for conspiring to Murther and Depose the Lords Anointed his lawful King, which appeared upon his Tryal at the Kings-Bench-Barr on the 8th of June, after this manner. Several Evidences (who for the major part were Popish Priests) appearing against him, gave Testimony, that he had Trayterously conspired to deliver up the Kingdom of Ireland to the French King, who (at the time appointed) was to Land an Army of 70000 Men, and having Conquer'd it (making miserable Havock of the Prote∣stants) he was to Establish the Popish Religion, and to bring that Kingdom (as formerly) under obedience to the See of Rome; and the better to accomplish such his Treasonable designs, Carligan was to be deliver'd up as a commodious Landing place; Money was Raised, and Men and Armes were to be Raised to joyn with the Forreign Forces. Thus were their projects laid, but they went no farther, for not long after the Discovery of the Plot, he was apprehended and con∣fined a close Prisoner in the Castle, from whence by Habeas Corpus or especial Order, he was brought over into England to answer for his Treasonable conspiracies, and upon a full hearing, found guilty, when on the 15th following, the Sentence which the Law requires in case of Treason, was passed upon him, which was to be Drawn, Hang'd, and Quarter'd; before and after which he made several Apologies about the Impossibility of several particulars, to which the Evidence had Sworn: As likewise solemn Protestations of his
Innocency, desiring leave of the Court that one of his Servants might come to him in Private, who (as 'tis said) is an Irish Priest or Jesuit, who (without doubt) served him in nature of his Confessor, and whilst he remained in Prison, many Devout Catholicks came to visit him, and receive his Benedictions, as one of the Sanctified Sons of Mother Church, encouraging him to stand stoutly to his tackle, and not by any shew of fear, give the Hereticks occasion to conclude him guilty, but to suffer couragiously for the Cause, and amongst those that gave him such cordial Counsel (perhaps) to the Ruin of his Soul, were the ever active Maddam Cellier, and the Jesuits under condemnation. In fine, he behaved himself very humble and meek, being often heard to Pray, especially to the Virgin Mary, for her assistance, to support him in his Tribulations and Sufferings for the Church, as he termed them. Being often admonished to suffer some Protestant Ministers to come to him, and pray with him, he refused it, saying, That he had espoused the Romish Religion for many years past, and was fully satisfied of its Efficacy unto Salvation, and therefore desired them to excuse him, if he denied to converse with any other then the professors of it now he was going out of the world; for as he al∣leadged, that might occasion scruples and doubts, and make him the more uneasie in the matter of Conscience: These, and such like, were his allegations, and so he continued during his confine∣ment in Newgate. He seems but little concern'd in his way to the place of Execu∣tion, only was observed to Mumble to himself (as it is imagined) some formal Prayers; he being an Aged man, and very comely, being past doubt a Man of great parts, which occasioned several tender hearted Protestants to pity him, that by such destable Villany he should bring himself to so Ignominious a Death. Fitz Harris was brought in a Sledge from the Tower, and called upon his Brother at Newgate, from whence they went together. London, Printed for Richard Hill, Anno Dom. 1681.
