AN AGREEMENT OF THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND And the places therewith INCORPORATED, For a secure and present Peace, upon Grounds of Common Right, Freedom and Safety. HAving by our late labors and hazards made it appear to the world at how high a rate we value our Just Freedom, and God having so far owned our cause as to deliver the Enemies thereof into our hands, We do now hold our selves bound in mutual duty to each other to take the best care we can for the future, to avoid both the danger of returning into a slavish condition, and the chargeable remedy of another War: For as it cannot be imagined, That so many of our Countrymen would have opposed us in this Quarrel, if they had understood their own good, so may we hopefully promise to our selves, That when our Com∣mon Right and Liberties shall be cleared, their endeavors will be disappointed, that seek to make themselves our Masters, since therefore our former oppressions, and not yet ended troubles, have been occasioned, either by want of frequent National Meetings in Councel, or by the undue or unequal Constitution thereof, or by rendering those meetings uneffectual. We are fully agreed and resolved (God willing) to provide, That hereafter our Representatives be neither left to an uncertainty for time, nor be unequally constituted, nor made useless to the ends for which they are intended. In Order whereunto We Declare and Agree; 1.

Provided also, That where any City or Burrough to which one Representor or more is assign'd shall be found in a due proportion, not competent alone to elect a Representor, or the number of Representors assign'd thereto, it is left to future Representatives to assign such a number of Parishes or Villages near adjoyning to such City or Burrough, to be joyned therewith in the Elections, as may make the same propor∣tionable. 3. That the people do of course choose themselves a Representative once in two years, and shall meet for that purpose upon the first Thursday in every second May, by eleven of the Clock in the morning, and the Representatives so chosen to meet upon the second Thursday in June follow∣ing at the usual place in Westminster, or such other place as by the foregoing Representative, or the Councell of State in the interval, shall be from time to time appointed and published to the People, at the least twenty days before the time of Election: And to continue their Session there or elsewhere until the second Thursday in December following, unless they shall adjourn, or dissolve them selves sooner, but not to continue longer.

And in all Elections, (ex∣cept for the Universities,) they shall be men of one and twenty years old, or upwards, and house-keepers, dwelling within the Devisi∣on for which the Election is provided, That untill the end of seven years next ensuing the time herein limited, from the end of this pre∣sent Parliament, no person shall be admitted to, or have any hand or voice in such Elections, who hath adhered unto, or assisted the King against the Parliament, in any the late Warrs, or Insurrections, or who shall make or joyn in, or abet any forcible opposition a∣gainst this Agreement. 2.

And also provided, That such persons as by the rules in the preceding Article are not capable of electing untill the end of seven yeares, shall not be capable to be elected until the end of 14. years, next ensuing. And we do desire and recommend it to all men, that in all times the persons to be chosen for this great trust, may be men of courage, fearing God, and hating covetousnesse, and that our Representatives would make the best provisions for that end. 3.

And if he have not such an estate, then he shall incur the pain of Imprisonment, for three moneths; And if any person shall forcibly oppose, molest, or hinder the people, (capable of electing as aforesaid) in their quiet and free Election of Representors, for the first Representative, then each person so offending, shall incur the penalty of confiscation of his whole Estate, both reall and personall; and (if he have not an Estate to the value of fifty pounds) shall suffer imprisonment during one whole yeare without Baile, or Mainprize. Provided, That the Offender in each such case, be convicted within three Moneths next af∣ter the committing of his offence; And the first Representative is to make further provision for the avoiding of these evills in af∣ter Elections. 4. That to the end, all Officers of State may be certainly accomptable, and no Factions made to maintaine corrupt interests, no Members of a Councell of State, nor any Officer of any Salary forces in Army, or Garrison, nor any Treasurer, or Receiver of publike monies shall (while such) be elected to be of a Representative.

And the same Commissioners, or any three, or more of them, for the severall Counties, Cities, and Burroughs, respectively, shall, where more then three Representors are to be chosen, divide such Counties (as also the City of London) into so many, and such parts as are afore mentioned, and shall set forth the bounds of such Divisions, and shall in every County, City and Burrough, where any Representors are to be chosen, and in eve∣ry such Division as aforesaid within the City of London, and within the severall Counties so divided, respectively, appoint one cer∣tain place wherein the people shall meet for the choice of their Representors, and some one fit person, or more, inhabiting within each Burrough, City, County, or Division, respectively, to be present at the time and place of Election, in the nature of Sheriffes, to regulate the Elections, and by Pole, or otherwise, clearly to distinguish and judge thereof, and to make return of the person or per∣sons Elected, as is hereafter exprest, and shall likewise in writing under their Hands and Seales make Certificates of the severall Di∣visions (with the bounds thereof) by them set forth, and of the certaine places of meeting, and Persons in the nature of Sheriffes appointed in them respectively, as aforesaid, and cause such Certificates to be returned into the Par∣liament Records before the end of April next, and before that time shall also cause the same to be published in every Parish within the Counties, Cities, and Burroughs, respectvely, and shall in every such Parish likewise nominate and appoint (by Warrant under their Hands and Seales) one trusty per∣son or more, inhabiting therein, to make a true list of all the persons within their respective Pa∣rishes, who according to the rules aforegoing are to have voyce in the Elections, and expressing, who amongst them are by the same rules capable of being elected, and such List (with the said Warrant) to bring in, and returne at the time and place of Election, unto the person appointed in the nature of Sheriffe, as aforesaid, for that Burrough, City, County, or Division respectively; which Person so appointed as Sheriff, being present at the time and place of Election; or in case of his absence by the space of one hour after the time limited for the Peoples meeting, then any Person present that is elible, as aforesaid, whom the People then and there assembled shall chuse for that end, shall receive and keep the said Lists, and admit the Persons therein contained, or so many of them as are present unto a free Vote in the said Election, and having first caused this Agreement to be publiquely read in the audience of the People, shall proceed unto, regulate and keep peace and order in the Elections, and by Pole, or otherwise, openly distinguish and judg of the same: And thereof by Certificate, or writing, under the Hands and Seals of himself, and six or more of the Electors (nominating the Person or Persons duly Elected) shall make a true return into the Parliament Records, within one and twenty days after the Election (under pain for default thereof, or for making any false Return to forfeit one hundred pounds to the Publique use:) And shall cause Indentures to be made, and interchangeably sealed and deli∣vered betwixt himself, and six or more of the said Electors on the one part, and the Persons, or each Person Elected severally on the other part, expressing their Election of him as a Representor of them, according to this Agreement, and his acceptance of that trust, and his promise accordingly to perform the same with faithfulness, to the best of his understanding and ability, for the Glory of God, and good of the People.

We do not impower them to impresse, or constrain any person to serve in Forraign War either by Sea or Land, nor for any Military Service within the Kingdome, save that they may take order for the forming, training, and exercising of the people in a military way to be in readinesse for resisting of Forraigne Invasions, suppressing of sudden Insurrections, or for assisting in execution of Law; and may take order for the imploying and conducting of them for those ends; Provided, that even in such cases none be compellable to go out of the County he lives in, if he procure another to serve in his room. 2.

That no Representative may in any wise render up, or give, or take away any the Foundations of common Right, Liberty & Safety con∣tained in this Agreement; nor levell mens Estates, destroy Propriety, or make all things common: And that in all matters of such funda∣mentall concernment, there shalbe a liberty to particular Members of the said Representatives to enter their dissents from the major vote. 9. Concerning Religion, we agree as followeth. 1. It is intended, that Christian Religion be held forth and recommended, as the publike profession in this Nation, which we desire may by the grace of God be reformed to the greatest purity in Doctrine, Worship and Discipline, according to the Word of God. The instructing of the people whereunto in a publike way (so it be not compulsive) as also the maintaining of able Teachers for that end, and for the confutation or discovery of Heresie, Error, and whatsoever is contrary to sound Doctrine, is allowed to be provided for by our Representatives; the maintenance of which may be out of a publike Treasury, and we desire not by Tythes. Provided, that Po∣pery or Prelacy be not held forth, as the publike way or profession in this Nation. 2. That to the publike profession so held forth, none be compelled by penalties or otherwise; but onely may be endeavoured to be won by sound Doctrine, and the example of a good Conversation. 3. That such as professe Faith in God by Jesus Christ, (however differing in judgement from the Doctrine, Worship or Discipline pub∣likely held forth, as aforesaid) shall not be restrained from, but shall be protected in the profession of their Faith, and exercise of Reli∣gion according to their Consciences, in any place (except such as shall be set apart for the publike Worship, where we provide not for them, unlesse they have leave) so as they abuse not this liberty to the civil injury of others, or to actuall disturbance of the publike Peace, on their parts: neverthelesse it is not intended to be hereby provided, That this Liberty shall necessarily extend to Popery or Prelacy. 4. That all Laws, Ordinances, Statutes, and clauses in any Law, Statute or Ordinance to the contrary of the Liberty herein, provided for in the two particulars next preceding concerning Religion, be and are hereby repealed and made void. 10. It is agreed, That whosoever shall by Force of Armes, resist the Orders of the next or any future Representative (except in case where such Representative shall evidently render up, or give, or take away the Foundations of common Right, Liberty and Safety con∣tain'd in this Agreement) shall forthwith after his or their such Resistance, lose the benefit and protection of the Laws, and shall be pu∣nishable with Death, as an Enemy and Traitor to the Nation. Of the things exprest in this Agreement, The certain ending of this Parliament (as in the first Article) the equall or proportionable distribution of the number of the Representators to be elected (as in the second) The certainty of the peoples meeting to elect for Re∣presentatives Bienniall, and their freedom in Elections, with the certainty of meeting, sitting and ending of Representatives so elected (which are provided for in the third Article) as also the Qualifications of Persons to elect or be elected (as in the first and second particulars under the third Article) Also the certainty of a number for passing a Law or preparatory debates (provided for in the fourth Article) The matter of the fifth Article, concerning the Councell of State: and of the sixth, concerning the calling, sitting and ending of Representatives extraordinary: Also the power of Representatives to be, as in the eigth Article, and limited, as in the six reserves next following the same. Likewise the second and third particulars under the ninth Article concerning Religion, and the whole matter of the tenth Article. All these we do account and declare to be fundamentall to our common Right, Liberty and Safety; and therefore do both agree thereunto, and resolve to maintain the same, as God shall enable us. The rest of the matters in this Agreement, we account to be usefull and good for the publike, and the particular circumstances of numbers, times and places, expressed in the severall Articles, we account not fundamentall, but we find them necessary to be here determined for the making the Agreement certain and practicable, and do hold these most convenient that are here set down, and therefore do positively agree thereunto. FINIS. Memorandum, That the Commissi∣oners for the respective Counties, Cities, and Burroughs, are to return a Computation of the number of Subscribers in the severall Parishes unto the Trustees herein named, before the end of April next, at such place, and in such form as the said Trustees, or any five, or more of them shall direct.
