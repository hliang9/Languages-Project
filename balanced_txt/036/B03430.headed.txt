The Farmers Reformation: OR, a Pattern for all Bad Husbands to Amend their Lives. When all is spent, there's no content, but Sorrow will attend: Before too late, renew thy State, and learn thy Life to mend. Tune of, the Ladyes of London. This may be printed, R. P. I Have been such a bad Husband of late, that trouble and sorrow's ensuing Having consumed a worthy Estate, which almost has proved my Ruine. Now I resolve to alter my Life, that Comforts I may be possessing, And will be loving and kind to my Wife; there can be no greater a blessing. How like a sorrowful Man do I look; I troubled am out of measure; When I consider'd the courses I took, while I was consuming my treasure: Every Day I wasted my store, and call'd a good Husband a Miser; But I resolve I will do so no more, but leave off, and learn to be wiser. When to the Market I went with my Corn, as soon as I sold it, to Gaming: I spent more free than a Gentleman born; yet thought I wan't worthy of blaming. Some I would lend, to others I'de give, and they'd be as commonly craving: But I will do so no more while I live, I'll learn to be Thrifty and saving. I from the Ale-house to the Tavern wou'd come, with those that wou'd call me their honey: All the long night I would seldom come home, as long as I had any Money, While my poor Wife shed many a Tear, to see how I dayly did use her: But I will now be more kind to my Dear, and never no more will abuse her. By this my Gaming I soon made a hand of what my old Father did leave me, As being forced to Morgage my Land; this did of all Comfort bereave me: So that I then was near to despair, and gave my self to melancholly: But at length I resolv'd to take care, now, now, I have seen my own folly. While to that ruinous rate I did run, I seldom or never repented, Till I perceived that I was undone, and then I was grievd and lamented; Yet I resolvd this course I would take, for the future time that's ensuing, All my bay Company I would forsake; I found they had proved my Ruine. My Goods and Comforts doth daily increase, by Labour I this have obtained, And my kind Wife has the blessing of peace, since Company I have refrained: Yet my old Cronys flout me each day, and count me no more than a Miser; Yet I'll not value what ever they say, I mean to grow older and wiser, E'ry bad Husband take warning by this, and count it not as a dead Letter: Though by your Folly you have done amiss, 'tis never too late to grow better: If thou hast got a loving kind wife, then, then, thou hast reason to prize her; Ay and to Love her as dear as thy Life, and always grow older and wiser. London, Printed for R. Kell, at the Blew Anchor near Pye-Corner.
