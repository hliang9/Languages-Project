AN ESSAY To Suppress, Prophaness and Immorality, Pay the Nations Debts, Support the Government, and Maintain the Poor. Humbly submitted to the LORDS Spiri∣tual, Temporal, and COMMONS Assem∣bled in Parliament. By a SOCIETY for REFORMATION of MANNERS.Whereas an E vlen for the Exne, is the Grand ob∣jection, the Reader is de∣sired to look upon the 11th Consideration, and Reflect up∣on a continual Pole, and sup∣pose that it Commence 3 Months before the Excise cea∣seth, there will be no stop of the Revenue; It may be Ne∣cessary to give 6 Months time to dispose of Retailers goods; also that they may find some o∣ther Imploy∣ments, which no doubt but honest men may do. IT is not unknown to all English men, how frequently His Majesty has recommended to the several Parliaments in his Reign, the suppressing Vice, and that several good Bills has been added to those of former Reigns, and a particular Recommendation given to the Lords Judges, that in their respective Circuits, they should enjoyn their Execu∣tion; but the small product these Laws and injunctions have made, would make a Man almost fancy a possibility of Chy∣merical Acts of an English Parliament, which would be af∣frontive, if not dangerous to Assert; tho' there is not much difference between Chymera's and Impossibilities; and I dare affirm, that it is, and ever will be next to an impossibility, to mend English Men and their Manners, whilst a Latitude is given them to gratifie Corrupt Nature in the Epidemick Di∣sease of Drinking Strong-Drink, as much and as oft as they can or please; but how this can be prevented is the Herculian La∣bour which has not yet been scarce so much as thought on, and for its impractibility, not attempted in any Authoritative man∣ner; Therefore the Love I have for my Native Country, and
sincere Desire of their Welfare, makes me cast my Mite into the vast Treasury of others Labours: ☞ And suppose that the Prices of all Strong-Drinks that are Sold by Retail were set∣led by Act of Parliament to such a Price, as only wholesom Table Small-Beer could be afforded to be Brewed for Sale, the consequence is the most natural cogitation in the World; (for Ablata Causa, tollitur Effectus.) And that Strong-Drink is the Cause of almost all our National Misfortunes, is deducible from Matter of Fact, the Solidest of Arguments He must have but little Understanding, and less Grace, that will plead either Custom or Convenience against it; For under these two Heads are Reducible all that can be said concerning it; as to the former, I hope the sooner we are shut of Evil Cu∣stoms the better; and let any one prove that selling of Strong-Drink by Retail is a good Custom, as it is used in England, if he can. I deny it, and Challenge all Opponents, but Drunkards and Fools, which I hope exempt themselves from being answered (by their very Names.) And for the Latter, the most material are the Consumption of the Growth of the Kingdom, the Revenue arising there∣from; the usefulness of stronger Drink, than Table-Beer for the behoof of Mankind, and Ruin of the present Families de∣pending thereupon; and to each of these, I shall say a little out of much, that may hereafter be said, if occasion be. For it is no easy matter when men are got into a Road that leads to Interest and Ease, to perswade them to change it, or go the least way about to attain an ungotten Treasure, tho' never so certain at last. To begin therefore with the Consumption of Corn, the Growth of the Nation. I conceive that whatsoever Com∣modity is brought to perfection in a Country, and destroyed in the same, may support, but will not enrich that Country; But thousands of Lasts of Corn is brought to perfection in England, and consumed by the excessive Debauchery of Drink∣ing Strong-Drink, to the Encouragement of all manner of Vice, and beyond the Necessity of almost any single Person; Therefore this Consumption is no way profitable to the Nation, but highly detrimental in the sight of God, and any reasonable and good Man. 2ly, In regard of the Revenue arising therefrom, it is a con∣tradiction to pretend to suppress Vice and expect a Support
by its Continuance; and that Government must have a bad foundation, which is Built upon the destruction of Body and Soul of its People; 'Tis confessed, that vast Sums do acrue to the King's Coffers, which yet is but one Sixth of the Product of so much Corn wasted in Mault: For besides what goes to the Maintaining Brewers and Ale-House-keepers in Pride and Luxury, all the rest is piss'd a∣against the Wall, and so much Money returned to make men Wicked and Poor. We always say, 'Tis opportunity makes the Thief; and what is it that makes the Profane and Drunkards, but a Liberty and Opportunity to be so? For if no Strong-Drink were to be sold, (as it is in every Hole and Corner, and at every place with full License to Drink as long as they can pay) the Coun∣try Gentlemen, Tradesmen, Mechanicks and Plowmen, would be sober and frugal in spite of their Teeths; the Latters Families would be maintained in Honesty and commendable easy Fashion: And all the Complaints of our Mechanicks, That they are eaten out by Foreigners, would be frivolous; For 'tis their own  Drinking, that devours their Wages; whereas the others parsimonious Living, impower them to sell Cheaper, and perhaps better Wares than can be afforded, or perhaps made by the best of our Ingenious Ar∣tists, who are usually Named with this detractive: He is an Ingenious Fellow but a Pot-Companion; and the Name of Poor would be almost forgotten in a little time; For, tho' it is tru∣ly said in an Ingenious Paper, Relating to a National Fishery, That most People at the Gallows complain, That Necessity brought them thither; it may be as wisely considered, that their own Extravagancy was the Occasion of that necessity. For in our Nation, we are so Plentifully supplied by the Almighty's Bounty, with all Things Necessary to our Welfare, if we could but understand the right use of them; that to see a Beggar in health between 10 and 60 years of Age, would bespeak either Knavery or great Folly in them and the whole Parish they belong to, provided there was no Ale sold by Re∣tail. But whilst that is suffered, the Fault lies in neither, as it is not in their Power to Redress. And if by Redressing this Mortal Grievance, there should arise some Inconvenience for want of the Accustomed supply for the Government. It cannot be supposed but the Wisdom of our Senators can
supply that defect by some other Tax, which every man would be able pay, by reason they could not spend their Money ex∣travagantly, and the Taxation would lie more equal, For now he that Spends most, Pays most, yet has the most need to keep his Money. And such Men will escape with sober Heads and full Pockets, for other Uses in their Families: And Corn might be always had at Reasonable Rates; and great Stores kept in publick Granaries to supply our selves and Neighbours, in less plentiful years. It may be taken for Granted, that mankind naturally ab∣hors perfect Idleness; and if in Drinking nothing but the Ap∣petite was indulged, Men would soon be weary of it. But under the Notion of Conversation, Idle and Profane Talk, Cursing, and Swearing, (which they call Pleasant Company) betrays them into loss of Time, Health, Wealth, Body, and I doubt, too many Souls into the Bargain, which would be absolutely prevented by having no Drink sold, but such as is proper to quench Thirst, which is all that Wise Nature re∣quires at our hands for her support; and if any, or all men were Necessitous by their ha to drink stronger, Let them Brew and welcome. I am fully perswaded, they will soon be weary of giving their Drink away. For besides the Charge, none but a perfect Beast will be willing to di∣sturb his own Family, (not even with his best Friends often.) And should a few dissolute Persons, in contempt of Virtue, and in defiance to the Regular part of Mankind, presume to continue Debauchery in their own Houses, they would soon render themselves the Object of every Man's Scorn, which would presently make them Scorn themselves for their presum∣ptuous Folly. 'Tis most likely that another great Convenience would Spring from hence. (viz.) The ordinary sort of People may set an example of a temperate Hospitality, which has been of late turn'd into a Debaucht Ebriety and Voraciousness among the ablest and those we call the greater Persons; and by this means all the indispensable Necessity of Strong Drink will be answer'd to a Tittle, as I shall make it appear more fully in a Book that will be ready for the Press against the next Session of Parlia∣ment: In which will be answered all Objections in Relation to Travellers, Commerce (and the subsistance of a Standing Force, if it be thought necessary for the Honour and safety of the
Kingdoms) and all other Objections, with submission to the Correction and Amendments of abler Heads and more culti∣vated Councels. Lastly, As to the present Persons maintained by Retailing Strong-Drink: If a few People, that from Nothing (an Ale∣house being the last shift) are grown Opulent and haughty by other Men's Misfortunes, and their own not over honest Management, are to be preferred before a Common Good, that will furmount all the Benefits that have accrued to our Nation, for almost two Centuries, I'll submit; but whilst that be made apparent, I must take the liberty to say, That if our Ancestors did wisely descent from the Superstitions of the Church of Rome, their Posterity are become as blind I dolators of their own Paunches; and instead of Wooden, have set up Belly-Gods to themselves. I shall conclude this Paper with the Opinion of a Person concerning Tobacco, (viz.) He believed it was an Invention of the Devil; and that Satan, foreseeing the Ruine of his Em∣pire in America, by the Christians, did sore-close (as we may call it) their Undeg, by causing those Poor People (then absolutely at his disposal) to Worship him with Fire and Smoak out of their Mouths; by which Means it became habitual, and was used promiscuously for Diversion and Sacrifice, when the Europians arrived in their Country. A thing so contrary to Nature, that none but Lucifer could propose it; yet with their Gold, their new Guests swallowed their Custom of Smoak∣ing, and transmitted them to us; and to compleat the more than pagent Tragedy, we have added Drinking thereto, and by that means have fulfilled the subtil Enemies Designs, and raised him a New Empire in Europe, for the loss of his old one in America; which I fear, is but too true, I'll insert a Story out of the Turkish History, which I read long since; and not having the Book by me, cannot insert the place; but 'tis in substance; That one of their Emperours, ha∣ving in some of his Wars observed, that his Army mouldred away insensibly, asked the Muffti, what should be the cause of it? Who answered, That he could give no other Reason, than that the Soul∣diers, who used to Eat Rice Bread and other wholesome Food, had of late lived upon fire and smoak, which could not long Nourish, but consume Nature. Upon which a Law was made against Smoaking and bringing Tobacco into the Camp; But a Mer∣chant
more Covetous than honest, would venture to bring some; which being discovered to the Grand Seignior, he caused him to be tyed to a Stake, his Tobacco set about him, and made one smoaking serve for all. A good example, only a little Turkish. My Lords and Gentlemen, THE Author of this Fssay, having (some time since) sent it to our Society, it was considered amongst us, and (for its rare and compleat Defign, exquisite penetration of Thought and Intention) conceived worthy to be published upon the Credit of its own Basis; but the Members of the Society (who desire to be unknown as yet) being Absent, and the Printer mistaking the Design, by thinking it done only to gain a Penny, did put an unintended Title to it, by which it pas∣sed for no better than Grubstreet, nay not half so well; for the Hawk∣ers could not sell it for any thing; it was too weighty and consum∣mate for the paultrey Admirers of their Merchandizes. Yet the Title forbad any Man of Sense to Look upon it. But the Society being en∣courag'd by His Majesty's repeated  and most Christian Desires for Suppressing Vice and Prophaneness; and by the Exam∣ple of so many Persons of the Greatest Rank (in this most Honoura∣ble House) that have subscribed their approbation of a Book, En∣tituled, An Account of the Societies, for Reformation of Manners; Wherein all Persons are earnestly exhorted to be Assistant to so good a Work in their respective Capacities, they (by God's Assi∣stance) resolved to pursue the Author's Design, so far as to lay it before this Honourable House, the proper Fountain from whence such streams of Goodness must derive, which is the utmost they can in their present Circumstances do; and tho' they pretend not to set the Project in the clearest Light by this small hint, yet they are prompt to hope and believe, that by the Sage Cultivation of this Honourable House, this Embrio may easily be formed into an Ad∣mirable Perfection; and they having received from the unknown Author of this Essay such Recommendatory Arguments in elation to both Church and State, which in due time, (if those Considerations shall meet with Encouragement by Your Honours Approbation) may be made Publick, such as they think sufficient to Evidence not only the Truth, but the indispensable Necessity of the Undertaking; some few of which they do in all Humility propose to Your Honours Consideration.
First, whether it be not the only way to establish our Nations Peace and Happiness, to follow our Saviour's Advice; and first seek the Kingdom of Heaven, that all things else may be Added; and since this must first be done; Whether we can reasonably ex∣pect the good things that are necessary to establish our Nations happy Tranquility, whilst this Kingdom is sought for? 2dly, Whether this seeking don't consist in Repentance and Amend∣ment of the Nation in General, as well as your particular selves? 3dly, Whether any more effectual Methods can be taken to answer His Majesty's most Gracious Desires to have all manner of Vice suppresed, than by preventing the Retailing Strong-Drinks of all sorts in our Nation; and whether this Project be not as pra∣cticable as indispensably necessary, upon those Considerations? 1. Whether it be a right Notion in Politicks to set such extra∣ordinary Taxes upon Luxury, because such vast Summs are daily consumed in Wine, Ale, Tobacco, and Coffee in the Re∣spective Houses that Retail the same? 2ly, How detrimental it must needs be for any Nation to de∣stroy so much of its Stock to so little purpose; and whether our Men, Money, and Manufactures that are exchang'd for those Tri∣fles, be not so much Treasure given for that which makes us as in∣sensably Poor, as excessive Wicked? 3ly, Whether if all this Wealth were husbanded and employ∣ed in some other Traffick of Real use, a much greater Revenue might not be raised to the Crown without oppressing any Person, because what doth arise from those Commodities is very small, in consi∣deration of the Value we give them, tho' we destroy them wast∣fully so soon as they are at the greatest Price? 4ly, Whether if the Retailing of Strong-Drinks were prevent∣ed, Persons of Quality, Gentlemen, and all Persons that can now afford to buy them of the Retailers, may not Drink them much Cheaper in their own Houses, where 'tis impossible so much Debauchery and Lewdness should be acted and encouraged, as in Retailing Houses it is, and ever will be? 5ly, Whether if these Nurseries of Vice, Faction, Dissention and Idleness were suppressed, all Persons would not spare time to frequent the daily Of∣fices of the Church, by which our Spiritual guides would be more edifying to themselves and others? 6ly, Whether these Retailing Houses has not deprived more Worthy Pa∣rents of their just hopes in being happy in their Children than Death it self? 7ly, Whether Masters of all Ranks might not have their Buisiness better
done, and with more security from being defrauded by their Servants, if they depended upon their Masters good Pleasure, for all the Strong-Drink they drank? 8ly, Whether Tradesmen in general do beleive that the Ale. House Custom was ever profitable to them, and whether from 10 to 100 l. that's spent, once, twice, and in some great Towns thrice a Week, on Market-days in a Ta∣vern, Ale, or Coffee-house, in consuming those Trifles extravagantly, would not be better laid out in our Manufactures in their Shops? 9ly, Whether it be not the Interest of England, to have Rents low, because all things will fall in proportion, and then we shall Work our Manufactures Cheap and be able to undersell our Neighbours in all Places, which is the only way to preserve our Commerce abroad, which at this time all Nations are Ravishing from us; nor can the Nobility and Gentry suffer by it either in Honour or Estate, by reason of the proportionate fall of all other Commodiis 10ly, Whether if no Strong-Drink were to be sold by Retail, an Army of 30 or 40 thousand Men might not be kept on Foot, Paid, be pro not grieviance but a security to our Nation: If occasion be? And he Poor∣est People that sead nothing will find their Poe returned doube in their accounts at te years end by the Cheapness of Corn.11ly, Let it be supposed that every Man spends but 2d per die ∣gantly? If this were prevented, Whether each Person would not be able to pay 2d per Week to the King, which would double the quarterly Pole, and no Person oppressed by it? And lastly, since Reformation is so highly necessary, so much talkt of, yet so little advanc'd, with all the industry of the several Societies for putting the Laws in Execution against offenders, it seems altogether necessary to find some other effectual way to put a stop to the Licensiousness of the Age, whereby the inpending Wrath of Heaven may be averted, by reclaiming the People of this Nation from their continual provoaking the Almighty to send his Judgments amongst us; and if by putting this Project in execution (with∣out which nothing but a miracle can do it) some inconvenience should hap∣pen at first to particular Persons, it may be considered that only such will suffer whose Temporal welfare consists in the eternal Ruin of our Nation; as 'tis made Apparent in a Treatise that's ready for the Press, if these conside∣rations meet with the desired effect; and if any Person or Society has any thing to object against what has been said, the Members of this Society will return them humble Thanks for giving them Advertisement in some of the publick Prints, provided always they don't advance a Temporal concern before an Eternal: for as those things are incompatible, they will make no reply, but to such as prefer things Eternal before things Transitory, for they have higher Aims than Revenge or Applause, and Act by a more Elevated Policy, than that of being known; they require from Mankind a greater success than either Reward or Commendation, 'tis Reformation and A∣mendment they expect. ☞ If these Considerations meet with the desired Effect, the SOCIETY will make it manifest that two Millions may be raised Anually, and four saved o the Nation, without oppressing any People. FINIS.
POSTSCRIPT. THE SOCIETY are very willing to adhere to His MAJESTY's Observations, That the Increase of the POOR are become a Burden to the Kingdom; their Loose and ill Life contributing to the Depravation of Manners complain'd of. Now, whether any thing contributes so much to a Loose and ill Life through the whole Kingdom, as Taverns and Ale-Houses, and all such Receptacles of Unimploy'd People? Let every man Consider, and speak his Mind without Prejudice or Heat. For as this SOCIETY have no Sinister Designs of their own; so they have no Envidious Peak against any the most dissolute Managers of Retailing-Houses, no farther than what may tend to their own Eternal as well as Temporal Welfare: Therefore they desire that all such as are Concern'd to Sup∣press this Undertaking, upon account of either Interest or Convenience, will first seriously Consider and weigh the Mo∣tives inducing to the Project, and the present Circumstances of the Kingdom; and how necessary it is to Employ some part of the Money that is so unreasonably Spent in the King∣dom to such Uses as His Majesty mentions; and whether the Means proposed be not the only way to make it Sufferable and Acceptable to all Capacities. or i  also be Consi∣dered, that if good Small-Beer, good Beef, Mutton, and o∣ther Viands be not wanting, no Person can Suffer, be he ne∣ver so far from home; and the poorest will be able to pur∣chase so much as he has Occasion for, without hazarding ei∣ther his Time, Health, or any thing else that's truly Valuable; and tho' as it is not expected that this can be effected in a Moment; yet by making Men sensible of how small Use the Retailing STRONG DRINK is to the Real behoof of Man∣kind, they will easily part with such an imaginary Good, for a Real one; which is, Dear Countrymen, the most hearty Desire of Your most loving Friends.
