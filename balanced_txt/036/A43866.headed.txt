HIS MAIESTIES Passing through the Scots Army. GEnerall Lasley being aduertised of the time of his Majesties com∣ming to New-castle, that hee might as well appeare in his own art and luster as in his dutie and loialty to his Soueraigne (hauing first made his choyce of fitt ground) hee drew out his whole forces both horse and foot with the Artillerie and the better to expresse the souldiers salute and welcome of their King, hee rallied his men into two diuisions of equall number ranging them in a great length with an equall distance betweene them of about eight score which rendred them the more conspicuous and with the braver aspect to the beholders, through these the King was to passe, whither being come the Generall alighing from his horse
(which was presently taken by two of his foot∣men) Hee prostrated himselfe and service be∣fore the King upon his knees, his Majestie a while priuately talking to him and at his rising gave him his hand to kisse, and commanded his horse to be giuen him, whereon remounted, he ridd with the King through the Armie. In the first place stood Hghlanders com∣monly called Redshankes, with their plaines cast ouer their shoulders hauing euery one his bowe and arrowes with a broad slycing sword by his syde, these are so good markes-men that they will kill a deere in his speed, it being the cheifest part of their liuing, selling the skinns by great quantities and feeding on the flesh, next were Musketeers interlac't with Pikes and here and there intermixt with those dangerous short gunnes inuented by that their famous engineer Sandy Hamilton and were for the sudden execution of horse in case they should assaile them, then againe bowes mus∣kets and pikes for a good distance on both sides, in the mid-way the Artillery was placed by Tiers consisting of about 60. peices of Ordnance, the cannoniers standing in readines with fired linstockes in their hands, the hors∣men were here placed on both sides which serued as wings or flankes for the whole Army and so forward in the same order, but disposed into so goodly a presence and posture, with
such sutable equipage and millitarie accom∣modations that they appeared ready to give or take battaile, or Forth with to have gone up∣on some notable designe. And as the King passed a long they gave such true fyre as it is beleeued since the inuention of gunnes neuer better was seene or heard, they discharged wondrous swift but with as good a method and order as your skilfullest Ringers observe with Bels, not suffering the noyse of the one to drowne the other, the King receiued such con∣tentment that whereas his dinner was appoin∣ted and prouided at the Maiors of New-castle, hee yet went and honoured Generall Lasley with his presence at dinner, who hath not on∣ly gained a good report with his Majeie to be a brave Souldier but also a singular esteeme to be a most expert and able commander and ge∣nerall by such ofour English Officers as were then with his Majestie
THE Manner of the Scots departure, and marching out of New-Castle. THe Scots when they marched out of Newcastle their Artillerie be∣ing mounted vpon their carriages, aduanced first forth with the Cannoniers and other Officers thereto belonging and some troops of horse, then most of the Regiments of foot, after them their prouision baggage and carriage, then fol∣lowed the rest of the foot, and all the rest ta∣king their leaves in a most brotherly and friendly manner, being gone some foure miles from the Towne their generall hauing directed them to march forwards he returned to New∣castle accompanied with some few of his of∣ficers, causing the Toll Bell to bee rung vp and downe the Towne proclaming that if any of the Towne were not yet satisfied for any thing due to them from any of his Officers or soul∣diers,
let them bring in their Tickets and hee would pay them, which hee did accordingly to the great content of the Townes-men, and much applause of the Generall and his whole Armie, and after a solemne taking of his leave he followed the Armie going all the way along with them in the Reere as they marched and not any thing taken from any man in all their Iourney to their singular Commendation and gayning the good esteeme of all that passed by. FINIS.
