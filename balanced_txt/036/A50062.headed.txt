TO THE Right Reverend JAMES USHER Arch-Bishop of Armagh. HONOURED SIR, BOth the Subject I handle, and my own special Obligation are a just Apologie for my Dedication of this Treatise unto you. I treat of Religion and Learning, a no∣ble Argument, and (were it an∣swerably handled) well-worthy of so noble a Patro∣nage. Learning is the great Ornament of a man, and true Religion (which is an honouring of God suitably to his Excellency) is the great Ornament of a Christian. Where there is a happy conjunction of a learned Head, and a sincere and truly religious Heart, there is a Person every way accomplisht. Bi∣shop Juell is frequently for this reason styled, The Jewell of Bishops; and of Dr Raynolds it is said, Incertum est fuerit doctior an melior.
Dr Rivet and Peter du Moulin, two French Divines are famous for their eminent Piety, learned Writings, and fifty years preaching. Your Name is also precious in all the Reformed Churches, witness the Dedication of divers learnedDe Dieu in Acta Apost. Apahm. Dub. Evang. parte 2da Bootii Ani∣madver. Sac. Mori Cal∣vinus.

Your sending to Samaria for several Copies of the Samaritane Pentateuch, bringing them first into Europe, and dispersing them many wayes, and also your purchasing at a dear rate the Syriack-Bible, and many other Syriack-Books from Syria, and your free imparting them to such Schollers as were skilfull in that Language, is deser∣vedly celebrated by Mr Selden in his Preface ad Marmora Arundeliana, De Dieu in his Epi∣stle Dedicatory to the Acts, and Dr Boot in his Index Autorum before his Animadversiones Sa∣crae. Your Liberality to such as are in a necessitous condition, is also well known▪ It is a usual Maxim or Proverb, That the greatest Schollers are not the best Preachers; and Queen Elizabeth was wont to say, That she had made a Bishop, and marr'd a Preacher. You have really confuted both these, by your plan and powerfull Preaching, and by your constant labouring (for above fifty years) in that
sacred Function, even after the time, that through  naturall decay you were unable to reade your Text. Therein well fullfilling your Motto, both in  Episcopall and Archiepiscopall Seal, Vae mih  non Evangelizavero. Could your leisure have permitted you to have heard me reade this whole Work to you, as you did vouchsafe me the favour, to hear part of it, it might have been more exact in it self, and so more worthy your Countenance You were pleased to com∣mend to me some of the Authous I made use of, and to supply me also with some choice Books out of your well-furnisht Library; some of the Observations also I was beholding to you for, to you (I say) who are , a breathing Library,Eun ipius de Longino in Porphyr. p. 12. and walking Study. This, with what I before alleadged, may justifie this honouring of my Book with your Name, the Dedication of it to you be∣ing as proper, as that of Tullies Book De senectute ad senem; or that of Hermannus Hugo De ori∣gine foribendi ad Scribanium. The Argument also is seasonable for these tims, wherein Learning hath other enemies besides the ignorant, if a Gover∣nour of a Colledge in the University, may not goe for an Ignaro also; and wherein the vitals of Religion are in so much danger, partly by Scepticisme of the one side, and questioning almost all the great Articles of Christian Faith, and by Libertinisme on the other side, as if the Primitive Christians, Martyrs, and old Puritans, had been more precise then wise. It is your honour therefore in such a declining Age, when others dispute away Truths and Duties, to stand for
Orthodox Truths, and practise holy Duties. Psal. 119. 126, 127. Old-age (saith Salomon) is a Crown when it is found in the way of Righteousness. As God hath inriched you with large Abilities, so lay them out still for the good of the Church, that so you may prove a happy instrument whilst you live of Gods Glo∣ry, which is the desire of SIR Your most Affectionate Friend and Servant EDWARD LEIGH.
To the Judicious and Candid READER. READER, WHen I first pitcht my thoughts upon this Subject, I in∣tended only to give some brief Character of some Humanists, and some of the chief reformed Writers, but in the prosecution of my Design, meeting with divers Elogies and apt descriptions of some of the chief Popish Writers, I thought it not amiss to make the Work more general. A learned Divine inquired of me, when my Body of Divinity was coming forth, Whether I treated there of Religion, seeming to wonder, that many who publish∣ed Systemes of Divinity, said nothing of so usefull a Subject, whereabout also many Questions might be raised and discussed. I thereupon bethink∣ing with my self, that I might conveniently treat of it in this Book, accordingly made Religion and Learning the Argument of the two first Books, and those that were eminently Religious or Learned, are mentio∣ned according to the order of the Alphabet in the four following Books. But I take liberty therein by reason of the Alphabetical order, and be∣cause I could not so properly refer them to the second Book, to speak of several Bibles, Councels, Confessions, Proverbs, and the Talmud, in the letter of the Alphabet, whereto they belong, the knowledge thereof being helpfull to Schollers. Besides, where I speak of Charles the Great and the fifth, I also mention Charles the ninth, both because I met with an excellent Character of him in Thuanus, and also because he was a spe∣cial instance of Gods retaliating Justice, for shedding the bloud of Pro∣testants in the Parisian Massacre. I may perhaps also mention an Heretick that was not famous either for Learning or Piety. I thought good to ad∣vertise the Reader hereof, lest he should wonder else when he meets with these particulars. The first Book is concerning Religion, that it is, what it is, its Antiquity, the true and false Religions, the Reformed Religion, and some Questions about Religion are also discussed. The second Book is concerning Learning, its Excellentcy, Usefulness, of the Liberal Arts, the Languages, Universities. In the four last Books, my intention was to speak of such as were Zealous for the true Religion, or eminent for Learning, either as general Schollers, or peculiarly learned in any kinde.
As the Argument is double, Religion and Learning, and the persons double, Religious and Learned, so I should be glad, if it might conduce any way to the advancing of the esteem at least of the true Religion and Learning, to the setling of men in the true Religion, and incouraging of them in all good Literature. You have here a Catalogue of the famous Witnesses of Christ against Antichrist, of the Champions for Truth, the glorious Reformers and blessed Martyrs, to win you to the liking of, and constancy in the true Religion. You have also here a roll of the famous Linguists and Artists, the learned Lawyers, Physicians, Divines, anci∣ent and modern, Protestants and Papists, the learned Poets, Philoso∣phers, Historiographers, Orators, learned men and women, to allure you to a good opinion at least of Learning, as that which is so many wayes usefull both to Civil and Christian societies. I might here expatiate in the just praises of England, for the purity of its Doctrine in Religion, and also for the many learned AuthorsSee Burtons Melancholy▪ part. 1. Memb. 3 sub Sect. 15.

As the Separation made by our first Reformers was most just for the Idolatry and Cruelty of the Romish Church, Revel. 17. 5, 6. not∣withstanding the great charge of Schism against us by the Romanists, so the English have since the first Reformation here happily begun in the Reign of that pious Prince Edward the sixth, and sealed with the bloud of many holy Martyrs in the dayes of Queen Mary, maintained and countenanced that pure Religion which may fitly be called their Palla∣dium. England is celebrated abroad by the name of the ringing Island, and it may justly ascribe the great fertility and plenty of outward bles∣sings it enjoyes, to the free entertainment it hath given to the Gospel, and the true Professours of it. But let us take heed of imitating Hol∣land too much in an Universal Toleration of all Religions, shall, I say, or opinions, least what Baudius applies to them, agree too fitly to us, Sed vivimus hic non solum in regno libertatis verum etiam licentiae.

To that I answer, Some of those Latine Authors, which write of il∣lustrious men, speak of divers that were then living. 2. Those that are well acquainted with my temper, will not, I suppose, much charge me with adulation, and the ordinary way of honourably mentioning Authors in quotations little differs from this. I hope what I say in that kinde will incourage and not puff up any. As I may through mistake insert some here, who perhaps were nei∣ther eminent for Religion nor Learning, so I hope no man will imagine that I take upon me to give so compleat an enumeration, as to omit none, that were too difficult a Province for me to undertake, if the most here be such as will agree with the running Title, I hope none will inter∣prete it exclusively, as if these alone were such. I have cause to bless God that this Subject is profitable, as those others I have formerly la∣boured in, and hope, that as they have been generally well-esteemed of (for who can expect to please all?) so this likewise will be favourably entertained by those that are candid and judicious, which is the de∣sire of Thy Affectionate Friend EDWARD LEIGH.

A TREATISE OF RELIGION AND Learning. BOOK I. OF RELIGION. CHAP. I. Of Religion in general. RELIGION is the chief thing which distinguisheth a man from a beast; the Elephant and some bruits have a shadow of rea∣son, but Religion is peculiar to men, or reasonable creatures at least; therefore Gesner (as I remember) saith, the Pigmies are a kinde of Apes, and not men, because they have no Religion. I Shall in the entrance to this Work shew 1. That Religion is. 2. What Religion is. 1. That it is. Some of the Arguments which prove that there is a God, prove also that there is Religion, for Religion gives God that honour and homage that is due unto him. The working of Conscience proves that there is a God, and it also proves a Religion. The knowledge and sense of sinne is in all mens hearts; the Heathens had their turpia & honesta; a great part of Religion lies in a kindly fear of sinne, and the feare of punishment after sinne proves it also, that there is some Religion. 2. The flying to refuge in troubles, and the praying also in straights, Ion. 3. 6. is a proof that there is a God, and also that there is a Religion. 3. It bath been the practise of all people ever since the world was, to use some re∣ligious Rites. Abel sacrificed, See Gen. 4. ult. The most ancient Heathen Histories men∣tion their Religion. Plùtarch saith, the first care their Lawgivers had, was about their Gods and their Worship. So all Nations acknowledge that there is a God, and there∣fore
to be worshipped. Religion is the glory and excellency of Angels, in that they adore him that is better then themselves: it was the excellency of Adam in Pa∣radise, being the effect of the Image of God upon the soul. The Jews were once the only Nation whom God honoured, by intrusting them with his Oracles, Rom. 9. 4. compared with c. 3. v. 2. The imbracing, maintaining and practising of the true Re∣ligion, is the onely way to make a Nation or Person strong and peaceable, 2 Chron. 11. 16, 17. prosperous and plentifull in all outward blessings, 2 Chron. 11. 5, 12. 2 Sam. 6. 12. For those that honour God he will honour, and those that despise him shall be lightly esteemed, 1 Sam. 1. 30. 2. What Religion is. Of the word. The Hebrew word comes from a verb which signifieth to serve or worship, seeReligio Hebraeis vocatur  Exod. 22. 26. venit autem à verbo  quod est servire & colere.  Graeci vocant, ut Act. 26. 35. Haee vox à verbo derivatur, quod servire significat & colere. Aug. Tom. 1. lib. de vera religione, religionem à religando deducit, quod cultu Dei animas nostras religemus Deo à quo defe∣cerimus. Ac Tom. 5. de Civit Dei, l. 10. c. 4. à reeligendo derivat, quòd hac Deum, quem amiseramus, negligentes, denuò religimus, seu reeligimus. Zanch. Tom. 4. l. 1. de Religione. c. 13. Qui omnia, quae ad cultum Deoru pertinerent, dili∣genter pertractarent, & tanquam religerent, sunt dicti religiosi, ait M. Tullius. Atque hanc sententiam sequutus est Arnobius l. 4. adversus Gentes. Meli tamen ejus discipulus Lactntius, religionem à religando applltam existimavit. Herald. Animadvers. ad Arnob. l. 4. Religsi ici videntur, quontam, quae a cultum divinum pertinent diligenter pertra∣ctent & quasi relegant. Isid. l. 10 Etyml. c. 17. Alii putant Religiom dium esse  relinquendo, eo quod propter sanctita∣tem aliquam sepositum fit, & à nostris ib motum id quod est religiosè consecratum. Azor. Institut. moral. l. 9. c. 10. Iames 1. ult: for Religion, the Syriack interpreter hath a word which signifies ser∣vice, worship. Austin and Lactantius derive the Latine word à religando: it is the great bond to tie us to God and to man. Others à reeligendo, or à relegendo, be∣cause by the often reading and choice of holy books Religion is learned. Religion is either true or false. The true Religion is that whereby we serve the true God and with true worship. False religion is either that, whereby either we serve the false god, as the RomanesRomani. in times past, or whereby we serve the true God with false worship, as the present Romanes.Romanenses. Superstitio est, ubi aut falsi dii, aut falso & inani cultu co∣litur Deus: con∣tra religio, ubi verus Deus v∣roque cultu co∣litur. Impietas verò est, ubi nulla prorsus est religio, & tales homines propriè impii vocantur, qualis fuit Diagoras, qui  dictus est. Zanch. Tom. 4. l. 1. De Reli∣gione, c. 13. Idem sunt reipla verus Dei cultus, & vera religio, sicut contra falsus & impius cultus idem est atque supersti∣tio, falsaque religio, Zanch. Tom 4. l. 1. De Religione, c. 13. 1. Religio accipitur pro ratione seu modo colendi Deum, vel pro orma cultus exerni & publici qui Deo exhibetur, five rectè, five perperam. 2. Pro virtute qua Deum rectè agnosci∣mus, & sanctè ac purè col juxta normam in verbo Dei praescriptam seu pro interna & fincera animi pietate à qua dicimur religiosi▪ Ravanella. Religion may be thus defined. It is an officious action, debt, duty, worship or service, inward and outward, which God requireth and man is bound to perform according to his will, by vertue of that bond whereby he is tied to God. True Religion is the true service of the true God. Morn. de verit. Christ. relig. cap. 24. One saith, True Religion is the right performance of those duties which we owe to the one onely true God.

Amyrald. de Secess. b Ecclesia Romana. p. 106. It was in the beginning of the world. We reade of Sacrifices offered by Cain and Abel; and likewise the distinction of clean and unclean beasts. The Christian Religion is now of some standing. There are resemblances of all the gifts of man in the Beasts, but none of Religion, this is the chiefest perfection of man. Azoriu saith, Religion is a Morall and not a Theological vertue, for God is not the object of it, but the honour and worship of God, which Religion gives to the divine Majesty. Rules to know the true Religion, False Religions love obscurity, but the true Religion setteth forth her doctrine
to view; The Mahumetans, Turks, and Persians have their service in the ArabickReligio est quae Deo de∣bitum cultum affert. Aquim 2d• 2d•. qu. 81. Artic. c. 5. Conclus.

The Jews reade in their Synagogues▪ the Law and the Prophets in the Hebrew tongue, whereas the most part of their people have but little or no understanding thereof. The Papists have the Scriptures and their Liturgie in Latine. 2. False Religion is loose, but the true Religion requires strict and holy walking, Iames 1. 26, 27. Ea Religio praeferenda quae favet puritati & sanctitati vitae. Lessius. Fornication was scarce a sinne among the Heathens; Mahomet was dissolute him∣self, and allowed his Disciples to be sensuall; The Jews practise Usurie; Abominable uncleannesse is permitted and practised at Rome. 3. The Scripture is the only rule to judge of true and false Religions, Deut 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 Thes. 5. 21. 1 Ioh. 4. 1, 2. The marks of the true Religion laid down by Walaeus are; 1. The true know∣ledgeAnimadverten∣dum est prium Decalogi prae∣ceptum unum cole Deum ad Religionem per∣tinere, cujus est justum ac debi∣tum Deo cultum deferre. of the true God. 2. A true way of reconcili man with God. 3. True wor∣ship of God. Zanchy layes down these Theses. 1. True Religion (which is the same with piety) consists in the true worship of God, both externall and internall, but especially in the internall. 2. True Religion knowes and worships onely one God, Exod. 20. 3. God will have no companion in his majesty and worship. The wisest Philosophers and best Poets among the Gentiles, thought the same; as both Iustin Martyr and Clemens Alex∣andrinus,Azor. Iustitut. Moral. l. 9 c. 10. Lactantiu one of the most eloquent of the Latine Fa∣thers hath written grave∣ly both of the true and false Religion. The Divin authority of the Christian Doctrine con∣firmed. and other Fathers have abundantly demonstrated. 3. The true Religion worships God with no other worship then that which he hath prescribed, viz. with true piety of minde. Externall Rites, Ceremonies, Sacrifices (which also are called worship) in the Scri∣pture, are onely exercises of inward piety, and therefore are so farre acceptable to God as they proceed from inward piety. Christian Religion was planted by the power of God: As it appears, 1. By its speedy propagation, Rom. 1. 8. Col. 1. 6. 1 Ioh. 5. 4. 2. All these things were foretold long since by the Sybils and Prophets. 3. From the nature of the Doctrine of Christ, the efficacy of his Doctrine, and the authority of the Teacher: What Doctrine did Christ and his Apostles use to per∣swade their hearers? Give to the poor, Give your cheeks to the smiter, Do good to your enemies, Deny your selves, Take up your Crosse, You must look for many afflictions and persecutions if you follow us. O suasionem diffuasionis omnis undique plenam, saith Facinus. Yet Christ perswaded suddenly many and great men; and the reason is given Mark. 1. 22. Christ taught with authority, not as the Scribes and Pharises. 4. From the sublimitie and symphonieHabent scrip∣tores illi nescio, quid pium & Augustum, at∣que id quod mi∣rabile est, inter se quidem com∣mune à caeteris omnibus penitu alienum, quod significat omni∣bus illis Deum prae caetrris spi∣rasse.

The purity of this Doctrine and the amplitude of the Promises. These reasons and more are alledged by Marsilius Ficinus in his 8th and 35 Cha∣pters of his excellent book De religione Christiana. The glory of a Religion lies in three things, 1. The excellency of Rewards. 2. The purity of the Precepts.
3. The sureness of the principles of trust. Let us examine the Christian Religion by these things, and see if it can be match∣ed elsewhere. 1. The reward is the eternall injoyment of God in Christ, Psal. 6. 11. 2 Cor. 4.Neque terrena praemia, ut leges aliae, sed caelestia pollicetur. Ficin. de Relig. Christ. cap 8. The glory of Religion hath been to have holy Martyrs and infamous Persecutors. Iustinus Philosophus & Martyr, de conversione sua, transituque ab Ethnicismo verba faciens, ingenue fatetur, se Platonic sectae addictum, cum Christianos velut de plaustro omni conviciorum genere proscindi, & tamen impavidos omnium aetatum dignitatumque homines ad mortem accedere animadverteret, cogitare caepisse, fieri non posse, ut ejusmodi homines improbi voluptatibus dediti vitae hujus amantes jure habeantur, qui etiam cum dignitate vivendi conditione sibi oblata, mori malut, quum Christum abnegare. Nullum enim tale praesidium è Platonis Philosophia morti opponi posse, vir prudens & ingeniosua facile colligebat. Jac. Gryn. Epist l. 1. Epist. 41. Vide plura ibid. 16. Heb. 11. 6. 2. The purity of precepts: Our holy Religion doth not only forbid sins, but lusts, Psal. 19. 9. 1 Pet. 2. 21. The Law of God reacheth not only to the act, but to the aim and intention in duties. 3. The sureness of the principles of trust, Psal. 19. 7. Psal. 93. 5. they are called The sure mercies of David, Heb. 12. 28. No other Religion but the Christian shews the way to salvation, nor gives assu∣rance of salvation; nor no people but Christians have assurance. Means to keep us constant in the Truth of Religion. 1. We should ground our selves well in the knowledge of it, 2 Tim. 3. 14. Col. 1. 23. For which end, 1. Acquaint thy self well with the main principles of Religion, this is the foun∣dation, Heb. 6. 1. 2. Receive nothing in Religion upon the credit of any man, Acts 17. 11. 1 Thess. 5. 21. 2. Love and practise that thou knowest, Psal. 86. 11. & 119. 3. Luke 8. 15. 3. Take heed of declining from or forsaking the least truth, Psal. 119. 127, 128. 4. Be constant in a conscionable use of all Gods holy Ordinances, 1. The Mi∣nistry of the Word, Ephes. 4. 14. Heb. 10. 23, 25. 2. The Sacrament of the Lords Supper, it is the Sacrament of our nourishing and strengthening in the State of Grace, and Christ therein is received as bread, the use whereof is, to strengthen mans heart, Psal. 104. 15. 3.

(said they) they passed to a new superstition, and forsook the worship of the Gods; whence also they collected, that all the evils which infested men were sent by the angry Gods, and therefore they ascribed to them the calamities of the world: To whom Tertullian well answered, That many of those calamities upon Cities and Islands happened before Christs coming. Whether men may be saved in any Religion? The Socinians say a man of any perswasion may be saved, if he doth not walk contrary to his light. The Scripture speaks but of one faith, Ephes. 4. 5. and that also the Nations should be brought to God by this Gospel, Matth. 24. 14. None can be saved with∣out Christ, 1 Cor. 3. 11. There is no other foundation of hope and comfort, no other name under heaven, Act. 4. 12. I am the way, Joh. 14. 6.
CHAP. II. Of the chief False Religions. THere are many false Religions, but the principall are these four.Infideles omnes populi appellan∣tur in libris ve∣teris testament Goiim, & inde in Apostolicis li∣bris, & Evan∣gelistarum mo∣numentis vn nempe, quia praeter populum Deo peculiarem Iudeae terminis inclusum, & postea prater paucos fideles, gentes omnes aliae & nationes vero Déo igno∣rato Idolis ser∣viebant.

Nec dubito quin haec vera appellationis ratio fuerit, non quod eruditi homines excogitarint, videntur ea omnia (quod eruditissimorum hominum pace dixerim) à rei veritate paulo logi abesse. Herald. Animadvers. ad Arnob. l 1. p. 3, & 4. Vide Voet. Disput. Theol. part. 2. de Gentilismo. Paganism. Mahometism. Judaism. Popery. First, Paganism. The Heathen are of Christians called Pagani, because the people who lived in Country Villages (which are properly called Pagani, a Pago, and that of , as Pomp. Festus saith, Quia eadem aqua uterentur) remained for the most part Hea∣thenish, after the Cities generally were converted to Christianity. B. Down. De∣fence of his Sermon, l. 2. ch. 7. The Apostles first preached in great Cities, where Religion by Gods blessing upon their labours did first take place, which was a cause why the name of Pagans (which properly signifieth Country-people) came to be used in common speech for the same that Infidels and unbelievers were. There is Infidelitas negativa, or purae negationis, as in Pagans and Turks, to whom God never yet vouchsafed the means of grace. 2. Pravae dispositionis, by which one refuseth to believe, Isa. 7 9. 2 Thess. 2. 10. The condition of the Pagans or Heathens is excellently described, Ephes. 2. 12. At that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the Covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. The Scripture still brands the Heathens, Ier. 10. 25. Matth. 6. 32. 1 Pet. 4. 3. the Heathens and Publicans are joyned together. They knew that there was a God, Rom. 1. 18, 19. & 2. 14. and the wisest ofNon est quaestio de gentilibus ad Ecclesiam Isra∣eliticam congre∣gratis, an illi sa∣lutis participes facti fuerint, sed de gentilibus ex∣tra Ecclesiam. 2.

Gerh. Confess. Cathol. lib. 2. Special. Artic. 2. c. 4. Vide plura ibid. them worshipped the true God, Act. 17. 23. but 1. Their knowledge was imper∣fect and confused. 2. Languishing and fainting, mixed with many doubts, Ari∣stotle and Plato the wisest of them doubted about God, and the immortality of the soul. 3. They had no knowledge of Christ and the Trinity of persons. No man can come to the Father but by me, he is called the Way, Joh. 5. 23. & 17. 3. 1 Iohn 2. 23. & 5. 11, 12. Act. 4. 12. Secondly, For their life and conversation, they had no true piety in them. 1. Because they had not faith, which only purifieth the heart, Rom. 10. 17. 2. They were not renewed or converted, every one must be regenerated, a new creature. 3. They had not a right end in what they did. 4. All their morality was defiled with idolatry, Rom. 1. 23, 25. They became vain in their imaginations, v. 21. The Stoicks were the strictest Sect of all the Philosophers, yet there was a great difference between their discipline and the discipline of Christians; they command∣ed to give to the needy, but forbad to be moved with pity, because pity is a passi∣on which a wise man should be free from: but that is a strange wisdom which
takes away all humanity, that is Philanthropy, by which name the Grecians call pity. Therefore their state before the Gospel cometh to them, must needs be wofull and damnable. Luretius Carus the Philosopher and Poet, inveighing sore against the super∣stitious Religion of the Gentiles, and recounting the wicked fact of King Aga∣memnon in sacrificing his only daughter Iphigenia, being a young damsell of excel∣lent beauty, to the intent to please the wrathfull gods, hinderers of his navigation, after he had said all, closed it up in this one verse, spoken in Epiphonema. Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum. They shall be judged by the Law of nature, they having never heard of Christ nor his word, shall not be punished for not beleeving such things. The Heathens were Polytheists, worshippers of many Gods. The Pantheon at Rome was built by Domitian the Emperour Anno gratae 85. that is, a Temple for the honour of all the Gods; or rather devils, Eo quod inMatth. Westm. Flor. Hist. p. 55. Id. ibid. p. 109. eodem quondam omnium non Deorum, sed damonum cultus agebatur. The Scripture frequently cals such Idol-worship the worship of devils. They generally worshipt the Sun, as Macrobis and others shew.Persae & magi ones, qui Per∣i regionis in∣colunt fines, ig∣nem prferunt, & omnibus elementis pu∣tant debere praeponi, Jul. irmic.

Walaeus in his answer to Corvinus, c. 5. alledgeth Rom. 3. 11. & Psal. 14. 3. and saith, that experience gives testimony to this assertion of the Scripture, for there was never any found amongst those Nations, to whom the Gospel was not preached, who drew the knowledge of Christ from the light of nature, or to whom God miraculously revealed Christ for his improving the Law of Nature. Cornelius lived at Caesarea, with the Jews. Iob was of the posterity of Abraham, he instructed his posterity, Gen. 18. 19. nay God often passed by those who most improved the light of nature, and revealed Christ by the Gospel to those who were more wicked and perverse then they, Deut. 32. 28. Ezek. 3. 16. & 5. 6. Matth. 11. 21. not to So∣crates, Plato, Aristides, Cato, laudatissima inter Gentiles nomina, but to more wicked. But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto theSed patibulo affixus interiit. Quid istud ad causam? Neque enim qualitas & deformits mortis dicta ejus immutat aut fact a, aut co minor videbitur disciplinarum ejus auctoritas, quia vinculis corporis non naturali dissolutione di∣gressus est, sed vi illata decessit. Pythagoras Samis suspicion dominationis injusta vivus concrematus in fano est▪ numqui ea quae docuit, vim propriam perdiderunt, quiae non spiritum spoute, sed crudelitate appetitu effudit?

Arnob. Advers. Gent. l. 1. Greeks foolishness, 1 Cor. 1. 23. The Jews mock us, because we had such a Messiah which cried out, My God, my God, why hast thou saken me? If he was God (say they) why did he so cry out? did not all troubles come to him by his own will? Wisdom is justified of her children. We have those famous Apologies of Iustin Martyr, who dedicated his first toAnno Aerae Christi 303.

He is styled by Pierius Valerianus, Acerrimus Christiani nominis propugnator. The wiser Heathens did call the Christians Idiots, and reproached them as il∣literate. But the Atheist cannot name any age wherein the Heathen had an Oliver to oppugne our Christian profession, but we had a Rowland to defend it. If they had a Porphrie or Celsus to oppose Philosophy against it, we had an Arnobius, an Origen to maintain and follow Christianity. If they had a Symmachus, we had an
Ambrose and Prudentius: If they had a Iulian, we had a Gregory Nazianzon. Those Atlasses of Christian Religion equalled the most renowned Heathens in all Learning (as well as they exceeded them in true Religion:) Such among others were Iustin a Philosopher and Martyr, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Cyprian, Origen, (Learned to a miracle) Clement of Alexandria, Eusebius, Epiphanius, the three Learned Gregories, Nazianzene, Nyssene, Thaumaturgus, both the Basils, Atha∣nasius, Cyrill, Minutius Faelix, Arnobius, Chrysostom, Ierom, Ambrose, La∣ctantius, Austin, Prosper, Hilary, Prudentius, and others, of most eminent Learn∣ing, piety and courage, who defended the Christian Religion against proud Hea∣thens and pestilent Hereticks of those daies.

The second great false Religion is Mahometism.Vide Laurentii Ludovici Leo∣bergensis Orat. 10, & 11. De Muhom. in∣crement. & Forbes Instruct. Histor.

IN the Year of our Lord 666, the detestable Sect of Mahumet began to take strength and place. Moamed or Machumed an Ishmaelite being a poor man till he married a widow wealthy and of high countenance: having the falling sickness, where∣by the widow was sorry that she matched with him, perswaded her by himself and others, that his fits were but a trance, wherein he talked with the Angel Gabriel. The woman made women beleeve that her husband was a Prophet: afterwards men by help of certain Heretiques set the false Prophet forward. From Iudaism Arius, Nstorius, and his own brain he frameth a Doctrine. He prevaileth so by force of his wilde company and guile deceiving the simple, that before his death he winneth Arabia, and the Countries about Euphrates. The sonnes of Ishmael ashamed of Agars name, borrow from Sara the term of Saracens. Brought. Concent. He gave sundry Laws to his followers, patched of many Sects and Religions to∣gether: He taught them to pray ever to the South, and as we keep the Sunday, so they keep the Friday, which they call the day of Venus. He permitted them to have as many Wives as they were able to maintain; to have as many ConcubinesMahomet was born in the Country of Arabia. His Father was a Persian, his mother an Ishmaelite, which Ishmaelites being a people of Arabia, were called then Agarns, which term Mabumet afterward turned to the name of Saracens. Vide Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum, l. 7. c. 8. as they list; to abstain from the use of wine, except on certain solemn daies in the year; to have and worship only one God omnipotent, saying that Moses and the Prophets were great men, but Christ was greater, and greatest of all the Pro∣phets, as being born of the Virgin Mary by the power of God, without mans seed, and at last was taken up to heaven, but was not slain, but another in his likeness for him. Fox's Act. and Monum. Vol. 1. p. 161. See 963, 964. The Persians beleeve in Mahomet, yet the Turks and they differ in opinion about him, the one pursuing the other with most deadly hatred, insomuch that there is almost continuall Warre between them.In Alcorano libro Legis co∣rum habetur, Iesum Christum Dominum no∣strum de Maria Virgine fuisse conceptum & naum, quum fine peccato vixisse inter homines, Prophetam{que} & plus quam Prophetam esse profitentur.

Lex illorum, quam Diabolo dictante, ministerio Sergii Mo∣nachi apostacae & haeretie, Mahometus Arabiè scriptam Saracenis dedit & docuit, à gladio caepit, per gladium tenetur, & in gladio termntur. Iste Mahometus illiteratus fuit, sicut ipse in Alchorano suo testatur: qui quae praenominatus haereticus dictavit, ipse praed: cavit. Et quia potens erat, & Arabum Princeps, per comminationes suas legem statuit observari. Luxurio∣sus autem suis & bellicosus, & ideo de immunditia & vanitate legem dedit, quam carnaliter viventes in partem voluptatis observant: & sicut legem Christi veritas & munditia muniunt, ita errorem ipsorum timor mundanus & humanus, voluptas{que} carnalis extollunt.

The Alcoran is stuft with obsceanness, lies, miracles, visions, morall and na∣turall Philosophy▪ such trash as may wonderfully provoke the silliest Student to a height of laughter. It is in Volume twice so big as the Psalmes of David, divided into a hundred and fourteen Chapters. He denies Christ to be the Son of God, and saith, that the Virgin conceived by smelling to a Rose presented her by Gabriel,
and, that he was born out of her breasts. Also that he was not crucified, but Iudas or some other wicked thief; Christ being separated from them by a cloud that covered him, and came from heaven, Herb.

Quam longè latéque se diffuderit pestiferum illud virus haereseos Mohamedicae, historiae passim docent, & qui Regiones Orientis peragrárunt testari facilè possunt.

Their peremptory restraint (even on the pain of death) of all disputations touching their Religion, and calling any point of it into question. 2. The sensuall liberty allowed by it, viz. to have many wives, and the like promise of sensuall pleasures to succeed after this life (to the Religious observers of it) in Paradise. God was pleased to suffer a base Epileptick person, a villain and vitious, to set up a Religion which hath filled almost all Asia and Africa, and some parts of Europe.

Some suppose they are not unlike in time to be the chief cause of the ruine of that large Empire.

The Turk is forced to take this course, lest the rest of his Jani∣zaries should mutiny when any of their fellows is put to death. That complicate errour of the Socinians sprung from Mahometism.Turpissimam Sōcinistarum gentem è fi∣metis Muhammedanorum prosiliisse, hinc certum est, quòd non modò blaspheme ore conspirant cum Turcis in abneganda Iesu Christi divina natura verùm etiam quòd eum in finem Christianam fidem ita subvertant, ut Christianos cum Muhammedanis uniat ac consocient faedere exsecrabili.

CHAP. IV. The third false Religion is Iudaism. THey were after the Babylonian Captivity casled Jews of the chief and royallPurch. Pilgrim. l. 2. c. 11. Tribe, and their Country Iudea. Before Christs death the Gospel was revealed only to the Jews, a few Gentiles were brought in, as Rahab, Iob, the people of Nineveh; after his resurrection it was revealed to all Nations, Mark 16. 16. The first Church that ever was gathered, was of the Jews, Matth. 15. 24. Luke 24. 47. Because 1. They were the first-born, and their Fathers were in Covenant with God, Gen. 17. 7. 2. Christ came of them after the flesh, Rom. 9. 4, 5. The Jews look for a Messiah to come in outward pomp, yet some of their Rab∣bines say, In Regno Messiae nihil mundanum. They detested the Publicanes of old as most vile sinners, but now they are the only Publicans who serve under the Turk; no man will trust them now they are so perfidious. See Deut. 32. 26. They are of more vile account in the sight of Turks then Christians; insomuch that if a Jew would turn Turk, he must first turn Christian before they will admit him to be a Turk, Biddulphs Travels. They deride Christ with that reproachfull and despitefull name Talui, which is as much as hanged or crucified.

There are three principall Sects among the Jews, Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes.
1. Pharisees. They were the strictest Sect among the Jews, Act. 26. those that pretended most of all to walk according to the rules of the Jewish Religion. Paul the Apostle was a Pharisee. See of them Spanhem. Dub. Evan. parte tertia, Dub. 28. & Cameron on Matth. 20. v. 3. 2. The Sadducees.

Vide Camer. praelect▪ Tom. 3. in Matth. 20. v. 3. p. 45. to embrace the Law, not looking for a reward, that is, for love of it self. Sadoc and the Sadducees after him taught that there was no reward after this life, and therefore no resurrection. Dr Lightfoots 3d part of his Harmony, Sect. 6. It is noted of them, that of all other Sects, they were the most cruell in their judiciall censures, as Euseb. Eccles. Hist. l. 2. c. 14. out of Iosephus. They denied the resurrection and last judgement; so as they were Atheists. This made them dare to practice all cruelty and injustice: For Maxima peccandi illcebra impuni∣tatis spes. See of them Spanhem. Dub. Evang. parte tertia Dub. 29. 3. The Essenes. From whom some fetch the originall of Christian Monks. There were also Scribes, Learned men, which professed the reading and inter∣pretation of the Law, either of the Sect of the Pharisees or Sadducees. The Jews had so high an opinion of the Scribes and Pharisees, that they thought if but two went to heaven, one must be a Scribe and the other a Pharisee. For Justification, They found no need of the righteousness of Christ, there∣foreHow often doth Christ thunder a∣gainst the Scribes and Pharisees, Matth. 15 6, 9, 12. Matth. 23. severall verses. Christ saith he came not to call such righteous persons (in their own conceit) but sinners. See Rom. 10. 3. For Sanctification: All their righteousness came from self, that which may be found in a naturall man; they knew not what Regeneration or a new nature meant, Iohn 3. 4. 10. 2. Not the Law, but their interpretation of it was their rule, Matth. 5. 27. 3. They pleaded their obedience before God, All these have I kept from my youth. The Rabbins have much from old Writers agreeable to the Apostles Doctrine, but stained with dogged blasphemies, notwithstanding their readiness in the Text and Records in pieces of ancient Truth must be regarded. As touching their say∣ings, fighting for us against themselves, I think them profitable when they are cited with skill, what they do mean or ought to mean, otherwise they will trouble much men little acquainted with them. H. Broughton of Melchis. Two things are most firmly to be held against the Jews. 1. That the promised Messiah is come. 2. That Jesus of Nazareth is the true Messiah. The first is most certain from these Arguments. 1. Because the Messiah ought to come when the Scepter was taken from Iudah, Gen. 49.If the words of our Fa∣ther Iacob be true, and there is no Scepter nor Law giver now in the house of Iu∣dah, then must it needs be this man Jesus, whom we confess and believe, is that Shilo which was to come. The Confession of Faith made by Nathanael the Jew, Baptized by Mr. Fox. 10. 2. Because he was to come before the destroying of the second Temple, Hag. 2. 8, 10. Mal. 3. 1. 3. Because the place of the Nativity of the Messiah hath been destroyed for 1500 years and more: That is, Bethlehem, Mic. 5. 2. 4. Because the Oracles and Heathenish Idolatries, and also the Leviticall Cere∣monies have ceased, Zach. 13. 2, 4. Dan. 9. 26, 27. The second also is most certain, That Jesus of Nazareth is the true Messiah, be∣cause all the Prophesies of the Old Testament concerning the Messiah, agree to him.
1. He was born when the Scepter departed from Iudah, according to the Pro∣phesie of Iacob, Gen. 49.Locus hic est insignis, & ve∣hementer urit Iudaeos. Quare vix alius est, quem tot & tàm variis tmque inter se discrepantibus glossis contami∣naverint. Helv. System. Controv. Theol. quae Christian. cum Iudaeis interce∣dunt. 10. 2. He came while the second Temple stood, Hag. 2. 8. Mal. 3. 1. 3. He was born in Bethlehem, Mic. 5. 2. Matth. 2. Luk. 2. 4. When he came the Oracles ceased, according to that Zach. 13. 24. as it is manifest from Plutarch, about the ceasing of Oracles, Iuvenals 6th Satyre and Ecclesiasticall History. 5. He abrogated the Leviticall Ceremonies and Sacrifices, Dan. 9. 26, 27. Ier. 3. 16. Aben-Ezra upon Isa. 52. 13. confesseth that the Jewish Rabbins affirm, that those things are spoken of the Messiah. So also doth Abrabaneel upon the place: and the Chaldee Paraphrast there for  My servant, hath  My servant Messiah. The Conversion of the Jews is called by Paul a mystery, it is uncertain when it shall be.Marsilius Fici∣nus in his book de Relig. Christian. c. 37. gives these reasons why the Jews do not yet im∣brace the Christian faith, Prophe∣ticorum Christianorumque mysteriorum divina profunditas; & quia divina, ideo humana intelligentia non penetrabilis Rursus ingenium mercenariorum miserabilium{que} Iudaeorum incultum prorsus & pertinax. Avaritia tum ejus, quod suum est servandi, tum faciendi faenoris inexplebilis. Naturalis suorum amor innatum odium Christianorum. There are divers hinderances of their Conversion. 1. The great differences among Christians. 2. Their slighting and undervaluing of Gospel Ministry and Ordinances, the multitude of Heresies and Blasphemies. 3. Their loose lives, swearing, cursing, Sabbath-breaking. 4. The great Idolatry of the Church of Rome, artolatria & iconolatria: The Jews hate Image-worship. 5. The severe carriage of Christians in civil commerce with them. Helps to their Conversion. 1. Unity. 2. Holiness of life and conversation. 3. The love of the Gospel, and propagation of it to dark places. 4. Knowledge and skill in the Old Testament, and Rabbins. 5. Earnest prayer. When we were out of Covenant they prayed for us,Nihil (mihi credite) ad Iudaeorum im∣pudentiam con∣futandam repe∣ritur adeo va∣lidam, nihilque ad eorum con∣vincendam ne∣quitiam tam efficax inveni∣tur, ut est Hebraicae linguae & traditionum suarum cognitio.

Iohannes Isaac a Jew was converted by reading Isa. 53. And conferring with five Rabbins at Frankefort, out of that Chapter he brought them to such straits, that they could not answer. Isaac contra Lindanum l. 2. defens. Heb. verit. Lyra, Immanuell Tremellius, Paulus Ricius, Lud. Carretus, were converted Jews. Mr Fox preached a Sermon at the Baptisme of a Jew.

We protest and proclaim that we have very little hope of their salvation, who either out of negligence of seeking the truth, or unwillingness to finde it, live and die in the impieties of that Church. Chillingworth ch. 3. Sect. 63. Sr Edwin Sands in his Europae speculum, or Relation of Religion of the Western parts of the World, discovers fully the superstitions and gross corruptions of the Church of Rome. He shews how their State is strangely compacted of infinite contrarieties. What pomp, what riot to that of their Cardinals? What severity of life com∣parable to their Hermites and Capuchins? Who wealthier then their Prelates? Who poorer by vow and profession then their Mendicants? On the one side of the street a Cloyster of Virgins: On the other a Sty of Courtezans, with publick toleration: This day all in masks with all looseness and foolery; to morrow all in Processions, whipping themselves till the blood follow. On one door an Ex∣communication, throwing to hell all transgressours; on another, a Jubilee or full discharge from all transgressions. He saith this is a Proverb recorded in their own books, That the worst Christians of Italy are the Romanes, of the Romanes the Priests are wickedest, the lewdest Priests are preferred to be Cardinals, and the baddest man among the Cardinals is chosen to be Pope. There is a twofold separation. One condemned, Iude v. 19. when men separate from a Church where salvation is to be had: Christ did not separate from the communion of the Jewish Church, Iohn 4. 21, 22. but from the corruptions of it. He frees the Law from the false glosses of the Pharisees, the 5th, 6th and 7th Chapters of Matthew, he would
not joyn with them in their superstitious purifications. They kept the Passeover a day after its time, he kept it a day before they kept it, Matth. 26. 27. 2. Another commended andPalam est no∣stram à nobis Ecclosiam re∣formatam esse ex mero ipsius verbo quod unum est pro regula, ad quam & instituenda illa sit, & tuenda legitime. Plusquam idonea sunt rationes quae ad mutationem illam nos adegerunt cujus praejudicio falso urgemur. Primum nempe caput Christianismi est, ut Deus colatur.

Et qualis est Dei invocatio in toto Papatu, nisi cum dubitatione & diffidentia conjuncta, quatenus non tenetur Christi munus, quod in eo positum est, ut intercedat pro nobis, ut ejus nomine à Deo exaudiamur. Porro quid sunt aliud publicae illae preces, quam stre∣pitus ignoti & velut exotici ululatus?

To reform the principall parts of the Church, viz. the Prelates, and gives directions for that. 4. To reform about Religion and religious persons, and he prescribes rules for that. 5. To reform the other Ecclesiasticall persons. 6. To reform the Christian Lay-people. Vide Wolfii Lect. Memorab. Centen. 15. Luthers time confessed that the Doctrine of the Church of Rome was corrupt and needed Reformation, and some that were his contemporaries, and also after him, did the like. One saith the Papists Liturgies are full of Idolatry and blasphemies, their Legends full of lies, their Ceremonies of superstition. Cardinall Mattheo Langî, Archbishop of Salzburg, told every one, that the reformation of the Mass was honest, the liberty of meats convenient, and the de∣mand just to be disburthened of so many Commandments of men, but that a poor Monk should reform all, was not to be endured. And Cornelius Scoperus the Emperours Secretary, said, that if the Protestant Preachers had money, they would easily buy of the Italians what Religion pleased them best, but without gold it was impossible to make theirs shine in the world. Hist. of the Counc. of Trent, l. 1. pag. 55. The Pope in the beginning of the Councell of Trent, being desired to make a Reformation to please the Lutherans, No saith he, it is in vain, a whole Reforma∣tion will undo the Church, and a half Reformation will not gratifie the Lutherans, therefore it is better to imbitter both the parties. In the vacancies of the Sea of Rome the Cardinals use to compose certain capitu∣lations to reform the Papall Government, which all swear to perform, if they shall be assumed to the Popedom, though it appear by all precedent examples, that every one sweareth with a minde not to keep them in case he shall be Pope. For so soon as he is elected, he saith he could not bind himself, and that he is at liberty by gaining the Papacy. History of the Councel of Trent, l. 1. p. 71.

God stirred up in severall ages some publick and constant Confessors of the Faith, which publickly set themselves against Popery, some of which resisting it even unto blood, had the Crown of Martyrdom. Those Confessors may be di∣stributed into three Classes or ranks. The first comprehends the whole Churches, the Waldenses and the Greek Church. The other comprehends the Emperours and Kings which opposed themselves to the Papall Tyranny. The third the Doctors and Martyrs, which taxed the errours and abuses brought into the Church. Bellarmine, Bozius, Cocceius, Costerus and others, have written many things of the Marks or Signes of a Church: Costerus reckons three, Cocceius five, Bellar∣mine fifteen, Bozius a hundred: Some assign more, some fewer Marks, but all greatly glory of the holiness of the Roman Church, as a speciall and infallible note: If the question be of the Roman Church, they answer, It is One, Holy, Catholicall, Apostolicall: If of the Papall Sea, The Holy, Apostolicall Sea: If of the Pope of Rome, The most Holy Father; If they speak to him, Your Holiness: Oh quam sancta omnia? But whether we understand of holiness of Doctrine, or holiness of Life, how little holiness is to be found amongst them? What holiness of Doctrine is there in that Tenet, to hold that Priests may not marry. See Heb. 13. 4. What holiness of life there is amongst them, their Stews, and their dissolute courses shew.

The second, That the Pope and the Church of Rome are not subject to the holy Scripture, but have more Authority then it.Anatomie De La messe Par Pierre Du Moulin. l. 1. c▪ 9. The third, That the Pope and Church of Rome have power to change the Com∣mandments of God, and to make new Articles of Faith. Dr Ereston (as I remember) reduceth all to these two heads: 1. That the true Church cannot erre. 2. That the Church of Rome is that true Church. Peter du Moulin in his Anatomie De La messe l. 4.

Whence it came, that many Princes and Persons of quality in mortal diseases, have put on the habit of St Francis, that they might blot out all their sins. Learned Rudolphus Agrîcola dying at Heidelberg was buried in a Fraciscans habit by the Minorites, as he commanded.

Reformers did not communicate their counsels to one another; and likewise if we consider the instruments, by Luther a Monk, and other mean men in Germany, and by Edward the 6th a childe in England, and by a woman Q. Elizabeth, that such a glorious work should be effected. Also if we observe how our cause from the beginning against the will, of Empe∣rours, and many Kings, maugre the malice of Popes, hath taken increase, and by little and little spread into all Countreys.

The means taken by the first Reformers for promoting the work of Reformation of Religion. 1. They searched diligently into the Word of God, and so discovered the er∣roursThey are fitly therefore called Evangelici, from their great respect to the Gospel, and the whole Scripture. of Popery. Their care was after to translate the Bible into vulgar languages, and to interpret it to the people, and illustrate it with ample Comments. 2. They were carefull to educate children in the Principles of Christian Religion and Piety. It is a piece of Luthers counsel, if ever you would have a good Refor∣mation look to the Reformation of children. 3. They were ready to dispute with their Adversaries in all places, and speedily to reply to their writings. Nonne tot disputationes Witembergenses, Ratisbonienses, Augustanae, Spiren∣ses, Wormatienses, Bernenses, Posliacenae, Londinenses, Cantabrigienses, Ox∣onienses testes esse possunt locupletissimae: quo animo, qua doctrina, qua veritate cau∣sam Religionis nostrae propugnaverimus. Whitakeri ad Rat. primam Camp. Respons. Chamier hath answered the Papists generally in his learned Panstratia Ca∣tholica. Bellarmine is well answered by Iunius, Ames, Whitaker. The Rhemist Testament and the Notes are well confuted by Cartwright and Fulk. Casaubone hath written learned Exercitations against Baronius. Bishop Morton, Doctor Fulk and Whitaker have answered the Treatises of se∣veral Papists. Rivet and Blondel and Moulin have answered Cardinal Peroon. Bishop Usher, Bishop Andrews, Bishop Abbot, Doctor Prideaux, and others of our Divines, have stoutly opposed other Papists. The Reformed Religion is well defended by the English and French Divines. Some much commend three Epistles, that Epistle or Preface of Calvins to his In∣stitutions: That of Casaubons to his Exercitations against Baronius; and that of Thuanus or Guicchardine before his History. That of Calvins is a succinct and pi∣thy Apology for the Protestant Religion. Iels Apology was generally liked by the Reformed Churches. Daillè, Croyus, Blondel, Iacobus Capellus, Amyrot, and Gentilettus, have written in French or Latine in Defence of the Reformed Religion. 4. They diligently compiled the Histories of those times and actions, and especi∣ally Martyrologies of such as rendred by their deaths a testimony to that truth which was perfecuted in them.Quod verò ve∣terum doctrinam ita extollis, ut nostri temporis homines, neque pietate, neque eruditione cum ipsorum minimo conferendos esse censeas, id mi∣nimè serendum est. Nam quamvis nostrae tenuitatis con∣scii, id de nobis meritò possimus ac debeamus fateri, de multis tamen id, siue magna in Deum ingratitudine, & in homines injustitia dici non potest. Quam∣vis enim Patres antiqui sua habuerint ad eruditionem subsidia, duobus tamen maximè necessariis ad solidiorem sacrarum litera∣rum notitiam comparandam adjumentis, librorum copia & liuguarum doctoribus, caruerunt. Nam primum quum Cyprianus, Hieronymus, Augustinus ad scribendum accederent, pauca de Christiana Religione quibus uterentur, extabant, & ob de∣scriptionis difficultatem rara & cara erant exemplaria: Nestrum verò seculum eò feliciùs est, quod plurima etiam ab illis Pa∣tribus caterisque paulatim sint conscripta, & typographiae (olim ignotae) beneficio, magna copia & tolerabili pretio comparen∣tur: Adeò ut quae longo tempore & maximo labore à veteribus indagata sunt, ea cito ac facilè ex scriptis eorum possint addisci. Deinde verò quam pauci ex Latinis Patribus ullam Graecas inguae notitiam habuerunt, quam rari ex omnibus Patribus Hebraeae Linguae fuerunt pariti? quam pauca (ob librorum & fidelium praeceptorum inopiam) ad eam rem habuerunt auxilia, ex variis S. Hieronymis testimoniis apparet. Atque hinc factum est, ut à genuina Spiritus sancti sententia longius, praesertim in Veteri Testamento, faepius aberrarint. Nostris verò temporibus, Hebraei Graecique codices sunt in numers & linguarum periti professor non pauci quorum beneficio ita sacrae literae illustratae sunt, ut quàm plurima, quae Patrum memoria erant obscura, luce clarius videantur. Gomari. Anti. Costerus, l. 2. c. 8. As we ought highly to reverence the Fathers for their Antiquity, so in our times we owe much respect to many famous Writers, because by their most learned La∣bours they have given great light to the right understanding of the holy Scripture. We have the same instruments which they had, viz. the holy Scriptures, and far greater help. Zuinglius, Luther, Calvin, all those learned men are to be loved and highly honoured, as those that have well deserved of the Church; their Books are also to be diligently read, and to be preferred before the Volumes of many of the Fa∣thers, as those which have more truly interpreted the minde of the holy Ghost then the Fathers, which have illustrated the Christian Doctrine brought out of darknesse with wonderfull perspicuity, have comprized it with wonderfull brevity,
and explained it in an excellent method. Zanch. Prolegom. in Esaiam. Illustres illi viri, nec unquam sine summa honoris praefatione nominandi, quorumEp. Andr. Opusc. post de decimis.

Upon the view of the Doctrine of the Church of England, compiled by them in the XXXIX Articles, translated into Latine in the dayes of King Edward the 6th, and sent abroad into the whole Christian world, it was said abroad, Puritas doctrinae viget in Anglia. For the first ten years of Queen Elizabeth, most of the Papists of England came to our Churches, prayed our prayers, heard our Sermons, and received our Sa∣craments, untill by the instigation of the Jesuites, Pope Pius Quintus excommu∣nicated Queen Elizabeth, and enjoyned all the Papists not to resort to our Churches. So they did in Ireland till 88, some Spanish Priests then landing there, told them▪ it was condemned in the Councel of Trent. This is that Religion which (since the first Reformation of it, Anno 1. Edw. 6.) above one and twenty several Sessions of Parliament, as learned, as wise, as religious as ever were in this Kingdom, have allowed and approved.The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland appro∣veth the As∣semblies Con∣fession of faith for orthodox. Mr Baxter in his Confession of Faith, Sect. 41. saith thus of the late Assembly of Divines at Westminster; I so highly reverence that Assembly, that I think this Nation since the Apostles dayes, had never any that excelled it for Piety and Abi∣lity: and Sect. 3. he much magnifies both the Confession of Faith, and the Short∣er Catechism put out by the Assembly. I truly professe (saith he, Sect. 5.) I take the Labours of the Assembly, especially these three Pieces (the Confession of Faith, the larger and lesser Catechism) for the best Books, next my Bible, in my study. What Kingdom in Europe is there which hath not yielded eminent Scholars, and famous Martyrs of the Reformed Religion. France had Calvin, Farel, Viret, Sadeel, Daneus, Marlorate, Beza, Mornee, Chamier, Rivet, Peter du Moulin, Daillè, and many others. Italy brought forth and cast out (because it was unworthy of them) Peter Mar∣tyr,Vide Pezel. Mellef.

Spain had Iohn Diaz, Austen Cacalla, and also other Martyrs. Germany had Luther, Melancthon, Ioachim Camerarius and Chemnitius, Zuin∣glius, Oecolampadius, Martin Bucer, Wolfangus Capito, Caspar Hedio, Musculus, Hyperius, Foster, Avenarius, Mollerus, Pezelius. Helvetiae had Bullinger, Gualter, Pellicane, Leo Iudae, Aretius, Wolfius, Simler, Bibliander, Stuckius. England was fruitfull of Martyrs and great Scholars, Barns, Rogers, Cranmer, Latimer, Ridlie, Hooper, Philpot, Haux, Bradford, Iuel, Rainolds, Whitaker, Fulk, Perkins, Morton, Davenant, Twisse, Prideaux, and divers others. Denmark brought forth Palladius, Hemmingius, and many others. Polonia brought forth Iohannes à Lasco.

They term us those of the pretended Reformed Religion, whereas it is truly Re∣formed according to the word of God. They acknowledge themselves to be Papists, and from the Pope, and glory in the title. Luther saith, Primum oro ut nomen meum taceatur, & nemo Lutheranus sed Chri∣stianus appelletur. They suffer Turks and Iews which deny and persecute Christ, but put to death those of the Reformed Religion who believe in Christ. They say, that the Heathens (which had no knowledge of Christ) by their mo∣rality may be saved, and yet deny that Protestants, who have a knowledge of Christ, and exceed them in their morality, may be saved. Marcus Antonius de Dominis Arch-bishop of Spalato said in the hearing of some of our Bishops, Before God, and Christ Jesus my Redeemer, I will acknowledge from my heart, and professe openly, That the Church of England is a true and or∣thodoxal Church of Christ. His shiftings in Religion. The Papists urge two things much against the Reformed Religion: 1. Our divisions and differences amongst our selves, as Fitz Simons in his Bri∣tannomachia ministrorum, in plerisque Fidei fundamentis, & Articulis dissiden∣tium. Secondly, The Novelty of our Religion, as if it were no ancienter then Lu∣ther. To the first, I might answer with ZanchyEpist. lib. 1. ad Dudith. Ausim equidem affirmare nullam esse tantam inter Evangelicos in Doctrina de gratia & prade∣stinatione dissen∣sionem quam esse inter Iesui∣tas & Prde. terminantes, quorum nunc Jansenius An∣tesignanas esse videtur.

Melch. Adam. in vita Brentii., That this is rather an Argument that we are the true Churches of Christ. For there are (saith he) three kindes of Churches, 1. Where God onely reigns without contradiction: This is the Triumphant Church in Heaven. 2. Where Satan only reigns: This is the Church of the wicked and Idolaters, such are the Turkish, Jewish, Popish Churches. 3. Where God truly reigns, but not without the snares and assaults of Satan. This is the true Church of Christ, which is called Militant. This alwayes fights with the flesh, the world, Hereticks, and the Devil. The Confessions of Faith of the Churches professing the Gospel, having been long ago exhibited to the several Princes of the Countreys, States and Kingdoms, where these Churches are, are now of late very profitably published, to the con∣viction of all such as slander the Reformed Churches to be variably distracted and
rent in sunder with infinite differences of Faith. Travers answer to a Popish Treatise written to the LL. of the Councel. Amyraldus de Secessione ab Ecclesia Romana, pag. 67. saith, The chief controver∣sies inter Evangelicos; may be reduced to four heads, 1. Concerning the Nature of the Sacraments. 2. About the Person of Christ, and the Properies of both Natures in it.Lavater hath written an History, De ortu & progressu controversiae Sacramentariae. See also his 3d Decad of Ep. epist. 6. he saith in that Epistle, There is not one point in all Divinity (except those wherein we accord with them) wherein they all speak the same. 3. How the Doctrine of Predestination is to be explained. 4. What is to be held concerning the Providence of God, especially as it is con∣versant about the ill actions of the reasonable creature, and shews there also how far yet they agree in all these. Dr Hall in his Peace of Rome, shews, That Bellarmine acknowledgeth and num∣bers up above three hundred differences of opinions maintained in the Popish Church, and that Navarre confesseth near threescore differences amongst their own Doctors in one only point of their Religion. There are many Sects risen since the Gospel was first published, but none are so guilty of division as the Papists, though they extoll their own Church for Unity. They unchurch all the Churches of Christ through the world besides themselves, the Greek Church and divers others. What a State were all former ages in before the Popes Supremacy was acknowledged? The pure and primitive times. The reading of the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue is condemned amongst them as a ca∣pital crime in Spain and Italy, but allowed in England and France. Albertus Pighius dissents from Cajetane, Thomas from Lombard, Scotus from Thomas, Occam from Scotus, Alliacensis from Occam. Their nominals disagree from their reals.

The Pope in two Councels (those of Constance and Basil) was declared to be in∣feriour to a Councel. 2. For the other Objection, of the Novelty of our Religion, as if it were noUbi suerit Ecelesia ante Lutherum? in qua orbis regione vel angulo latuerit. ancienter then Luther.

Illyricus in his Catalogus Testium veritatis, and Wolfius in his Lectiones Memora∣biles, & Reconditae. And Gerhard in his Confessio Catholica sufficiently refute this Objection. Errours often lie hid under the venerable Cloak of ancient custom, Matth. 5. 21, 27, 31, 33, 38, 43. But on the contrary sound and orthodox Doctrine is undeserved∣ly taxed with the crime of novelty, Mark 1. 27. Act. 17. 19. therefore judgement is to be made of both by Scripture, Act 17. 11.
Secondly, We may retort this Question on them, Where was your Religion be∣fore the Councel of Trent? Cardinal Contarenus holding the same with us for substance in point of Justifi∣cation, and many of those learned and modest men which are reckoned for Papists, groaning under the corruptions of their Church, and desiring a Reformation of many abuses as well as we. Bishop Iewels challenge of the Papists is commonly known, with which Peter duNous sommes prests de sabir toute sorte de punition, si e cinq ce ans apres Iesus Christ, & (pourrions descendre plusbas) i se trouve un soul homme qui ait en une Religion tant soit peu approchante de la Religion Romaine telle qu' elle est auiourhui.

There is rather a conspiracy amongst the Papists then true union: as on the con∣trary, the difference amongst us is rather a diversity then a division, in circumstances or things of lesse moment, and among persons rather then generally. We are reproached beyond Sea for our unsettlement in matters of Religion, and for the diversity of opinions and sects now in the Land. Some amongst our selves also will be ready to object, That there are so many religions and opinions, that they know not which course to take. 1. Such should therefore take the Scripture onely for the rule of their faith and life. 2. They should study faithfully to know the plain meaning of the Scripture, they should reade it diligently, seek Gods direction, come to it not with forestalled con∣ceits, but with love of the truth. 3. They should resolve to obey what they shall finde upon such diligent inquiry to be the plain minde of God beyond dispute. They should practice what all Chri∣stian Sects agree in, they all confesse that God is above the creature, and to be pre∣ferred before it, that the pleasures and profits of this world are far short of the glo∣ry to come.

There are several opinions about this matter: The first is, of those who hold, That whosoever they be who differ about Reli∣gion so they be Christians, they may and ought to be reconciled and agree together in an Ecclesiastical Syncretism, so the Socinians, Libertines, Polititians, Machi∣villians. The second opinion is of those which denieth that Christians differing in Religion can or ought to be so reconciled. So the Papists, especially the Jesuites, think and teach, requiring a full consent with the Church of Rome, as that which cannot erre, and out of which there is no salvation, and cannot, nor will not bear these which differ. Hence it is a common speech amongst them, there is no other way to agreement, then by the receiving and approving of the Councel of Trent.
Many of those which professe to follow Luther, are of that opinion also, refu∣sing to joyn with those which they reproachfully call Calvinists, unlesse they will receive the Augustane Confession, as it is wont to be explained by them, and the book of Concord. The third opinion is of them who go the middle way between these extreams,Calvin in his Epistles speaks of his crossing the Seas wil∣lingly, to re∣concile the differences between the Reformed Churches: And King Iames sent to Peter du Moulin to come over hither into England to conferre with him about the method that it was fit to take for the reunion of all the Reformed Churches in Christendm, so often sollicited by Mounsieur du Plessis. See La Vie du M. du Plessis, lib. 3. pag. 403, 404. and his Memoires. Others also have laboured this way.

A universal conjunction is impossible, the rule of consent about Religion is only the word of God. The enemies of Christian Religion are twofold, Open or Close: Those openly oppose the Doctrine of Christ, and persecute his Church, viz. the Heathens, Mahometans and Iews; these treacherously and under the name of Christ, as Hereticks, but especially Arminians, Pelagians, and Pa∣pists. Altingius and others hold an agreement with both these unlawfull. To endeavour to soder different Religions and persons holding to their principles1 King. 18. 21. will make up but a medly and patcht Religion.Dum Geor∣gius Cassan∣der Papatum reformare si∣mulat: stabi∣lit & commen∣dat aeque, ac aporti hostes.

This was the way which the great Emperour Charles the fifth took to reunite the two Religions in Germany, by the Tract called the Interim, which was composed by an Apostate Minister named Islebius. But it was opposed by the faithfull Ministers, and although out of fear it was admitted by some Princes and Commonwealths, yet it was soon abolisht.

Consent we call Unity in judgment; Concord, Unity of will and desire, peace, quiet and calme conversation, a life void of janglings, and free from tumults. There may be Consent without Concord; Concord without Consent, and Peace without both. Men may agree in their opinion, and yet differ in their de∣sires; they may differ in opinion and desires, yet live in peace. That there should be a mutual amity and forbearance amongst those, who differ in matters of Church-Government, or the like, but agree in the Fundamentals is most reasonable.

Simplicii Verini Iudicium de lib. Posthum. Grotii p. 40, 41. Whether the Church of the Protestants may be reconciled with the Pa∣pists? Roma irreconciliabilis was Dr Hall's tenet.
Franciscus de Sancta Clara, Cassander, the Archbishop of Spalato, and Milli∣tier, and other Conciliators there have been, but all in vain. Gentilettus in his Preface to his Apologia pro Christianis Gallis Religionis Reforma∣tae, saith well, Imprimis hoc verissimum esse statuo, inter Catholicos Romanos & E∣vangelicos Religionis Reformatae, in multi dogmatum Articulis, & quidem praecipuis magnam esse contrarietatem. Nihilominus tamen in hoc omnes conveniunt, ut agnos∣cant & profiteantur veritatem personae Iesu Christi in duabus naturis non confusis, nec non sanctam Trinitatem Patris, Filii & Spiritus sancti: amplectanturque omnes sanctam Scripturam Veteris & Novi Testamenti. Though the Papists and we agree in these things, that we both acknowledge the Unity of the Person of Christ in two Natures not confounded, and the Trinity of the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost, and all the holy Scripture of the Old and New Testament, yet in many Articles of Religion we much differ, and chiefly in the Doctrine of Justification. Vide Whitak. d notis Eccles.

Whether any thing of Religion come under the Magistrates Cognizance, or belong to his care? That it doth, appears First, From the Nature of Christianity, it goes through his whole conversation, 1 Pet. 1. 15. and reacheth to all his relations. A Heathen Magistrate or Parent is as truly a Magistrate and Parent, as a Christian Magistrate or Parent. Christianity gives no farther power but a higher Law. The name of Christianity lies in exercising it in all our relations. Secondly, The Gospel is given for Nations, and is their great priviledge that receive it▪ Magistrates ought to take care of all National priviledges, Rev. 11. 15. Thirdly, That which God hath promised to his people as a mercy, Ma∣gistrates should labour to be, and fulfill in duty, Isa. 49. 22. Psal. 2. 11. It is a great Question, An Magistratus plures Religiones in una republica tolerareTolerantia di∣versarum Reli∣gionum quam perniciosa rei∣publicae, so Mr▪ Fox in his printed Com∣monplaces. Iactabimusne libertatem Con∣scientiis per∣mittendam esse minimè, & haec quidem libertas intelligitur, id est, ut quo quisque modo volet Deum colat. Est enim hoc merè Diabolicum dogma; sinendum esse unumquemque ut si volet pereat. Et illa est Diabolica libertas quae Poloniam & Transylvaniam bodiè ot pestibus implevit, qu nullae alioqui sub sole regiones tolerarent. Bezae Epist. 1. debeat? Whether it be lawfull for a Magistrate to tolerate many Religions in one Commonwealth? Some give this distinction in the Doctrine of Toleration. They put a difference inter Tolerationem & approbationem, a Magistrate must dis∣countenance all corrupt Doctrines, and before hand, Dissensum suum publicè de∣clarare debet. Religio non potest cogi, Religion cannot be constrained, and yet blasphe∣phemies must be restrained. See Revel. 2. 20. Hereticks should sure not be advan∣ced to high places. Toleration (intolerable Toleration) is the great Diana much cried up in these times.
Some think there is no love among men, unlesse they allow an universal Tole∣ration of all blasphemies and heresies; We must distinguish between loving of mens persons and their errours, Ephes. 4. 15. 2 Ioh. v. 1, & 3. We should joyn grace and truth, and charity together. Some give these Cautions: First, If they be such Religions as do not overthrow the foundation. Secondly, Nor such as disturb the Government established in the State or Kingdom. Thirdly, If the Professors thereof be not factious, ambitious, or pertinacious, but honest, simple, tractable, obedient to their Superiours. Some say, Take heed of two destroying extreams: First, That of the Libertines, that all should be tolerated without limita∣tion. Secondly, Others, who would have liberty for none but themselves, and men of their own opinion. For the Papists; They are not tolerated in Holland; The Jews are not only to∣lerated,Les Catholiques sont les seuls exclus de la grace univer∣selle, dont tous les autres jo∣uissent, & n' ont aucun exercice libre du tout, quoy que leur nombre ne soit pas petit, & que ceux qui suivent cette Religion, soyent pour la plus part urais Hollandois & d' ancienne extraction, Les Delices De La Hollande Premiere. partie Chapitre xxiv. but have the publick exercise of their Religion, and their Synagogues, viz. at Amsterdam. I shall not need (I hope) to say much against their Toleration, the thing is so grosly evil, and of that dangerous consequence to a Protestant State. Dr Downam Bishop of Derry preaching before the Lord Deputy and the State at Christ Church in Dublin in Ireland, Novemb. 26. 1626. produced the judgement of four and twenty Bishops (whereof only now the most reverend Primate of Ar∣magh is living) against it. Whose reasons I shall here insert. First, It is to make our selves accessory not only to the Papists Superstitions, Ido∣latry, Heresies, and in a word, to all their abominations of Popery, but also (which is a consequence of the former) to the perdition of the seduced people, which perish in the deluge of the Catholick Apostasie. Secondly, To grant them a Toleration in respect of money to be given, or con∣tribution to be made by them, is to set Religion to sale, and withall the souls of the people, whom Christ our Saviour hath redeemed with his most precious bloud: And as it is a great sinne, so it is matter of most dangerous consequence; and be∣seeching God to make all in Authority zealous of Gods glory, and the Advance∣ment of the true Religion, resolute and couragious against all Popery, Super∣stition and Idolatry, he said, Let all the people say, Amen, which they did with a loud acclamation. It is a Question propounded by HelvicusSystem Con∣trovers. Theolog. Quae Christia∣nis cum Iudaeis intercedut. Elench Iud. 8. & ult. Profecto excu∣sari Magistratus Christianus non potest▪ si impunè corum blasphemias horrendas in Christum, & S S. Trinitatem, totamque Religionem Christianam, diutiùs oculo connivente toleret. Id. ibid. Amongst Gregories Epistles, there is one De Iudaeis non persequendis., An Iudaei à Magistratu Christiano tole∣randi, & quomodo tractandi? Whether the Jews be to be tolerated by the Christian Magistrate, and how they are to be handled? He saith it is a perplex Question by reason of the different judgements. He propounds first divers Arguments of those which hold they are altogether to be cast out of a Christian Commonwealth by reason of those horrible blasphe∣mies, which daily both in their ordinary prayers, and in their speeches they belch out against Christ, the Virgin Mary, our faith, and all Christians in general, and for other reasons which he there alledgeth. Secondly, He urgeth other Arguments, to prove, that the Jews are not to be cast out, but tolerated under the Christian Magistrate, because by that means many of them may be converted by continual converse with the Christians, and the Scripture seems evidently to confirm that, Hosea 3. 4. Zephany 3. 7. Luke 21. 24. Romans 11. 25, 26. And because they may be serviceable
to them against the Pagans, and for other reasons. He himself goes the middle way, and layes down his opinion in certain Propo∣sitions: First, It is better for Jews to live amongst Christians, then under Turks or In∣fidels. Secondly, The blasphemies of Jews are not to be tolerated, but to be prohibited and most severely punished by Christians. Thirdly, The Jews are to be esteemed among Christians as the servants of ser∣vants, that is so to be handled, that they are exiles and cast off by God himself. They are not to have any publick office. They are not to practise that unjust Usury, for which they are so infamous amongst Christians. They are to have also (said he) some outward mark in their garments, by which they may be distinguish∣ed from others, and to be forced to hear Sermons. Many other Cautions doth he give in the receiving of them. As for the Toleration of the Jews, whosoever they be that suffer the exercise of their Religion, with the blasphemies they commonly use against Christ, make themselves guilty of all their wickednesse, which the Lord keep this Land from, as well as from the abomination of the Masse. The Pope can tolerate the blasphemy o the jews, and the filthinesse of all the Curtisans and Stews, and take a yearly rent o them for it, and for no respect will allow the exercise of our most holy Re∣ligion, either in his own Dominions, or wheresoever he may prevail against us.

THE SECOND BOOK. OF Learning. CHAP. I. I. Of the Dignity and Excellency of Learning. THere are three kindes of things to be desired, One, That which draws us to it self by its own force, Non emolumento captans aliquo, sed trahens sua dignitate; as Virtue, Know∣ledge and Truth. 2. Another, which is desired for fruit and profit, as money. A third, which draws us both by its own force and dignity, and by profit, the more to desire it,Eccles. . 13. Quem admo∣dum ratione homines à re∣liquis animan∣tibus, it & li∣teris homines ipsi ab homini∣bus differunt. Qui igitur scribendo in commune bo∣num aliquid proferre potest, is quidem prae stat, quod pau∣corum est praestare, propterea quod non omnium sit literas discere aut docere: tanto autem majore laude dignior est, quanto rarior est literarum scientia, quam aliarum vulgarium arium quibus humana vita continetur.

Learning is the perfection of reason, it was so prized by the Heathens, that they thought a learned man to differ as much from an unlearn∣ed, as a man from a beast. Humane Learning delivers the minde from wildenesse and barbarism. Scilicet ingenuas didicisse fideliter Artes. Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros. Ovid. de Pont.

But the accent had need be put upon fideliter (as Sir Francis Bacon well ob∣serves) for a superficial knowledge doth rather work a contrary effect. Ego benè literatos viros eo benigniores candidioresque semper expertus sim, quo magis & ingenio & eruditione pollerent. Pier. Valer. Hieroglyph. lib. 23. cap. 4. He instanceth there in Pntanus, Antonius Sabellicus, Pmponius Laetus, and shews how candid and cour∣teous they were to all, and concludes, Iacobi Sadoleti nomen aetate nostra in modestiae a∣biit appellationem. How much more effectual is divine learning? Esa. 11. 9. Secondly, It mitigates the fear of death and adversity. If a mans minde be sea∣soned with the contemplation of mortality, and the corruptible nature of things, he will be ready to concurre with Epictetus, who going forth one day, saw a wo∣man weeping for her pitcher of earth; and going forth the next day, he saw ano∣ther weeping for her sonne, said, Heri vidi fragilem frangi, hodiè vidi mortalem mori. Thirdly, The pleasure and delight of Knowledge and Learning far surpasseth all other pleasure and delight; Therefore the Egyptians, Caldeans, Grecians, Ro∣mans, have so highly prized humane wisdome, that they were willing to undergo any labour or cost for the purchasing of it.

A competent knowledge of the Languages, at least of the three learned ones, Hebrew, Greek and Latine, is very convenient, if not necessary, for one that would be a compleat Divine; Such see with their own eyes. The knowledge and interpretation of Tongues is a very great gift of God, pro∣mised by him in times past, Esa. 19. 18. bestowed by Christ, attributed to the holy Ghost, Acts 2. Paul commends the study of Languages to the Church and all its members, 1 Cor. 14.

But saith Mr Webster in his Academiaerum ExamenPag. 6., It is not yet infallibly con∣cluded which are the true original Copies (especially concerning the Hebrew and the oriental Languages) the Jewish tongue having been often altered and corrupt∣ed by their several intermixtures with, and transmigrations into other Nations, or that they have been purely and sincerely preserved unto our hands. For Langua∣ges change and alter as fashions and garments; Neither have we any thing to assure us in this point, but bare tradition and history, which are various, perplex, dubious, contradictory and deficient. To this I answer, Who (but the ignorant) deny that the Hebrew Copies are the Original of the Old Testament. Were not the Scriptures of the Old Testament committed to the Jews? And was not the Hebrew the Jewish language? In∣deed the Jews by their Captivity in Babylon learned the Chaldee tongue, and so some of the Old Testament, as Ezra and Daniel were written in that lan∣guage. Secondly, What if the Jewish tongue hath been often altered and corrupted, and generally languages change and alter like fashions and garments? Is that any rea∣son why we should doubt of the sincerity of the Hebrew Copies? By this reason we must question the works of Demosthenes, Cicero, and generally all others, be∣cause the languages wherein they wrote was since altered. Thirdly, Is there nothing but bare tradition and History to inform us of the ori∣ginals, when as the originals themselves are extant before our eyes? And we may know them to be sincere, because generally all Copies throughout the world, though written at several times in several places do accord.
He objects further, Pag. 7. Knowledge of Tongues can but teach the Gramma∣tical Construction, signification and interpretation of words, propriety of phra∣ses, deduction of Etymologies, and such like; all which tend to no farther then the instamping of a bare literal understanding, and all this may be, the my∣stery of the Gospel being unknown, for the letter killeth, but the Spirit gi∣veth life. To this I answer with Melancthon, If we understand not the signification ofScriptura non potest intelligi Theologicè nisi prius in∣telligatur Grammatice. Melancth. the words, how can we know the things signified by them? Whereas he opposeth tongues, and the Spirit, Subordinata non pugnant, If he will so rely on the Spirit, as utterly to exclude tongues, Why doth he make use at least of his mother-tongue for the understanding of the Scriptures? He saith there, He that understands the original tongues, in which the Text was written, conceives no more of the minde of God thereby, than he that only can reade or hear read the Translation in the mother-tongue. Yes, because the minde of God is primarily in the Original, and but secondarily in the Translation, in that the Translation is out of the Original, and doth no further contain in it the Word of God, then it doth agree with the Original. He addes yet further, What difference is there between him that relies upon his Teachers skill, and he that relies upon the skill of a Translator, are they not both alike, since they are but both Testimonia humana, full of errours, mistakes and fallacies? It is much that he cannot perceive a difference between these two: He that relies upon the skill of a Translator, relies upon it for that particular Translation which he doth make use of: but he that relies upon the skill of his Teacher onely, relies upon it for his general knowledge of the language which is taught him besides, no man hath need so wholly to rely on his Teachers skill, having many other means to know whether his Teacher rightly instruct him or no, as some have to rely on the skill of a Translator, p. 7. But he proceeds. The errours and mistakes that still remain, and are daily discovered in all Transla∣tions, do sufficiently witnesse mens negligence and ignorance, that in the space of sixteen hundred years, have not arrived at so much perfection, as to compleat one Translation. This very reason which he alleadgeth against the knowledge of Tongues, dothEt sancta He∣braea est lin∣gua, & cuivis Theologiae studioso ne∣cessaria. Etsi enim monu∣menta Aposto∣rum & Evan∣gelistarum Graeca sunt: tamen phrasis est Hebraica. Itaque rectè dixerunt vete∣res: Hebraeos bibere ex fonti∣bus: Graecos ex rivulis: Latinos ex lacunis. Melch. Adam. in vita Graseri. Paulus linguarum genera tenere donum putat Spiritus Sancti, nos adeò ridemus, ut vix homine putemus dignum? Paulus divinationis muneri, vel anteponit, nos Sophisticis etiam nugis postponimus? Paulus gratias agit Deo, cujus beneficio tantum sibi bonum contigerit, nos eos, qui nobis tantum bonum etiam domi desidentibus è longinquo adferunt, circulatores vocitamus, & indignis modis tractamus? Pet. Mosell. Orat. de var. Ling. Cognit. Vide Crines. De Confus. Ling. cap. xi & xii. shew the necessity of it. For if errours and mistakes do still remain, and are daily discovered in all Translations, Is there not the more need of skill in the Originals, that so we may not be carried away with those errours and mistakes? And how should those errours in Translations be discovered but by skill in the Originals. But suppose that no mans skill in the Originals is so great, as to free him from errours and mistakes in translating, is therefore all his skill to no purpose? By the same reason all Mr Websters preaching should be in vain, because he is not infalli∣ble, but sometimes may mistake the meaning of the Scripture which he ci∣teth. I suppose it therefore very profitable for a Divine (which I think was Reverend Mr Wheatleys usual practice) to reade daily a Chapter in the Old Testament in He∣brew, and in the New Testament in Greek. Illud enim volo, Theologiae studios & verbi Dei ministro tantum semper debere esse à rebus aliis otii, ut quotidiè caput aliquod in utriusque Testam. Originali Textu le∣gat, & quidem cum brevi sucinctoque Commentario, vel Junii, vel Bezae, vel Piscat. vel Vatabli. Sixt. Amam. Consilium de studio Ebraico feliciter instituendo. Secondly, The Knowledge of the Arts is also very requisite for a Di∣vine.
Therefore Licinius and Iulian envying such a good to the Church of Christ used their endeavours to deprive the Christians of the studies of them, most vain sports being set up in their room. Christ at first (to shew the glory of his greatnesse) took and imployed Fisher∣men, such as had no bringing up in Schools. But it was not long after, but learn∣ed men came in apace. Learned men of all sorts, Zenas in Law, Tit. 3. 13. Luke in Physick, 1 Tim. 4. 11. Apollo with his Eloquence, Act. 18. 24. Dionyse with hisUrbs Tarsus clara Schola & Academia à Strabone cele∣brata lib. 14. Divi Pauli patria. Neand. Geog. part. 2. Philosophy, Act. 17. 34. Paul with his much learning, Act. 26. 24. which he had at Tharsus, as famous an University for Asia, as Athens was for Greece. See 1 Cor. 14. 18. Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Aegyptians, Act. 7. 22. which Nation was one of the most ancient Schools of the world. Salomon passed all the children of the East in their own learning, 1 King. 4. 30. Daniel was brought up, and well seen in the cunning of the Chaldeans, Dan. 1. 4. First, All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid in the Scripture, ofNumerorum imperitia mul∣ta facit non intelligi, tran∣slatè ac mysticè posita in Scripturis.

How shall a Minister be able without some skill in Logick to analyze his Text? The whole Scripture abounds with Arguments, the strength of which one cannot perceive but from Logick, and how shall he be able to discover or confute the so∣phistry and false reasoning of Hereticks without it. Cham. Corp. Theol. lib. 2. cap. 18. Of the use of Logick in Divinity, See Mr Gataker against Saltmarsh, Shadows without Substance, p. 20. He may draw likewise excellent sentences, famous examples, profitable precepts from History and Philosophy. The Scripture is full of Metaphors and figurative speeches which have profit as well as ornament. A great part of the whole 6th of Iohn is framed of such speech∣es, how shall one understand the meaning of such places without some skill in Rhetorick? Secondly, The knowledge of the Arts is requisite for a Divine to refute errors.Chronólogia & Geographia principem sibi locum vendi∣cant in Theo∣logia quia in sacris literis continetur praeter fidei morumque praecepta, etiam Ecclesiae historia. Est autem olim dictum, Histo∣riae oculos esse Chronologiam & Geographi∣am. Haec terrarum ambitum describens, locos judicat quibus singula gesta, adeóque quasi in rem praesentem de∣ducit. Illa verò annorum saeculorumque seriem explicat. Cham. Corp. Theol. lib. 2. c. 18. The Socinians begin in Philosophical principles, and the Papists begin in Logick about accidents, when they would establish their Transubstantiation. Zanch. de Tribus Elohim parte altera, cap. 1. reckons up this as one cause of heresie, viz. the ignorance of true and solid Philosophy and Logick, and the Li∣beral Arts. How many Chronological difficulties are there in the Scripture, which will not be resolved without some skill in Chronology. Compare 1 King. 6. 1. with Acts 13. 20. 2 Kings 24. 10. with 2 Chron. 36. 9. 2 Chron. 22. 2. with 21. 20. Some say the holy Ghost did obscure some things in Chronology to sharpen mens wits. Object. Colos. 2. 8. Beware least any man spoil you through Phylosophy and vain deceit, , i. e. through the vain deceit of Philosophy, for either it did promise eternal life, or did not shew the true and certain way which led thither. So Grotius. Some think he bids them beware of Plato's Philosophy, not of Philosophy in general, Neque Apostolus ad Colossenses veram & naturalem Philosophiam, sed ina∣nem duntaxat & deceptricem damnavit. Zanch▪ ad Arianum Respons. The learning of the Magi (who were skilled in the Stars and Bodies Celestial)
hindred them not in their coming to Christ. The gold and spoils of Egypt, did the Tabernacle no hurt, which was hung all over with them.Some think it is a childish thing for a Minister to use exotick language in a popular Audi∣tory from 1 Cor. 14. 20. Humane Learning may be lawfully used in a divine exercise, four conditions be∣ing observed. The first concerns the end, the confirmation of faith, not vain glory. Secondly, If the prophanenesse or Ethnicisme in them be castrated, as Deut. 21. Thirdly, That we alwayuse humane learning as we give the Scripture the upper-hand. Fourthly, That these ations of humane Writers, be used not as meat,Vide Sculteti Orationem De Conjun∣genda Philo∣logiam cum Theologia. We arters (sath Paul) to the learned and unlearned. Zanchius in his second Oration, De con∣servando in Ecclesia pro puto Dei verbo, shews, That there are only three necessary causes which happen but seldom, for a good Preacher; extra limites S. literarum, per scripta Poetarum & Philosophorum, aut etiam, Patrum evagari, either by reason of the obstinacy of hereticks, which being not satisfied with the Scriptures, are to be convinced with other rea∣sons and testimonies, or for the calumnies of the malevolent, which it is necessary to refell with other testimonies then those of the Scriptures; or lastly, by reason of the infirmity of some weak brethren, which cannot be a holly divorced from their old superstiti, and be setled in the truth delivered, unlesse the same be also confirmed by the stimonies of the ancient Fathers. The Apostle Paul thrice indeed cith the sayings of profane Poets, because they were fi for the matter which he handled, but be neither names the Poets, neither did he do it often (saith he) nor without good reason, but only mentions some short speeches of theirs, seldom, soberly, and as it were obiter, being compelled thereto, that the Gentiles by the sayings of Gentiles might be convinced. Therefore the Fathers do not so use the sayings of Philosophers and Poets in their Homilies to the Church, as in their disputations and books against the Heathens. but as sauce, sparingly. Dr Chalon Sermon Tit. 1. 13. Philosophandum est sed paucis. Humane knowledge or learning is abused: First, When we rest in it, lean not to thine own understanding, when we think to look into divine mysteries with the spectacles of nature. Secondly, When we boast of it as our chiefest excellency, Ier. 9. 23. Religion is the highest excellency, the truest wisdom is that whereby we know and enjoy the chiefest good. Thirdly, When we oppose learning to the wisdom of Scripture, and confine God to the Laws of nature, 1 Cor. 1. 23. Fourthly, The naked Theory of divine knowledge, idle and unactive know∣ledge, all knowledge is for practice, Prov. 14. 8. Psal. 111. 10. Deut. 4. 6. Prov. 8. 30. Some times are more favourable to learning then others. About the time of our Saviours coming, curious Arts, and other civil Disci∣plines did most flourish. The Grecians sought after wisdom, and secular Philoso∣phy, the Romans after Policy, State-knowledge and Discipline of rs. All the world almost (above others, those parts wherein Christianity was first placed) was then set upon curious Arts, yet the study and search of Scriptures in a short time devoured all, and brought them to acknowledge allegiance unto it. Dr Iacks. Comment on the Creed Vol. 1. l 1. c. 3. Wolfius in his Lectiones Memorabiles mentions the learned men of every Cen∣tury. Superstition and ignorance both together at the latter end of the ninth Century, as a thick mist dangerously invaded and possessed the Church, when the forging of Legends and Relicks, and such like trumpery was as common and highly esteem∣ed as the Scripture, and preaching was discountenanced, and utterly out of use. Some places also are more propitious to learning then others. Athens in Greece, of which see afterwards.Basilea omni∣bus tempori∣bus produxit viros doctrin, sapientia arque eloquentia maximos. Neand. Geograph parte 12. Prodierunt ex Sicyone quemadmodum Athenis multi viri praestantes in omni artium ac doctrinarum genere. Id. ibid. Corduba in Spain is celebrated also this way. It was the Countrey of Avicenna, and Averroes and Razis, and of Seneca Neroes Master, and Lucan the Poet.

Of the Liberal Arts and Sciences. AN Art is a Collection of universal precepts prepared to know, act or workArs est rei cu∣jusque scien∣tia, usu, vel traditione, vel ratione praece∣pta, tendens ad usum aliquem vitae necessarium. Bibliand. de rat. Comm. omnium lig. Ars est collectio universalium praeceptorum parata ad cognoscendum, agendum, vel operandum, in certa aliqua finis latitudine. Ludv. Viv. de tra∣dend. Discip. lib. 1. in some certain latitude of end. Naturam mulatur ars, sed non planè assequitur, saith Bibliandr, as we may see in painting and many other works. All Arts are distinguished by the end not the matter. SenecaConsolatio∣ne ad Marci∣am. cap. 18. Gen. 4. 21, 22. The knowledge even of mechanical Ars ought to be referred to God the Aour, as the very Gentiles by the light of Nature were forced to confesse, and the Scripture witnesseth in the builders of the Tabernacle of Moses, and of Solomons Temple. distinguisheth Arts into three kindes, some which instruct the life, others which adorn it, others which rule it. The mechanical Arts instruct the life. Liberal Arts are properly those which become free and ingenuous men, which re∣quire understanding, not the operation of the hands.
They are called Liberal Arts, because they are worthy of a Freeman, and inge∣nuous,Artes ingenuae seu liberales idcirco appel∣latae sunt, quod libero ac in∣genuo sint ho∣mine dignae: sive quòd li∣beros suos se∣ctatores effici∣ant, & in fasti∣gio rerum hu∣manarum qua∣si reges collocent & reponant. Cael Secund. Cur. Orat. de ingenuis artibus. Latini artes vocant liberales tanquam libero homine dignas. Voss de Philol. cap. 1. Sunt artes universae in duo genera distriuae: in Logicas & Mathe∣maticas. Logicas appellarunt quae in sermonis ratione versantur: Mathematicas, in qunirate. Quantitatis au∣tem duplex genus fecerunt, aliud dejunctum, aliud conjunctum. Dejuncta ad numeros pertinent, ex quibus ea disciplina manavit, quam Arithmeticen dixere▪ Quemadmodum ex conjunctis Geometria, in qua lineamenta, formae, intervalla, magnitudines versantur. Porro numeri ipsi ad harmoniam translati, Musicem pepererunt, ea enim numeros, voces, & modos coninet. Geometriae facultas ad res coelestes accommodata; nobis dedit Astro∣logiam, in qua Coeli conversio, ortus, obitus, motúsque siderum considerantur. Rursum eadem ipsa Geometria ad vim cernendi traducta, Opticen produxit, quae causas affert cur oculi interdum vivendo decipiantur, cùm aut majores, aut minores, quàm sint res, esse videantur. Ex hac vero & ipsa Geometria, pingendi ars orta videtur, quam veteres inter liberales numerabant. Coelii Secun. Cur. Orat. de ingenart. as if only ingenuous persons should learn and exercise them. It is a received opinion, That there are seven Liberal Arts, three concerning speech, Grammer, Logick, Rhetorick, four concerning Quantity, Geometry, Arithmetick, Musick, Astronomy, which the Grecians call Mathematicks. Gram: loquitur, Dia: vera docet, Rhe: verba colorat Mus▪ canit, Arnumerat, Geo: ponderat, Ast: docet astra. , dicitur, quasi , that is, the circle of the Arts, which was wont to be accounted by the number of the seven Liberal Arts. Ric: Vitus Basingstock in his fifth Oration De studiorum finibus, saith, All Arts and Sciences are but ten, the seven Liberal Arts before mentioned, and three more, Ethicks, Physick, Metaphysicks, into which all Philosophy is di∣vided. Sir Francis BaconAdvancem. of Learning, l. . cap. 1. saith, That is the truest Partition of humane Learning, which hath reference to the three faculties of mans soul, which is the seat of Learning. History is referred to Memory, Poesie to the Imagination, Philosophy to Reason. Theology also or divine Learning (saith he) consists either of sacred History, ofQui autores in singulis arti∣bus legendi sint. Parables, which are a kinde of divine Poesie; or of Precepts and Doctrines, as an eternal Philosophy.In Gramma∣tica Diomodes, Prtt Valla: in Dialectica Aristoteles: in Rhetorica, Cicr & Fabi praecipui.

Eras De ratione studii. shews what should be spoken, and with what Reason; Rhetorick which is for Or∣nament; and Logick which is for Argument and proof. Some call these three general Arts, because they have their use in all things and Arts. I. Grammer. It hath its name from letters. This is as it were an usher to other Sciences, a place not very honourable, yet
necessary, it is an Antidote against that malediction of the confusion of Tongues▪ Polyd. Verg. It is an Art of speaking well. Others adde, and of writing, but in vain, when writing happens to speaking. Its end is to speak well▪ the means conducing to this end are the rules of classical writers founded on use. That which is commonly called Orthographia, is better called Orthocepia, because speaking was before writing, which happens to speech. The beginning of this Art and Rhetorick (saith Suetonius l. de grammat.) was thus, by the observation of those things which were either fit or unfit in speaking, men noting those things either to imitate or shun them, made this Art. Austin saith, That there were Grammarians among the people of Israel in the time of Moses. That would be a most excellent kinde of Grammer, if some man skilfull in ma∣ny Languages, as well learned, as mother-tongues, should write a Treatise of the divers Proprieties of Languages; shewing in what points every particular Language doth excell, and in what points it was deficient. Despauterius was a famous Latine Grammarian, Clenard a Greek one, Iohn Isaack an Hebrew one. Our Linacer also was a special Grammarian, and his books de Emendata Structura have much conduced to expell barbarism. Gerardus Vossius hath put out a most learned and elaborate book De Arte Gram∣matica, and another De vitiis Sermonis.Nuncupantur autem triviales scholae quasi vulgares, & in triviis consti∣tutae: quomo∣do nomen id▪nulli Scholae, ad Latinas, Graecasque literas discen∣das publicitus constitutae conveniat: quae rarò in triviis erectae: quin fere una duntaxat etiam in magnis est urbibus, vel potiùs inde trivialibus Scholis nomen fecerunt majores, quòd in his tres artes, Grammaticen, Rhetoricen, Logicen, do∣cerent.

Cur. Orat in Nic. Invitiat. nobil. Grammat. Trivial and Grammer Schools are to be respected and encouraged, because they are the Nurseries of Learning, there the foundation being well laid, young plants thence removed to the publick Universities, well furnished with that kinde of Learn∣ing, may prove eminent instruments in Church or State. Grammer challengeth the first place to it self, and boyes are to learn both the Greek and Latine Grammer. Non modo quod his duabus linguis omnia fermè sunt prodita quae digna cognitu videantur, verùm etiam quod utraque alteri sic assinis est, ut ambae citius percipi queant conjunctim, quam altera sine altera, certè quam Latina sine Graeca. Erasm. De Ratione Studiis. For the pure Greek writers, Erasmus commends chiefly Lucian, Demosthenes, Herodotus; and of the Poets, Aristophanes, Homer, Euripides.

The proper formall object of it is Reason, its adequate end to dispute well▪ The duties of a Logician, are either general, as that which is comprehended in
the definition of Logick, to reason well; or special, as those which be contained in the distribution of Logick, to invent well, and to judge well. Logice dirigit intellectum in cognitione veri: praecipuaque ejus instrumenta sunt ar∣gumentatio, definitio, divisio, methodus. Gerard▪ Joan. Vos. De Studiorum ratione parte priore. Zeno the Stoick said, Rhetorick was like the palm, or the hand stretcht out, Logick to the fist, he might have said more fitly (saith Ludovicus VivesDe Caus. corrupt. Art. lib. 4. Dialectica est ars benè disse∣rendi, id est, rationes rerum benè discernendi, & inter se componendi. Amos. Demonstrat. Logicae verae. Thess 1. Opus praecipium, Syllogismus, Demonstrativus. Savil. Lect. 12. in Euclyd.) that the Logician collects an Argument for the subtill examination of the learned, but the Rhetorician applies it to the popular sense, for the Oratour often more briefly collects then the Logician.

Institut. Orat. lib. 1. cap. 6. Rhetorica à  veere Graeciae verbo, quod est fluo, vel dico, dicta esse videtur, quod sermonis ornatum & copiam quandam aurei fluminis instar polliceatur. Oratoriam artem Cicero & Quintilianus, duo hujusce artis lumina hanc dici posse docuerunt, eandem tamen ferè definientes, benè dicendi tum artem, tum facultatem, tum doctrinam, tum rationem vocitarunt. Nihil aliud est eloquentia, nisi copsè loquens sapientia. Et benè dicere, non est ornatè tantum▪ sed scienter & peritè, simul & ornatè dicere. Praeclarè enim, ut omnia, illud dixit Orator: Ex rerum cognitione efflorscat & redundet oportet ora∣tio: quae, nisi subest res ab Oratore percepta & cognita, inanem quandam habet elocutionem, & penè purilem. Ut enim sine lumine corpora cernere non possumus, ita sine eloquentia nemo sensa & cogitationes suas in lucem apte proferre potest. Quod sol mundo hoc eloquentia caeteris doctrinis est, sine hac non artes modò aliae, sed res omnes, quae quidem sint dictione explicandae, in altissimo tenebrarum caligine versarentur. Cel. Sec. Cur. Orat. De ingenuis artibus., ut ornata sit. Quintil. Instit. orat. l. 1. c. 5. Nazianzene in one of his Orations saith, He affected Rhetorick so much, be∣cause he had some thing of value to esteem as nothing for Christ. Nemo te, nisi tu, exprimere rectè valet. None is able to set forth eloquence but it self. This hath immortalized Pla∣to, Demosthenes, Cicero, Homer, Virgil, Herodotus, Thucydides, Livie, Salust. Cùm Ciceronem dico, ipsam Romanam eloquentiam intelligere debetis. Cùm verò libros de oratore, opus in ea facultate putatote, quo opere nullum nec Graecia, nec Ita∣lia melius aut perfectius unquam habuit. Cael. Sec. Cur. Orat. de ingenuis artibus▪ Vide ejus orat. De Rhetoricae usu. Quintilian makes it a chief end and fruit of long pains and exercises in the ArtEloquentia maximè in liberis civita∣tibus flo∣ruit, velut Athenis & Romae, quod is certissimus esset gradus ad maximos honores ac potentiam. Ludov. Viv. de causis corrupt. art. lib 1.

Seaev. Samarth. Elog. Gallorum doctrina illustrium. l. 2. of Rhetorick, to attain to such a faculty, as to be able also upon any sudden occa∣sion to speak pertinently without any premeditation. What an inchanting force hath Rhetorick? One had need of the force of De∣mosthenes, or rather, that divine eloquence of Tully, to set forth the due praises of eloquence. Pierius Valerianus observes in the 26 Book of his Hieroglyphicks, that sweet eloquence is signified by the Hieroglyphick of the Bee. Bees setled on Plato's lips when he was a childe sleeping in the Cradle, a presage of his future eloquence. The same is reported of Ambrose and Pindar. The same Pierius in the 41 Chapter of his 20 Book of Hieroglyphicks saith, Wise men did put Syrens for the Hieroglyphick of Eloquence, and the perswading force
of Rhetorick, whence that saying of Cato the Grammarian, Cato Grammaticus, Latina Syren. CHAP. IV. Of the Mathematicks. THe Mathematicks are so named, because they are not learned without a teacher.Maheis à  di∣sco, quod hanc prae reliquis pueri olim di∣scebant. Ex∣plorandae eo∣rum indolis & ingenii ergo. Ames. Techno∣met. Mathemata quod sine prae∣ce▪ tore perci∣pi nequeant, dicta sunt.

Ideoque primas has artes apud Graecos, tanquam doctrinae quaedam rudimenta discebant cer ad reliquas scientias aditum aperiunt; Nam & ingenia acuunt eorum∣que solertiam augent, ad retum▪ coant, & celeritatem quandam percipiendi conciliant. Et quoniam imitatione percipiuntur, aprae puerilibus animis qu ea potissimum ducuntur. Ioan. à Wovver. De Po∣lymathia. Tractat. cap. 23. Non solum in mh strationum certitudine & scientiae pulchritudine: sed & veritate multiplicique cognitionis copia reliqua artium genera longe an disciplinae, adeò ut non immerito ob id Mathematicae, quasi solae disciplinarum nomine, ob excellentiam, dignae à veteribus appellatae sint. Tych. Brah. Orat. de Discipl. Mathem. Vide Ioannis Pellii Orat. inaugural. When Alexander bad his Mathematick master make his lessons easier to him then in his ordinary way to others, he answered him well, The Ma∣thematicks were alike difficult to all. The ancient Philosophers taught their Pupils Mathematicks very soon, as appears by Aristotle and others, they confirming their Propositions by mathematical demon∣strations, the knowledge whereof must be presupposed. See Tych. Brah. Orat. De Discip. Mat. The Mathematicks are a most accurate and profitable study for the evidence and certainty of their demonstrations. Abraham was famous for teaching the Mathematicks first among the Chaldeans, and after he taught the same A as Historians write. The old Mathematicians drew their proportions in dust with a Compass, the bet∣ter to shew what they would. Tully cals it learned dust.De natura Deorum. Pers. Sat. 1. Et secto in pulvere metas. Archimedes was doing this when Siracuse was taken. Princes and great persons have studied the Mathematicks, and those that studyViri nobiles, ac principes, qui non lu∣crandi, sed Philosophandi causa literis dant operam, Mathematicis maximè studiis delectantur. Inter quos celeberrimi extiterunt, ex antiquis quidem Archimedes Regum Siciliae consanguineus; Boetius vir consularis; Alphonsus Rex Hispaniarum: nostra vero aetate Marchio Guidobaldus, Princeps Ticho Brahe; Franciscus Candalla, & alii complures, quorum monumenta in omne aevum permansura mundus mirabitur. Blancani Dissertat. De Natura Mathema∣ticarum, cap. 3. them to purpose, had need to have some Princes or great persons to encourage them therein by their bounty, in respect of the chargeablenesse of their instruments, as Tycho Brahe somewhere saith. Mathematicks are either Pure or Mixt: To pure Mathematicks those Sciences are referred, which handle QuantityQui Mathe∣maticus au∣dire cupit, non Arithme∣ticam modo & Geometriam▪ quae Mathesin propriè di∣ctam & ab omni materia abstractam constituunt, verum & Astronomiam Geographiam, Opticam, Me∣chanicam, & Staticam, Musicam, Geodaesiam & Architecturam militarem, probè calleat oportet. Hortenfii Dissertat. De studio Mathematico recte instituendo. altogether abstracted from matter; and Physical axioms, they are two, Geome∣try and Arithmetique, the one handling continued Quantity, the other dissevered Quantity, or number. To mixt Mathematicks Astronomy and Musick are usually referred, and the Opticks.
I. Arithmetique is an Art of numbring well.Arithmetica est doctrina bene nume∣randi. Rami. Arichm. l. 1. Arithmetica & Musica separa∣tim magnitu∣dinem, id est, numeros con∣siderat. Geo∣metria magni∣tudinem con∣junctam, sta∣bilem & im∣motam, Astro∣nomia mobilem. Arithmetica merito prima, quae reliquis omnibus usui: ab ea & musica principia sumit. Nam ut Arithmetica proprietaes numerorum absolute considerat: ita musica easdem in soorum differentiis & propor∣tionibus contemplatur. Ratio enim harmoniae quae est musicae, numeris & figuris constat. Harum auxiliis Geometria & Astronomia utuntur. Nam sine Arithmetica, Geometria subsistere non potest. Numerorum enim cognitio prior denotatione linearum. Et ex numeris lineae inventae, ex lineis figurae productae. Astronomia à Geometria lineas & figuras ad coelorum orbes, siderum conversiones considerandas, corporum coelestium intervalla colligenda, eorumque magnitudinem describendam adsumit. Ioan▪ à Wovver. De Polymath. Tractat. c. 23. Arith∣metica subtilior est quam Geometria. Quodcunque enim vel accipit vel probat Geometria per numeros dirigi po∣test ab iis enim pendet oa magnitudinum consideratio Mathematicarum. At infinita procedent in numeris, quo∣rum multa non potuerunt in magnitudinum natura comprehendi. Scalig. De Subtil▪ ad Cardan. Exercit. 331. De∣nique si quid est, in quantitate subtilitatis, id omne ex numerorum ratione haustum est. Pender igitur Geometriae dispositio ab Arithmetici constitutione. Quae res apud neminom controversa est. Subtilior igitur haec, quae illius statuit principia, ac fundamenta. Id. ibid. Pythagoras first brought it into an Art, thence the Pythagoreans did swear per numerum quaternarium, quò nihil apud eos videtur esse perfectius. For there are four Elements, Fire, Air, Water, Earth; four times of the year, Spring, Au∣tumn, Summer, Winter; four qualities of all things▪ Heat, Cold, Moisture, Drinesse, four Coasts of the Heaven▪ East, West, North, South. It is the first of the Mathematicks, and usefull to all the rest. One should get some skill in the vulgar▪ Arithmetique before he learn Geome∣try, and that either by a teacher, or by plain books, such as the Arithmetique of Gemma Frìfius, or Ramus with Snellius his Notes. The principle of number is unity, as of magnitude punctum. By this the Pythagoreans in times past covered the mysteries of all nature, and even of God himself, as if all things were agreeable to numbers. The Phenicians write as all the Eastern Nations, from the right hand to the left: the reason why the outermost figure to the right hand in Arithmetique stands in the first place, they also being the inventers of that Science. George Sandys upon the 3d Book of Ovids Metam.Quàm mirabi∣le illud veluti scientiarum monstrum, ac portentum, quod Algebram vocant? Nihil fortasse in tota peritiae Eucycopledia subtilius, profundius nihil, non humano ingenio par est, sed quid coelitus revelatum dixeris: numeros illos, quos surdos vocant, & qui nullo modo exprimi possont addit, subtrahit, multiplicat, dividit, perinde ac si numeri communes essent. Ii qui hanc callent eruditionem nihil in numerorum infinita ditione obscurum nihil arduum timeant. Blancani Dissertatio De natura Mathematicarum, cap. 4. Some learned men speak much of the Algebra, as a famous invention in Arith∣metique. II. Geometry is an Art of measuring well. The measures of things are taken from the parts of man, his finger, palm, foot,Geometria est ars bene me∣tiendi, Rami Geomet. lib. 1. cap. 16. Geometria pars est Ma∣thematicae sci∣entiae, imò basis ac funda∣mentum, atque ut Philo scite loquitur, Metropolis omnium artium Mathematicarum. Nam ex ea, tanquam matrice civitate, derivatae sunt illae nobilissimae Coloniae, Optica, Astronomiae, caeterae; ipsaque adeò Arithmetica, cujus subje∣ctum est simplicissimum, & Geometrico simplicius, remotiúsque à materia, utpote carens situ, Geometriae ad∣miniculo stat, câque nititur, quod admirabile cuipiam videatur, ad conclusiones suas demonstrandas. Etsi ex altera parte non negarim Geometriam quoque in irrationalium praesertim doctrina, lucem & praesidium ab Arith∣metica mutuari. Savil▪ Lect. 2. in Euclyd. Habet magnas utilitates Geometria, sed voluptates etiam partibus infinitis majores habet, quibusque fimile nihil in alia ulla disciplina reperieu: neque enim Grammaticus rhetor logicus, alioqui ettam▪ physicus, & Ethicus invenit in arte sua novi laetitia elatus, immolasse diis memoratur. Thales Milesius cum trianguli in circulo inscriptionem invenisset bovem diis immolavit. Ram. Orat. De sua professione. Vide plura ibid. cubit. A barly corn is the least measure; the finger is the breadth of four barly corns; the palm, four fingers; the foot four palms. A cubit from the elbow to the end of the longest finger is a foot and an half. From those measures ariseth the measure of a journey, a pace, a furlong; a mile, a geometrical pace is five foot, a furlong 125 paces, a mile a thousand paces, eight furlongs.
Quatuor ex granis digitus componitur unus, Est quater in palmo digitus, quater in pede palmus, Quinque pedes passum faciunt, passus quoque centum Viginti quinque stadium dat, sed miliare Octo dabunt stadia, duplatum dat tibi Leuca. The Romans used a foot for their measure, as the Jews did a cubit. Plato wrote in the door of his study, , Let no man igno∣rant of Geometry enter in here. Sir Henry Savill in his ninth Lecture upon Euclyde, saith, Ars est omni∣um sine controversia certissima, it is without controversie the most certain Art of all. Tyc. Brahe in his Oration, De Disciplinis Mathematicis, shews, That divers Arts flow from Geometry, Astronomy, Opticks; that of dialing, Geography, Architecture, and the Mechanicks, All with one consent ascribe the invention of Geometry to the Egyptians. ForGeometriae olim in Aegy∣pto & Graecia plurimi certa∣tim incubue∣runt Artifices: quorum singu∣li ad artis con∣stitutionem aliquid con∣tulerunt. Euclides Me∣garensis uno complexus volumine, artis elementa continuo ordine & magna solertia ita tradidit, ut à quovis mediocris ingenii acumine praedito non difficulter percipi possent. ych. Brah. Orat. De Discip. Math. Quaestio de quadratura circuli multa praeclara exercuit ingenia. Num quaestionis subtilitatem an ingenii humani imbecillitatem, in causa esse dicemus, quod seculis tot fuere desudatum in nodo solvendo, qui adhuc sit involutus. Vossius de Scient. Mathem. lib. 1. cap. 16. when the limits of their possessions were confounded by reason of the annual overflowing of Nilus, to restore these, the reason and way of measuring fields was invented, and so Geometry may seem to have drawn its first original from the Husbandmens measuring their grounds. Thales first brought Geometry out of Egypt into Greece; Pythagoras amplified it. To whom many succeeded; Euclide hath brought the Art to that perfection, that he hath cut off hope from all his po∣sterity of enlarging it. The great difficulty among Geometricians is about the quadrature of a circle, which some say, is not faisible. III. Musick. This is either Vocal or Instrumental; Some preferre theTherpander Thebanus Mu∣sicus celeberri∣mus primus de musica scripsit. Blacai. Chro∣nol. Clarorum Mathematico∣rum. Musicae prin∣cipia primum Pythagoras ad artem reduxit. Geneb Chron. l. 2. Hic primus dicitur ex melleorum ictibus vocum diversaum numeros, modes, inflexionesque perpendendo, Musicam artem divina quadam industria confecisse. Cytharam tradunt invenisse Orpheum, Fistulam Pan Arcadius primus infla∣vit. Ringelbergius De Ratione Studii.

Antiq. cap. x. & è nostris Basilius, Chrysostomus, Hieronymus. Vossius. De vitiis Sermonis. l. 4 c. 14. Vocall. Mercer on the 4th of Genesis ver. 21. saith, Iubal was the inventer of Instru∣mental Musick. Pythagoras Musicae theoricam ex Fabri malleis adinvenit. Blancani Chronologia Clarorum Mathemat. Pythagoras invented the Art of Musick from the Smiths hammers. One seeing another playing excellently upon the Lute, said, He thought his soul was in his fingers. Leur esprits' ensuit au bout des doigts, saith Du Bartas. 1. Sept. Pythagoras, Aristoxenus, Nicomachus, Philolaus, Alypius, Ptolomaus hand∣led Musick professedly, Boetius, Martianus Capella, and venerable Bede, and Mer∣sennus have written also of Musick. IV. Astronomy.Astronomia dicitur , quia do∣cet, qua lege moveantur ac reguntur astra. Vossius de Scient. Math. c. 28. Admiranda prorsus & divina Astronomia, subjecti nobilitae cunctis prior, apta & necessaria omnibus in quibus ulla temporis ratio. Ioan à Wovver. De Polym. Tract. c. 25.

Hortensii Dissertat. do studio Mathemat. recte instituendo. The word signifies a Doctrine of the Laws or Rules of the measure and motion of the Stars.
The Subject of this Science is the Heavens with the Stars. Diodorus, Pliny and others say, that Atlas was therefore thought to sustain heaven with his shoulders, because he made a Sphere in which the whole heaven was represented. It exceeds not only Arithmetique and Geometry, but all other Arts in this kinde. Nam & antiquitate & nobilitate ac cognitionis sublimitae prae reliquis omnibus ma∣ximam sibi vendicat laudem. Tych. Brah▪ Orat. De Discip. Mathem. Peter Ramus in proaem. Mathem. complained, because we have not now Astrono∣my free from Hypotheses, and therefore easie, as the Egyptians and Babylonians had. But saith Gassendus (Praefat. In Tychonis Brahaei vitam) though some Hy∣potheses be more simple, and so more easie then others, yet Astronomy cannot consist without some. Quod autem celeberrimus ille nostri aevi Philosophus Petrus Ramus existima∣rit, sine Hypothesibus per Logicas rationes Astronomiam constitui posse, caret fun∣damento, &c. Tycho Brahe Epist. Astronom. lib. 1. Christoph. Rothman. Vide plura ibid. Thales Milesius was the first who studied the Stars, Gassendus (in the Preface be∣fore-quoted,Quantum verò ad nos in a∣storum scien∣tia pervenit, Hipparchus Rhodius, primus ejus parens cense∣tur. Is enim fixarum loca diligenter observavit. Solisque & Lunae cursus per plurimos subsequentes annos desig∣navit. Ac in caeterorum Planetarum oiusque Coeli observationibus diligentissimus fuit. Hujus inventis & considerationibus Ptolomaeus Alexandrinus cum suis collatis, totam artem in certas Hypotheses, unaque in numeros redegit, & immortalem apud omnem posteritatem hinc merito sibi pperit memoriam. Nostra vero aeate Nicolaus Copernicus, quem alterum Ptolomaeum non immeritò dixeris, admiranda ingenii solertia Hypothesibus aliter consti∣tutis coelestium motum, scientiam ita restauravit, ut nemo ante ipsum exactiùs de syderum motibus sit philosophatus. Tych. Brah. Oat. De Discip. Mathem. Ex his duobus artificibus Ptolomaeo & Copernico, omnia illa quae nostra aeate, in astrorum revolutionibus, perspects & cognita habemus, constituta ac tradita sunt. Id. ibid. and their lives) mentions Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Theon, Pappus, Alphraganus, Alphonsus King of Castile, Tycho Brahe, Copernicus, Peurbachius, and Regio-Montanus for famous Astronomers, Blanchinus, and Ptolomy, to which Gassendus himself (the Professour of Astronomy now at Paris) may deservedly be added. V. Opticks. This is a Greek word. It is called Perspectivè in Latine, a bar∣barousOptices digni∣tatem cognos∣cimus ex no∣bilitate organi ejus, quod sunt oculi, praecipi∣um cognitionis instrumentum: his enim om∣nem Philoso∣phiam debe∣mus. Etiam Opticae digni∣tatem ostendit objecti prae∣stantia; Cùm luce & colori∣bus, nihil sit melius vel jucandius. Vossius de sci∣entiis Mat. c. 24 Unam Opti∣cen video so∣lam esse artem, quae caeterarum communis splendor dici possit, quae solis instar, reliquis lucem impertiat, rerum in naturae majestate abditarum nubem dispellat. Pena de usu optles. Vide Volat. Comment. Urban. l. 35. but significant word, Optica est ars bene videndi. The Opticks is an Art of seeing well. Light and colour are visible by themselves, so it is said; Light indeed is, but co∣lours will not be visible in the dark. We should examine and weigh the writings of the chief Astronomers by this Lesbian Rule. Luceus was the first Inventer of the metal-Mines, and hence arose the common fable, that he also saw those things which were under the earth. Pisanus was the Author of the common Perspective. Alhazeus and Vitellio, and Pena on Euclide, and Peckam Archbishop of Can∣terbury have done best on the Opticks. Galen skilfull in the Opticks as well as Physicks, gives this demonstration, why one and the same appears one to two eyes, Eadem est basis pyramidum sub radiis ab oculo missis comprehensarum. There are perfect demonstrations in the Opticks; as why a hollow glasse burns, because the Sun-beams reflected are there gathered together; why a staff appears broken in the water, because it is seen by lines refracted, through a double medium of air and water.

The Pandects or Digests, containing Responsa prudentum, or the sayings of Lawyers, to which the Decree of Gratian in the Canon-Law composed out of the sentencs of the Councels and Fathers answers. 2. Codex, the Code, consisting only of the Decrees of the Emperours, to which the five Books of the Decretals answer in the Canon-Law, consisting of the Constitutions onely of the Pope of Rome. Malè actum est cum rebus humanis, cum ad Decreta accesserunt al. 3. Novellae Constitutiones, viz. Imperatoria, put out after the Code, to which in the Canon-Law the sixth of the Decretals, the Clementines and Extravagants answer. See D. Duck of the Authority of the Civil-Law, l. 1. c. 4. First, One should diligently reade the elements of the Civil-Law, comprehend∣ed in the four Books of Iustinians Institutions, Calvins Lexicon of the Law should be perused. Then we may go on to the Pandects and Code, on which there are many Commentaries. Cuiacius is an excellent Author. It is called the Canon-Law by reason of the matter, because it contains Eccle∣siastical Constitutions which they call Rules or Canons; and by reason of the end, because it was collected and confirmed to that end, that it may prescribe a Rule of Ecclesiastical Government. The Canon-Law contains The Decree of Gratian for the most part collected out of the sentences of Fathers, and Decrees of Councels. The Decretals of Gregory the ninth. The sixth of the Decretals of Boniface the eighth. The Clementines and Extravagants collected out of the Epistles and replies of the Popes. Corpus Canonum à Gratiano Monacho consarcinatum ab Eugenio 111.

Apol. c. 1. Lancelots Institutions are commended for the Canon-Law, as Minsinger on Iu∣stinians Institutions for the Civil-Law. In the Body of the Canon-Law the Canons are sometimes diametrially opposite one to the other. Archidaconus, Panormitan, Innocentius, Rebuffus, were famous Canonists. Of Philosophy. It is either Natural or Moral, called Ethicks. Natural Philosophy De mundo, aut de iis quae sunt in mundo, quaerit. Pier Valer. Hierog. l. 38. c. 10. Tully cals Philosophy in his Offices, Studium sapientiae; in his Tusculanes, vir∣tutis indagatricem, expultricemque vitiorum.Socrates, Plato, Aristoteles tres viri constitu∣endae Philosophiae sine dubio divinitùs excitati. Casaub. Praefat. ad Theophrast. Charact. How many several sorts of Philosophers are mentioned? who were severed by
their distinct Schools, of Academicks, Peripatetiques, Stoicks, Epicures, Pytha∣goreans, too numerous to be rehearsed. Of all which, see Desiderii Iacotii De Phi∣losophorum doctrina libellum ex Cicerone.Philosophiae probè locatis fundamentis, fine quibus de Galeni senten∣tia, nemo medicus bonus dici potest, sedulam medi∣cis operam dedit. Melch. Adam. in vita Opsopaei. Aristotle was the Prince of the Peripateticks, Zeno the chief of the Stoicks, Epi∣curus of the Epicureans, and Pythagoras of the Pythagoreans. Philosophiam opti∣mè docebit Plato & Aristoteles, atque hujus Discipulus Theophrastus, tum utrinque mixtus Plotinus. Erasm. De Ratione Studii. As the Grecians for the title of wise men, called themselves lovers of wisdome, that is, Philosophos, so also the Doctors of the Jews often were not called wise men, but Scholars of wise men, that is, studious of wisdome. Ubi desinit Philosophus ibi incipit Medicus, ubi desinit Medicus ibi incipit Theologus. Ethicks or Moral Philosophy.Nominatur Ethica à Grae∣ca voce , id est, mos seu cōsuetudo, quia versatur circa hominum mo∣res, quapropter & latine sciontia moralis appellatur. Definiri potest, Scientia practica humanarum actionum quatenus in illis honestas locum habere potest. Walaei compendium Ethicae Aristotel. It is so called because it is conversant about the manners of men. The adequate object of it are humane actions, not considered any way, but as honesty hath place in them, and as they are capable of vertue. Dr Ames hath a Theological Disputation against it, and shews, that all Aristotles practical vertues are to be found in the Scripture. Physick. The subject of it is mans body, the end health. It is lawfull, it was before the promulgation of the Law, Gen. 50. 2. The Poets brought in Apollo, as the chief god of Medicine, to whom they have assigned Aesculapius for his sonne. Christ was a Physician both of soul and body. Omnibus est aliis Medicus praestantior unus. Is Homers verse. Physical Institutions are a llificium compounded out of the choisest flowers. A long series of times ha brought forth many famous Grecians, Physicians, some Latines, and some Arabians. Among the Grecians, Hippocrates and Galen excelled. Dioscordes also was a good Physician. Amongst the Latine Physicians Cornelius Celsus was the first. Of late Fernelius and Sennertus. Amongst the Arabians, AvicennaQui dele∣ctantur fusa & polydaedala varietate reme∣diorum, Avi∣cennam amplectantur: Cuncta enim hujus aevi remedia ex eo manant. Heurnii De studio medicinae bene Instituendo medit. Vide plura ibid. In plantis Hebraeis multùm debemus LXX interpretibus. Nam absque illis foret, & paucis Aquilae, Theodotionis, aliorumque fragmentis; non video, quid certi statuere possimus de multis plantarum vocabulis, quae in veteri instrumento se offerunt. Vossius De vitiis Sermonis, lib. 1. cap. 28., Rhazes, Averrhoes, Avenzoar, Mesue, Serapio, and Alsaharavius were chief. In Plants there is much difficulty. Vide Voss. De vitiis Sermonis l. 1. c. 28. Rondeletius, Matthiolus, Bellonius, Camerarius, Bau∣hinus, Spigelius, have done well about Herbs. Alexandria of old, and Padua of late, is famous for the Profession ofAmianus l. 22. pro omni experimento dictitat sufficere medico, si Alexandria se dixerit eruditum.

Theol. advorsus Ethicam. It is the highest part of all Philosophy from the subject of it, because it treats De causa altissima. Dr Ames hath a Theological Disputation against Metaphysicks, and saith, it is but an imaginary science.
Mr Baxter in his Reply to Mr Kendall, saith he hath above thirty Tracts of Me∣taphysicks by him, and seems to value Suarez, Schibler and Burgersdicis before all the rest. History.

Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci. Ferdinand King of Sicily, and Alphonsus King of Spain, recovered their health by reading of History, the first by reading Livy, the second by reading Q. Curtius. Some have observed, that the being versed in Books of History makes men wiser then in those of Policy, for that those furnish us with instances as well as rules, and as it were personate the rule, and draw it out more into the full lineaments. Mr Herles Morall prudence ch. 19. History is either 1. Ecclesiasticall, which handleth Church matters, and is for its Antiquity and Dignity to have the precedence. Vide Sixt. Senens. in Praefat. ad Lectorem in Bibliotheca Sancta. Or 2. Politicall, which handleth civil matters, in Kingdoms, States or Com∣monweals. Just or perfect History is of three kindes, according to the nature of the object which it propounds to represent; for it either represents a portion of time, or some memorable Person, or some famous Act. The first we call Chronicles or Annals; the second Lives; the third Relations. Of these Chronicles seem to ex∣cell, for celebrity and name: Lives for profit and examples: Relations for sin∣cerity and verity. Sr Francis Bac. Advancem. of Learn. l. 2. c. 7. The History of Times is either universall or particular: This comprehendsSemper lauda∣ta fuit histo∣ria: quae singularia facta aque res gestas no∣bis ostendens, cujuscunque temporis ac secuii exempla suppeditat: Nec unius regionis can∣cellis con∣stringitur; sed quam laè terrarum termini extenduntur, expatiatur.

Hujusmodi historiae itineraria audiunt: quae bona fide contexta hac prae reliquis praerogativa gaudent, quod majorem fidem mereantur, adeoque lectorem certiorem reddant, utpote quae ex  res gestas, casus ac eventa enarent. Constantini L'mpereur Epist. Dedicat. Ad Itinnerarium D. Benjaminis. the affairs of some Kingdom, or State, or Nation: That the affairs of the world. Amongst Histories Itineraries have the preheminence, when one shall faith∣fully relate the most memorable things he hath observed by travelling into many and strange Countries: And amongst Itineraries, that of R. Benjamin a Jew hath been very much esteemed by many, (saith Constantine L'Empereur) because he did not only travell over Europe and Africa, but professeth that he entred into the most inward and extream regions of Asia, where he witnesseth that he saw rare things and yet unknown to our world: and therefore his little book abundantly affords examples of very many things, so that it cannot but be read with delight. The first Law given to an Historian (saith Tully de Oratore) is Nequid falsi dicere audeat: deinde nequid veri non audeat; ne qua suspicio gratiae sit in scribendo, ne qua simultatis. The composing of a History consists in things and words: for things he must have respect to the order of time and the description of places, the manners, lives, counsels, sayings, deeds and events of men; for words, the kinde of speech must not be large, yet adorned with a pure and famous brevity.
T. Livius in the opinion of all Learned men is the Prince of Latine History,A Catalogue of some of the chiefest Histo∣rians. there are only two books of Salusts. Caesars Commentaries contain famous things but done in a few years.

Suetonius, Ta∣citus, Q.

The best Greek Historians (although some of them be imperfect) are Herodo∣tus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Polybius, Dionysius Halicarnasseus, Dion, Eusebius, and others.Vossius hath written an excellent book, De Historicis Graecis & Latinis.

The Epochae are to be observed. The Epochae are two fold. 1. Ecclesiasticall, which are noted in the Scriptures and Ecclesiasticall Hi∣stories; of which eleven as more famous are mentioned, from the beginning of the world, the Flood, the building of the Tower of Babel, Abrahams peregrinati∣on, the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt, the year of Sabbath, the year of Jubilee, Solomons Temple, the Babylonish Captivity, Daniels Seventies, the birth of Christ. The Christian Aera, that is, the way of numbering times from Christ being born, although it be most laudable, yet began lately, and hath not been long used in designing publick or private affairs. Helvic. in System. Chron. 2. Politicall, which are observed in prophane Histories, and are used in civil affairs. Of these some most famous are, 1. Of the Olympiads: which is of the Grecians. Olympias est spacium quinque annorum à Latinis Lustrum dictum, in the beginning of the fifth year the Olym∣pian games were wont to be celebrated, with great concourse of all Greece, so called from Olympia a City in Thessaly, in which those sports were exercised. This is the noblest computation of time among the Heathens. 2. Epocha urbis conditae, id est, Romae. 3. Est C. Iulii Caesaris, from whence the Roman Emperours are numbred.

Of Poetry. It is referred to the imagination, and is a kinde of Learning in words restrained;Vide Fulleri Miscel. Sac. l. 1. c. 20. & Spec. Arab. Iohan. Fabric. p. 170. ad 178. Eras. Epist. l. 9. Epist. 120. in matter loose. It is an art of deceit, which measureth expressions, not by the truth of the sub∣ject, but by the strength of imagination working upon it. It principally serves for venting extraordinary affections. Poetry is the quintessence or rather the luxury of Learning. The Originall of this Art is very ancient, and (as Euseb. l. 2. de praeparat. Evang.) first flourished with the most ancient Hebrews, who were long before the Poets of the Grecians. Moses made an exhameter Verse, wherein he gave thanks to God for their deliverance at the red Sea. David composed many Hymns. Quid Deutoronomii & Esaiae cantico palchrius? Quid Solomone gravius? Quid perfectius Iob? quae omnia hexametris & pentametris versibus apud suos composita decurrunt, Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum. l. 1. c. 8. Orphes (saith Porphyrius) first illustra∣ted this Art, then Homer and Hesiod. It is taken in a double sense, as it respects words, and so it is a kinde of chara∣cter of speech; for verse is a kinde of style and form of elocution, and pertains not to matter; for a true narration may be composed in verse; and a faigned in Prose. Or as it respects matter, so it is imitation of History at pleasure. It is either Narrative, or Representative, or Allusive.Sir Fran. Bac. Advanc. of Learn. l. 2. c. 13. Poetica ars multis me∣hercle de causis, reliquas antecellit disciplinas, vel quia homines nullam penè artem assequi possunt, nisi in illam diu incubuerint, ut quod scientias fere, ut Strabo in primo Geographiae adversus Eratosthenem pulchrè demonstrat, in se continet omnes: vel demum quod ex omni∣bus artibus, quae ab humani excellentia proficiscuntur, sola poetica divino furore percipitur. Nā poetae furore affii res omni admiratione & stupore dignas canunt, tuncque veri vates sunt, cum insniunt. Polyd. Verg. de Rer. In. l. 1. c. 8. Narrative is a meer imitation of History, but that often it extols matters above belief. Dramaticall or Representative, is, as it were, a visible History, it sets out the Image of things, as if they were present: History, as if they were past. Parabolicall or Allusive is History with the Type, which brings down the Ima∣ges of the understanding to the objects of sense. Because neither our senses are moved with extraordinary effects of Gods power,Poets were the first Priests, Prophets, Le∣gislators and Polititians, the first Philoso∣phers, Astrono∣mers, Historio∣graphers, Ora tors and Musici∣ans in the world. nor our mindes bent to observe the waies of his wisdom, so as we might be stricken with true admiration of them, we have fewer good sacred Poems, then of any other kinde. But as the Ancients chief learning did consist of Poetry, so the ex∣cellency of their Poetry was chiefly seen in the proper and native subject of this faculty, that is, in matters of sacred use or observation. Whence the title of Vates did descend to secular or prophane Poets, which retained the number and manner of speech used by the former. The Book of Psalms, Iob, and the Songs of Moses, are the only pattern of true Poesie. Dr Iacksons Comment upon the Apost. Creed, Vol. 1. c. 14. The Greek and Latine Poesie was by verse numerous and metricall, runningMetri origo à Deo optimo maximo est; qui hunc ter∣rarum orbem, & omnia ab eo contenta, certa ratione quasi metro dispo∣suit: harmo∣niam enim, ut Pythagoras docuit, in Caelestibus terrenisque rebus nemo hercle esse dubitat. Nam quo pacto mundus consisteret, nisi certa ratione & numeris praefinitis ageretur? Omnia quoque instrumenta quibus utimur, mensura quadam, id est, metro fiunt. Quôd si hoc in caeteris rebus accidit, quanto magis in oratione, quae cunctas complectitur? Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum, l. 1. 6. 9. Mirus gentium consensus in poëseos rhythmicae, itan vocant, amore. Nam omnes ferè populi Europae, Asiae, Africae, ab aliquot retro seculis non alios praeter istos versus norunt. Casaub. ad Pers. Sat. 1. upon pleasant feet, sometimes swift, sometime slow, (their words very aptly ser∣ving for that purpose) but without any rime or tunable concord in the end of their verses, as we and all other Nations now use. But the Hebrews and Chaldees, who were more ancient then the Greeks, did not only use a metricall Poesie, but also with the same a manner of rime, as hath been of late observed by Learned men. Our manner of vulgar Poesie is more ancient then the artificiall of the Greeks and Latines, ours coming by instinct of nature, which was before Art and observati∣on, and used by the wilde and savage people, who were before all Science or Civility▪
In the time of Charlemaine and many years after him the Latine Poets wrote in rime. The School of Salerne dedicated their book of Medicinall rules unto our King of England, beginning thus, Anglorum Regi scribit schola tota Salerni Si vis incolumem, si vis te reddere sanum Curas telle graves, irasci crede prophanum Nec retine ventrem, nec string as fortiter anum. All the rest go on in the same way, well to the purpose of their Art. One wrote these verses against the whole rable of Monks, O Monachi vestri stomachi sunt amphora Bacchi, Vos estis Deus est testis turpissima pestis. Hugobald the Monk made a large Poem to the honour of Carolus Calvus, every word beginning with C, which was the first letter of the Kings name thus, Carmina Clarisonae Caluis Cantate Camenae. There were 1. Heroick Poets, such as wrote long Histories of the noble acts ofMetrorum plura sunt ge∣nera, quae auctore Servio, vel à rebus quae descri∣buntur, nomi∣na accepere, ut heroicum, quod hexame∣trum: licet Moses pri∣mus usurpa∣verit, tamen quia Homerus, & caeteri qui deinceps secuti sunt, heroum res gestas hoc carmine scriptitarunt, heroi∣cum nominatum est. Polyd. Verg. de Invent. Rerum, l. 1. c 9. Vide plura ibid. Kings and great Princes, and the great matters of peace and warre, whereof Homer was chief and most ancient among the Greeks, Virgil among the Latines. 2. Lyrique Poets; quòd eorum ferè carmina ad sonum Citharae recitarentur. They delighted to write songs of pleasure, of which sort was Pindar. Anacreon and Callimachus, with others among the Greeks: Horace and Catullus among the Latines. 3. Elegiack, who wrote in a certain pitious verse called Elegy; such among the Latines were Ovid, Tibullus, and Propertius. 4. There were Comicall Poets who wrote Enterludes to recreate the people with matters of disport, of whom among the Greeks, Menander and Aristopha∣nesVide Polyd. Vergil. De Invent. Rerum l. 1. c. 10, & 11. In Tragaedia praecipue spectandi affectus, & quidem ferè▪ acriores illi.

Id. ibid. were most excellent; with the Latines, Terence and Plautus▪ and also Tragicall, who set forth the dolefull fals of unfortunate and afflicted Princes, such were Aeschyius, Euripides and Sophocles with the Greeks; Seneca among the Latines. Satyricall, who taxed the vices of the people in bitter speeches, such were Lucilius, Iuvenall and Persius among the Latines. Others were given wholly to scoffing at undecent things, and in short Poems uttered pretty merry conceits, and these were called Epigrammatists, as Martiall. Poets are drawn with a desire of glory, and are greedy of praise. Nec petitur sacris nisi tantum fama Poetis. There are Deliciae Poetarum, where the famous Italian, French, German andThere are also Flores Poeta∣rum, at the end of which is a defence of the Poets. Scotch Poets are mentioned.

Of Painting. Painting is silent Poetry, and Poetry a speaking Picture.Pictura muta poesis, poesis loquens pictu∣ra. Aristot. Rhet. l. 3. Scripturam picturam esse arguunt verba Graeca & Latina, quia  tam picturam significat quàm scripturam, & literae à ino, unde lineae. Bibliander de Ratione communi omnium Linguarum, c. 6. Pictura a co magno in honore apud veteres homines fuit, ut cum caeteros ferme omnes artifices bs nuncupatent, solum pictorem huic nuncupationi eximerent, ut innuit Leo Baptista Albertus l. 11. de Pictura.

Sir Francis Bacon in his first book of the Advancement of Learning, lib. 1 cap. 4. saith, The Sciences which hold more of the Fancy and of Belief, then of Reason and Demonstration, are chiefly three, Astrology, naturall Magick and Alchimy. I. For Astrology.Nam veteres omnes, ut hoc obiter mone∣am tyrones, Astronomia & Astrologia utuntur ut Synonimis. Plato ferè Astronomiae vocabulo utitur, Aristoteles Astrolo∣giae, per archaismum prisco & obsoleto more, ut vult Simplicius ad libros de caelo. Saul. sect. 2d. in Eclid. Though the Ancients generally confounded Astronomy and Astrology, yet they are to be distinguished, as the very Greek words shew. The Scripture, Psal. 19. commending the Sunne and the Starry Heavens forMr Burgesse his Treatise of Sin. Serm. 14. all its proper uses and ends that we should make of them, saith not the least word of Judiciall Astrology, or foretelling future events in the world, by them: where∣as if that were true which is said, that God by the Heavens as by a Book, hath revealed what he would do, it would have commended the study of the HeavensInsectatur hoc loco Propheta Iesaias ex ore Del, omnes Divinos, Ari∣olos, Aruspi∣ces, Astrolo∣gs, augures, Genethliac, Mathematicos, Planetarios, Pythones, denique omnes qui artem futura & abdita divinandi profitentur, sicut Orientales solebant. Omnibus enim iis atque aliis multis nominibus fuerunt hujusce divinatores, variis temporibus appellati: olim Chaldaei & Orientales, & Genethliaci: Augustim temporibus, Mathematici & Planetarii: nunc passim Astrologi vocantur & Neoromantici.

Bez Epist. 29. for this end to all; for if God have manifested his will by it, then certainly he would have commanded us to search for it there, as he doth command us to finde out his will in the Scripture. But the Scripture is so farre from commending such a study, that it expresly forbids it as a grievous sinne, Deut. 18. 10, 14. Isa. 2. 6. & 41. 23. & 44. 25. & 47. 2. I. 10. 2. Eccles. 10. 14. And that Ju∣diciall Astrology is a vanity, appeareth by this reason; They undertake to fore∣tell contingencies for the most part, from the position of the seven Planets:
Now there being so vast a number of fixed Stars, which have influence in earthly things in some proportion as well as the Planets, how is it possible that they should foretell any certain truth? One in Basill by his calculation noted a certain day which he mistrusted should be fatall unto him, by some thing which should at that time befall him. Where∣upon he determined with himself all that day to keep him sure and safe within his chamber, where he reaching up his hand to take down a Book, the Book fallingFoxes Act. and Monum. down upon his head gave him his deaths wound, and shortly after he died upon the same. Tycho Brahe in his Oration de Disciplinis Mathematicis, doth plead somewhatPraedictiones Astrologicae non solum à vulgo, quod omnes Artes aequali odio prosequitur: sed à quibus∣dam etiam eruditis homi∣nibus in du∣bium vocan∣tur: quamvis sola Artis ignorantia eos excusare possit. Pergunt enim Arti contradicere, cujus principia sums labris non degustarunt, & cum in aliqua cognitione excellunt, de omnibus aliis rebus quamvis ab ea cognitione longè dissitis, sibi judicium arrogant. Solus Picus Mirandula Astrologiae gnarus eam ex propriis Apoelesmatis cvellere aggressus est. Sed hujus objectionibus Lucius Bellonius erudito scripto jamdudum respondit. Et ipse Picas mortuus anno aetatis 33, quem tres Astrologi illi fatalem ex directione ascendentis ad corpus martis praedixe∣rant, Astrorum efficaciam, quam infringere voluit, nimis certo eventu, proprio interitu comprobarit. Tych. Brah. Orat. de Discipl. Mathem for Astrology. But Gassendus de Doctrina Epicuri, hath a Diatribe against Judiciall Astrology, and cals it ridiculous. Sixtus ab Hemminga wrote a Book against those which profess Astrology, which he entitled, Astrologia ratione & experientia refutata liber. He shews there, that all the promises which Astronomers make of future events are vain, and that evi∣dently in the genitures of thirty famous persons, which Suffridus Petrus de Scri∣ptoribus Frisiae reckons up. Another kinde of Divination is Physiognomy. If I say a sanguineous man is prone to lust, that is a true judgement, this is pro∣perlyIpsa nominis notatio signi∣ficat Philoso∣phis scientiam illam, quâ vel c totius cor∣poris, vel alterius partis corporis aspectu, de hominis natura & ingenio judicamus. Zanch. de Divinat. per sortes. Physiognomy, but if thou saiest, he is actually lustfull, that is a rash judge∣ment, for by reason or the grace of God he may restrain that, as the story of So∣crates is known. A certain kind of Physiognomy is called Chiromancy or Palmestry, which is aChiromantia quid sit, ipsius nominis nota∣tio indicat: Divinatio est, quae fit ex ma∣nuum inspecti∣one. In S. lite∣ris, ne verbum quidem ullum de Chiromantia habemus. Dico ex manuum inspectione verè & certè cognosci posse cùm corporis constitutionem, tum multorum affectuum propensionem.

Zanch. de Divinat. divination by inspection of the lines in the hand, —Frontemque manumque praebebit vati. Juv. Sat. 1. Aristotle in his singular book of Physiognomy hath made no mention of Chi∣romancy, yet I beleeve the Egyptians, who were addicted to those abstruse and mysticall sciences had a knowledge therein, to which those vagabond and coun∣terfeit Egyptians did after pretend, and perhaps retained a few corrupted prin∣ciples,
which sometimes might verifie their prognosticks. Dr Brown. Religio Medici. See of them Camerar. Histor. Meditat. l. 1. c. 17. II. Of Natural Magick.Magicarum artium usum inde coepisse inter homines existimo, quod Diabolus se∣cutus exem∣plum consue∣tudinis & colloquiorum Dei, cum san∣ctis Patribus, eodem modo alias alia specie sese exhibuit hominibus, ut hujus imitationis & colloquiorum occasione se facilius insinuaret, & à verbe Dei aversos animos, ad petendas à se, & expectandas declarationes, admonitiones, patefactiones, & alia hujus generis assuefaceret.

Zoroaster is said first to invent this Art of Magick. Vide Aug. De Civ. Dei. l. 21. c. 14. & Polyd. Verg. De Invent. Rerum. l. 1. c. 22. Magick flourished especially among the Persians. One saith, Magia est ars impetrandi à Diabolo quicquid ipsi praescripseris. Magick is an Art of obtaining of the Devil whatsoever thou shalt command him. As Christianity is an Art of obtaining from God what is profitable, so Magick is an Art of obtaining from the Devil what thou shalt command him. For the Devil is the Author and worker of those things which the Magicians work; though one saith, The Art is but Naturalis Philosophiae absoluta consummatio, the absolute per∣fection of natural Philosophy. Plinie speaketh of Moses his Myracles, though he do ill in calling him a Magi∣cian, for, 1. what likenesse is there between the illusions of a Magician, which vanish away in the twinkling of an eye, and the leading of a mighty great NationJannes and Jambres Ma∣gicians resisted Moses, 2 Tim. 3. 8. through the Sea, and which is more, the maintaining of them from hunger and thirst so long a time. There is no Law in the world doth so expresly forbid Magick as doth the Law of Moses, as if the Law would thereby purposely prevent this slander. Benno the Cardinal in the life of Hildebrand relates, that five Popes SylvesterDiabolicis artibus Sylve∣ster tertius Pontifex va∣sit. De quo Stella devitis Pont. in Sylv. III. Platina aliique.

The Jews hold, that Moses received a double Law from God in the Mount, one in writing, or delivered in writing, the other by mouth, or delivered by mouth. This last (say they) was successively delivered by Moses to posterity, first to Ioshua, by him to the Elders, and by them to the first Prophets, and then to the last Pro∣phets, amongst whom the last of all were Zachary, Haggai, Malachi, these de∣livered it to the men of the great Synagogue, which were Ezra with his company, who restored the Law to its ancient purity, from whom the wise men following re∣ceived it in succeeding generations, and this double Exposition which the Jews glo∣ry in is yet found among their wise men, they name the Cabala. Ioannes Picus de Mirandula first amongst the Latines made mention of this Ca∣bal of the Hebrews. Because there are six Alephs in the first verse of the first Chapter of Genesis, and Aleph signifies a thousand, therefore they say the world shall last six thousand years.

COnstat Graecos & Latinos peregrina linguae voces, dum suae linguae deco∣ro, & compositioni student, prodigiosè corrupisse. Leland. Comment. in Cign. Cant. Languages do often much change in processe of time. The French, Spanish and Italian, coming from the Latine are much fallen from the puri∣ty of the Latine tongue. None of the French will now understand the Laws of England published by William the Conqueror in the Norman without an Inter∣preter. Languages differ much in common names, but not in proper; all Languages say almost in the same manner, Adam, Abraham, Moses, David, Iesus, Socrates, Plato, Caesar, C. Caro, Carolus, and in the like. The Confusion of Languages was brought in at the building of the Tower ofPeccati poena est tot esse lin∣guas, Lud. Vi. de Trad. Dis∣cip. l. 3.

As the confusion of tongues at Babel had caused the casting off of the Gentiles,
by severing them from the participation of the true Religion (which was onely professed and known in the Hebrew tongue) so was the gift of tongues to be a needfull means to bring them into Religion again; when every one may hear of the things of God in his own Language. The Languages may be divided into Oriental and Occidental: 1. Oriental; Hebrew, Chaldee, Samaritan, Syriack, Arabick, Aethiopick, Persian, Armenian, Coptick. 2. Occidental; Greek, Latine, Spanish, French, Italian, German, English, and Scla∣vonick, which is spoken very generally. The Oriental tongues are written and read from the right hand to the left, ex∣cept the Aethiopick and Armenian. The Grecians at first did write forward and backward, whence that phrase, Li∣teras exarare and lineae, are called versus, and thence that was a most profitable andVide Bocharti Geog. sac. grave Decree of the Councel of Vienna, celebrated under Clement the 5th, That there should be in Universities publick professours of the Hebrew, Chaldee and Arabick tongues, which should teach them, and translate books out of them into Latine for the propagation of the Faith, and more easie conversion of the In∣fidels. Sigismundus Gelenius hath written Lexicum Symphonum. Quo quatuor Linguarum Europae familiarium, Graecae scilicet, Latinae, Germanicae, ac Sclavinica concordia judicatur.

He saith there, That there are a thousand original words of the Latine tongue, and themata bis mille linguae Hebraeae, two thousand roots of the Hebrew tongue. There are three principal or learned Languages, the Hebrew, Greek and Latine. I. Of the Hebrew. Of Languages, the Hebrew as it is the first and most ancient of all, so it aloneNostri etiam seculi omnes propemodum docti, primas linguae He∣braeae deferunt, excepto unico Goropio Be∣cano, qui Belgicam suam principem antiquitato asserere, sed frustra & admodum languide, allaborat.

It is most certain that the Hebrew langage from the beginning of the world to this present,  received any alteration or corruption in its dialect or manner of speech. See Jerom in his Preface to the Prophet eremiah, in his last Epistle to Paulus Urbicus, and in his Exposition on the third Chapter of Zephany. Reuchlin in his Book of the Iews Cabala. Augustinus Steuchus in his Annotations on the 37 Chapter of Genesis, and divers others quoted by Dret, Histoire Des Langues De cest univers. seems to be pure and sincere, all the rest almost are mixt: for there is none of them which hath not certain words derived and corrupted from the Hebrew. So the Latines have not onely borrowed many words of Art from the Grecians, but also of things which they found in their books. So the Latine tongue was corrupted by the Gothes in Italy, France and Spain. Some think that the English Language is most mixt and corrupt of all. Munster in the second Book of his universal Cosmography, saith, The English tongue is compounded of many Languages. In times past (he saith) it was pure Germane, as one may know by Beda, who was born in England. The Mysteries of God, and our salvation were delivered by God, and receivedHac Hebraica sive Judaica lingua quae & sacra dicitur. Vetus Testamentum conscriptum fuit.

The Punique tongue was the Canaanitish or old HebrewSee Brerewoods Enquiries, ch. 7. Language, that which was vulgarly spoken among the Jews before the Captivity. Amongst Christians for more then a thousand years from Christ, none scarce did adorn the Hebrew Language unlesse very few. The Jews were in such hatred, that their very Language was vilified. Origen of Alexandria learned it of a Jew called Hill, not without trouble, and the publick upbraiding of Celsus. Ierom also of Stridona a Monk and Presbyter, learned this Language at Bethlehem, espe∣cially in the night time of a Jew, fearing his Countreymen, whose name was Bar∣hanina, whence Ruffinus becoming his enemy objected to him, that leaving Christ he followed Barabbas, He neglecting that calumny went on stoutly, and taught many religious Virgins this Language, that they might sing Hebrew Psalms. After Ierom, who flourished in the year of Christ 385. followed Iohn Damascene, who li∣ved in the year of Christ, 730. Nicholas Lyra was converted from Judaism in the year of Christ, 320. Afterward Paulus Burgensis was converted from Ju∣daism. And this was the lot of that holy Language even unto the year of Christ 1440. when Printing was invented, and the studies of Languages and Learning began to flourish. Here among the Christian restorers of the holy tongue Reuclin was the first. He learned the Greek tongue of Greek exiles (amongst whom was Chalcondylas) and the Hebrew of the Jews, and he illustra∣ted both. The ice being broken by him, Hebrew Bibles were printed first at Pi∣sauna, after at Venice, and in Italy. Faelix Pratensis, Daniel Bombergus his master in the holy tongue, the Author and Moderator of his famous printing in the He∣brew, much adorned this Language, by publishing Hebrew Bibles, which are cal∣led Veneta & Bombergiana. Augustinus Iustinianus Nebriensis Episcopus put forth Psalterium octaplum. Petrus Galatinus flourished in Spain, also Franciscus Ximenes Archbishop of Toledo, and Cardinal, who procured the Edition of Opus Complutense, & Benedi∣ctus Arias Montanus Hispalensis, who being helped together with his Collegues by the munificence of Philip the second King of Spain, promoted that kingly work, the Spanish and Plantine Bible. In France Sanctes Pagninus Lucensis professed this tongue, The Author of the Treasury of the Hebrew tongue, Franciscus Vatablus, which incouraged and fur∣thered Robert Stevens in printing so elegantly the Hebrew Bible at the charge of Francis the first King of France. Iohn Mercer who together with Bonaventure Cornelius Bertram and Antonius Cevallerius inriched Pagnines Treasury with An∣notations. To these may be added William Postell and Nicholas Clenard, who travelled far out of their love to the Hebrew and Oriental tongues. In Germany after Capnio or Reuchlin, Conradus Pellican, Sebastian Munster, Iohn Oecolampadius, Luther, Aurogallus, Forster, Zigler, Iohn Albert Widman∣stadius, Andraeas Masius, Paulus Fagius, Iohn Avenarius, Iohn Drusius, Waser, Iohn Buxtor the Father and Sonne, George Cruciger, and others bestowed their pains to good purpose in this Language.

The Syriack and Chaldee are as it were but dialects of the Hebrew (differing not much more then Northern and Western speech from plain English) and though they be nearly allied to the Hebrew, yet they are nearer one to the other, insomuch that some reckon them both one. Those Christians are a terrour to the Jews who are indifferently skilled in the Thargum and the Rabbins, for they know that many pillars of Judaism are most vehemently shaken, yea overthrown in them. The more the pity that these most profitable studies are so neglected in those places where the Jews most resort. Many Christians in Syria use this Language in Grammaticis & sacris about the mountain Libanus. The Samaritan Language. It hath no other letters and characters proper to it, but the Hebrew letters andTotidem ver∣bis quot Ju∣daei, ne una quidem mi▪ nus, aut am∣plius, Penta∣teuchum legunt.

Temp. lib. 7. characters, yet most ancient. Many Jews at this day dwelling in Syria, and chiefly in the Town of Sichem, use this Samaritan Language, which are called Sama∣ritans. The Syriack tongue, which is very like to the Hebrew, witnesseth that the He∣brews have two and twenty letters, for they also have two and twenty in sound alike, but divers characters. The Samaritans also write the Pentateuch of Moses in so many letters; and it is certain that Ezra after the taking of Hierusalem, and the restauration of the Temple under Zorobabel, found out other letters which we now use, when to that time the characters of the Samaritans, and the Hebrews were the same.

The Syriack tongue is certainly thought to have had beginning in the time of the Captivity of the Iews in Babylon, while they were mingled among the Chaldeans. In which long revolution of seventy years, the vulgar sort of the Jews forgot their own language, and began to speak the Chaldee; but yet pronouncing it amisse, and framing it somewhat to their own Countrey fashion, in notation of points, affixes, conjugations, and some other properties of their ancient speech, it became a mixt Language of Hebrew and Chaldee. Brerewoods Enquiries touching the Diver∣sity of Languages and Religions through the chief parts of the world, ch. 9. Guido Fabricius clearly demonstrates the vulgar tongue of Iury in the dayes of our blessed Saviours pilgrimage here upon earth to be Syriack, which (saith Ma∣sius) grew out of the mixture of the ancient Chaldee and Hebrew, and was so dif∣ferent from the latter, that the one could not be understood by the other.

It is an elegant Language whether we consider the plentie of words, and the force of signification, or the sweetnesse of the phraseology, or the facility and gravity of the whole Language. All these particulars Erpenius proves in his first Oration. De Ling. Arab. and Mr Greaves saith, it exceeds both the Greek and Latine in number of words. 4. It is a profitable Language. He that hath the knowledge of this Language,Vide Pocock. Not. Miscel▪ in portam Mosis. may travell without an Interpreter almost all over Africa and Asia. There are many words in the Hebrew Bible, and the most ancient and profitable Chaldee Translation of it, and many manners of speaking whose signification and sense cannot be had but out of this Language. Without the knowledge of this Lan∣guage, how shall the impious opinion of Mahomet be either fully known or refuted? It gives great light to the Syriack, Aethiopick, Persian, and other Languages,Nulla, mi Lector, lingua est (Graecam & Latinam excipio) quae plu a solidae eruditionis & encyclopaediae monumenta continet.

Poetarum illis seges densissima est, ut nullibi terrarum major ingeniorum messis provenerit, saith Mr Greaves in his Oration. He commends it also for its facility, for here are no dialects at all, no turnings of flexions, no anomalies. Mercer, Ioseph Scaliger, Francis Rophelengius, Isaac Casaubone, Emanuel Tremelius, and Francis Iunius, Clenard, Golius, and our Pocock and Graves highly prized this Language, and promoted the study of it. The Arabians (saith Bedwell) translated the Syriack Testament not the Greek, as it will appear by many places to him that shall compare them, whence those things which are very well rendred by the Syriack, are also rendred ad verba by the Arabick, where the Syriack hath erred, there also the Arabick hath much more missed the mark. Of the Ethiopick or Indian Language. It is so near (saith Bibliander, De Ratione Communi omnium linguarum, cap. 2.)Graeci Aethio∣piam dicunt ab , uro, &  visus, fa∣cies, solis enim vicinitate in∣colae ejus regionis ita torrentur, ut atro sint colore, adeoque immutabili, Ier. 13. 20.

Postellus. to the Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabick, that there is scarce any diction which is not found in some of them. The Ethiopians are descended from Chus the sonne of Cham. It proceeds almost wholly from the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriack and Arabick. They write from the left hand to the right. It hath a great passage through all the Kingdom of Ethiopia and Africk, which is of great extent. Some think the Pro∣phets
were written in the Ethiopick tongue from the times of our Saviour Christ, and his Apostles, and that the Eunuch (who was Treasurer under the Queen of Candace) read it, by which Eunuch also afterward all Ethiopia was converted to the faith of the Gospel. Of the Persian Language. There are many footsteps of the Persian Language in the Scripture, especiallyHac de Lin∣gua nihil pror∣sus possideo, sed eandem jam excolere coepit vir aliâs excellentissi∣mus in Linguis Anatolicis, Dn.

The Old Testament was translated out of Hebrew into Greek, and the New Testament was wholly written by the Apostles in this Language. Many Greek Fathers also have commented on the Scripture, or defended Religiou by Theolo∣gical Treatises. Grammatica, Dialectica, Rhetorica, Arithmetica, Musica, Geo∣metria, and many Chronological words have come from the Greek. Many terms in the Mathematicks cannot be understood without it. The Greeks in their Liturgie have no Latine speech, but the Latines have divers Greek speeches in theirs. An evident proof, that the Latines have received of the Greeks the Christian Religion, and have been their Disciples. As this appears by the History of the Acts of the Apostles, where we may see the Christian ReligionAnatomic De La Messe, l. 5. c. 14. passed from Syria to the Greeks, and from the Greeks into Italy, and to Rome. Thence it comes, that the most part of words used in Religion amongst the we∣stern Christians are Greek, as those of Christ, Church, Apostle, Evangelist, Ba∣ptism, Eucharist, Bishop, Deacon, Exorcist, Monk, Letany, Antiphonie, Chrisme.

By the pains of Theodorus Gaza, Luscaris, Musrus, Cretensis, Chalcondiles, Argyropylus, Trapezuntius, Chrysoloras, the Greek tongue was wonderfully spread. Sthwartzerd was called from the Greek Melancthon, Newman, Neander, Church∣yard, Polyander, Freeman, Luther, , Reuclin, Capio. The Germane tongue hath many words purely Greek, as Neander in the first part of his Geography shews.

So hath the English also divers words from them, as I have elsewhere de∣clared.
All Learning and Wisdom is contained in the Greek Language.Quia verò in Graeca lingua suavissima, dulcissima, elegantissima, & ornatissima omnis erudita doctrina & sapientia fuit tradita, cum Deus in illa gente, quicquid literatum, artium, doctrinae ac sapientiae literatae uspiam esset, deposuisset, caepit illa lingua propagari, tum per Graecorum colonias, tùm etiam aliis rationibus per omnes fere gentes omnium partium orbis terrae adeò ut non modo Scythis, Indis, quod ex Philostrato patet, sed Germanis etiam quod Willichius in Commentariis suis eruditis in Cornelium Tacitum annotavit.

Epist. 1. It is one of the three Learned Tongues, in comparison of which all others are said to be barbarous. Some hold that the flourishing, pure and incorrupt age of the Latine Tongue was from Terence, even to the times of Quintilian. This age had Terence, Pacuvius the Poet, Lucretius and Archias Poets, Varro, Cicero, Iulius Caesar, Virgill, Horace, Propertius, Tibullus, Catullus, Ovid, Salust, Columella, Livy. Quintus Curtius, Persius, Seneca, Silvius Italicus, and Martiall. Under Augustus Caesar the Latine tongue was most pure. Vide Becmanni Manuduct. ad Ling. Lat. c. 6. concerning the pure Latine Au∣thours, and c. 7. what Authours are most to be read, and also some Elogies of the Latine Tongue by divers Learned men. Pasquier Recherches de la France l. 9. c. 29. reckons up the Authours which ex∣celled in the Latine Tongue. The Latine Tongue grew to perfection by certain degrees, and in Caesar and Cicero's times (whereof the one for purity, the other for copiousness were the best that ever writ) it came to the highest flourish together with the Empire. Among the Poets, Plautus, Naevius, Accius, Pacuvius, Ennius and Virgill most refined it, among the Orators and Historians M. Cato, Sisenna, Caesar and Cicero. The Spanish Writer of the Book which is called the Triall of Wits, ch. 4. col∣lects thence, that there is a speciall agreement of the Latine Tongue with the rea∣sonable soul, because mad men which never learned Latine, nevertheless sometime speak it of their own accord. The Latine Tongue is usefull for all ArtsLingua La∣tina non uni vel arti, vel genti servit: sed omnibus quaecunque sunt, ubicun{que} sunt, & artibus & generibus.

Iulius Scaliger and Ioseph his sonne hold, that the Originals of the Latine speech are many of them drawn from the Greek. Crinesius de Confusione Linguarum cap. 10. proves by many instances, that the Latine Tongue proceeded from the Hebrew. It is very commendable to speak good Latine freely, and to write in a pure and elegant style. That is much which Fanchimus Fortius RingelbergiusPostremo animum ad∣junxi ad curā Latinè ac po∣litè scribendi, cujus gloria inter humanos conatus omneis summum tenere locum videtur.

One of the Councels cals the French Tongue Linguam Romanam rusticam, whence Romances, because they were written in that Tongue. The genuine pronunciation and reading is the most difficult in the French Tongue, for many letters which are written, are not pronounced, or otherwise pronounced. Crinesius in his Discourse of the Confusion of Languages, c. 10. gives seven ge∣nerall rules of the French pronunciation, and many speciall ones. There are many severall Dialects of the French Tongue.

That the Propheticall and Apostolicall Writings might be preserved in them, from corruption or destruction, which is the cause why Libraries were alwaies wont to be added to these Schools, in which other Books being written out faith∣fully in Hebrew, Greek, and Latine were kept. 2. That there might be perpetuall witnesses in Schools which might testifie by
a continuall succession, what Books were truly Canonicall and what Apo∣cryphall. 3. That these Schools might also testifie what was the native and genuine sense of such Writings, and what doctrine was truly Apostolicall. The last cause was, That from those Colleges those might be drawn out which were indeed fit to teach others, and to govern Churches. The whole Kingdom of Israel was filled with Theologicall Schools, according to the commandement of God. Samuel was the first builder of Colledges that we reade of, he called his Col∣ledge Najoh, that is, even beauty it self. In Ramah the Prophets dwelt with the Students, which were called Sonnes of the Prophets. Amos saith, I am not a Pro∣phet, nor the sonne of a Prophet, that is, I was never taught in the Schools of the Prophets, and the Learned. They had Schools amongst the people till the destruction of Ierusalem. TheVide Alting. Hist. Academ. Hebr. Jews being dispersed among other Nations, alwaies endeavoured to keep their Schools, which they called Synagogues, which were Colledges, as it were, in which the Law of God was interpreted among the more Learned, and wherein they con∣ferred and disputed about the Scriptures, Act. 6. 9. In Ecclesiasticall Histories we may see this care of the Apostles and their Disci∣ples in setling Schools every where where Churches were built, and in setting overCertè honesta professorum stipendia, non minus nervi sunt Schola∣rum, quam pecuniae belli.

Ante omnia, (saith he) futurus orator, cui in maxima celebritate & in media Reipublicae luce vivendum est, assuescat jam à tenero non reformidare homines, neque illa solitaria & velut umbratili vita pallescere.

Immediatly after Schollars come to the University, they are matriculated, andMatricularii vocabantur, quorum nomi∣na Matriculae inscripta.

They are called Undergraduates till they receive a degree, after Graduati, or in better Latine, In gradu aliquo dignitatis constituti.
The first degree with us is that of Bachelor of Arts, which they cannot attainBaccalaureus baccis lauri compositus puratur, sed potius corru∣ptum censeo ex batualitus: ut sit à batu∣endo, ex quo batailie. Batua∣lij verò fuerint vocati, quia jam quasi batuissent cum adversario, ac manus conseruissent: hoc est, publicè disputasserent, atque ita peritiae suae specimen dedissent. Vossius De vitiis  ermonis l. 1. c. 19. usually before four years standing, or near it. Three years after they may (if they be sufficient Schollars) take the Degree of Masters of Arts, which are Doctors, as it were of the Arts, and therefore a Master of Art takes place of a Doctor of Musick, because he is Doctor but of one Art. Seven years after they are Masters of Arts they may take the Degree of Bache∣lors of Divinity, and five years after, they may Commence Doctors of Divinity; so that they are almost of twenty years standing before they take that highest Degree. Of the Ceremonies used in creating of Doctors, Dr Prideaux speaks sufficiently in his Lectures. Alsted in his Encyclopaedia, l. 24. c. 13. and Iunius in Academiis, handle the Uni∣versities after the Alphabeticall order of the severall Countries, and so beginning with Anglia, they first mention Oxford and Cambridge, then they mention Bohe∣mia, and in it Prague; then Denmark, in it Hafna; then France, in it Alsted mentions sixteen Universities; then Germany, where he rehearseth twenty five Universities; then Spain, there he reckons up twenty two Universities; then Italy, there eleven; three in Polonia, and three in Scotland. Iunius speaks of Lusitania before Polonia, where he mentions Conimbra. Leukenor (our Coun∣tryman) in his Discourse of Universities, first begins with Germany high and low, and so goes on with Italy, France, Polonia, Prussia and Lituania, Bohemia and Moravia, Spain, England and Scotland. Middendorpius mentions them in this order, Italy, Sicily, Germany, Polonia, Spain, England, Scotland. CHAP. VIII. Of the Universities of Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. I Shall follow Leukenors method, (who is much beholding to Middendorpius and Neander) beginning with Germany, and ending with England, Scotland, and Ireland. I might speak also of the famous University of Athens, the Greece of Greece,Vide Neandri Geog. partem Iam.

In this City was erected an University by Christian Earl of Oldenburge, in the
year of Salvation 1478. after he had gained the Regal Diadem. For the which he obtained at the hands of Pope Sixtus the 4th the priviledges of Bononia. This Academy was afterward augmented and enlarged by King Christian the 3d, in the year 1498. and after him by Frederick the 2d, in the year 1549. When Tycho Brahe was past twelve years old, his Uncle sent him to Hafnia theGassend. l. 1. De Tychonis Brahei vita.

Hence there are so many Universities in Italy, as Rome, Ve∣nice, Padua, Bononia, Ferrara, Millan, Pavia, Turim, Florence, Pisa, Sienna, Medena, Naples, Salern. Here flourished the famous Oratours, Cicero, Hortensius and Antonius; the renowned Historians Livie, Tacitus and Salust; the memorable Poets, Virgil, Ovid, Catullus, Tibullus and Propertius; Plautus and Terence the Comedians; the Satyrists, Horce, Iuvenal and Persius, Aeneas Silvius afterwards Pope Pius the 2d, Marsilius Patavinus, Petrarch, Angelus Politianus, Rodolphus Volaterra∣nus, Picus Mirandula, Guido Bonatus, Ariosto and Tasso, Sixtus Senensis, Bellarmine, Baronius, were Italians.

It was so named from Romulus who layed thereof the first foundation. Nauclerus writeth, that Urbane the 4th of that name, being Pope, was much grieved to see the course of Studies in the Roman Academy intermitted, and all good discipline neglected: wherefore immediately he caused to be sent for that fa∣mous and most learned Clerk Thomas of Aquine, to direct and govern it, who set∣ting aside all care and respect of worldly promotion, applied his minde wholly to reform, restore and adorn the same: during which time, at the Popes intreaty he did write many excellent Commentaries upon divine and humane Philosophy. Pope Innocent the 4th ratified this University. Pope Clement the 5th in a Councel held at Vienna, ordained, That at Rome, or wheresoever the Pope in person should be
resident, the Hebrew, Chaldee and Arabick tongues should publickly be taught. Pope Eugenius the 4th much adorned this Academy. Pope Nicholas the 5th, being himself a learned Prelate, highly favouring allAelian, Grego. ry the great, Aulus Gellis, Laurentius Valla, Aldus Manutius, and his sonne, Antonius Sa∣bellicus were Romans.

I. ibid. learned men, did more labour in repairing and beautifying this glorious Academy then any of his Predecessours. Pope Leo the 10th exhibited liberal pensions to several learned men, which by their pains and industry upheld the glory of this renowned Academy. He sent into Turky for Iohn Lascaris, who robbing all the Heathen Universities of their best and worthiest Authors, did therewith plentifully furnish and adorn the Roman Libraries. Sixtus the 4th builded in the Vaticane that famous and renowned Library, called Palatina. Venice.

Iohannes Rovennas taught in Venice, from whom issued many excellent wits, which restored Schools and Discipline. After the Latine Tongue was again restored, Emanuel Chrysoloras began to teach the Greek.

This University was first founded (say some) when Theodosius swayed the Sce∣pter of the Roman Empire, though others doubt of it. Pope Gregory the 9th, Pope Boniface the 8th, and Pope Iohn the 23. writing sun∣dry learned Treatises, did dedicate them all to this University. Pope Clement the 5th in a Councel held at Vienna, decreed, That besides the study of all the liberal Arts, the Hebrew, Arabick and Chaldean Languages should be there publickly taught. The Civil Law is much studied here, insomuch that from hence proceeded the fa∣mous Civilians. Iohannes Andreas professed in this Academy the Law with great fame and esti∣mation. Azo that bright shining lamp of Learning was here also a publique Professour of the Civil Law. Io. Antonius Maginus was publick Professour of the Mathematicks.

He entertain∣ed also in his house Marcilius Ficinus a Platonick Philosopher, him he entirely loved. This Academy was afterward by Lawrance De Medices his sons sonne, finished and brought to a full, absolute and flourishing perfection. This Laurence was a great lover of good Letters, he held Marsilius Ficinus (whom his grandfather had caused to come to Florence) in great esteem. He nourished in his house that excellent Scholar Angelus Politianus, who in his youth did first make the Grecian Poet Homer speak in the Latine Tongue. He entertained with liberal pensions and exhibitions, Demetrius Chalcondylas,Florentinus etiam fuit Franciscus Guiccardinus eruditissimus, ac facundissi∣mus scriptor, qui tum alia scripsit, tam etiam sui tem∣poris historiam eluobavit libris riginae.

Pope Paulus the third, although he daily heard in the Roman Academy, Pompo∣nius Laetus, a man excellently learned, yet was he exceedingly desirous to study in the Florentine University, because the Greek and Latine Tongues, together with the other Arts, were there professed with greatest sincerity and profound∣nesse. This Prince much augmented, and with great cost adorned the Library which his Grandfather Cosmus had erected near the Temple of St Mark: from whence of late time have been brought to light many excellent books, which long have lain obscured, and were to be found in no other place of Christendom, as Eusebius Caesariensis, Hierocles, and the works of Clemens Alexandrinus, and others. Another Library was in this City erected at St Laurence his Church, by Pope Clement the seventh. Pisa. A University was erected here about the year 1339. Not long after it began exceedingly to flourish, as appeareth by the many grave and reverend Doctors, which therein received their instruction and education, viz. Pope Eugenius the 3d. Also Raimerus and Bartholomeus, two deep and pro∣found Scholars of the Order of the Friers Predicants, whereof the one did write that egregious work of Pantheology: the other set forth The Summe of Cases of Conscience. There have been learned Professours in this University, Felinus Sandaeus, Franciscus Aretinus, who was held to be the most judicious Civil Lawyer of his time. Bartholus after be had proceeded in Bononia, did in the Pisan Academy (as him∣self
confesseth) publickly professe the Civil-Law, Cosmo de Medices restored again this Academy, which in his time was exceedingly decayed. After him Laurence his Nephew so much adorned and augmented the same, that Volaterranus and Machiavel name him as the first Founder and Erector thereof. Sienna.

Petrus Ancoranus confesseth, that himself being sent for by the Councell of Sienna, in the year 1357. did in this University three years publickly professe the Civil-Law. In the time of Pope Iohn the second all manner of studies exceedingly flourished there. Panormitanus, Paulus Castrensis, Bartholomeus, Socinus, Philippus Decius, Hngo Senensis, and many others of great learning, did adorn this renowned Aca∣demy. In this City was born Aeneas Silvius, who afterward was Pope Pius the 2d, by whose bounty and benevolence this Academy was adorned with many priviledges. Francis Picolominy, after Pope Pius the 3d, and Sixtus hence sirnamed Senensis the greatest Scholar of the three, if not of all the age he lived in. There is a Colledge in it called Domus Sapientiae.

Poictiers is the Metropolis of the Earldom of Poictou, for Antiquity, not infe∣riour to any Town of France, second to Paris, onely in greatnesse, power and majesty. In this City hath long flourished a most learned University, for the Civil-LawAndreas Tir∣aquellus was Governour of it. chiefly, of great fame and authority in degree and preheminence next to Paris. Scaliger in his Cities thus speaks of it, Si studium est animae: veniunt à corpore vires; Galliaque à meritis poscit utrumque sibi: Hac studiis, aliae belli exercentur amore. Pictavium est animus, caetera corpus erunt. It was erected under Charles the 7th King of France, and confirmed by Pope Eugenius the 4th. We read in the Ecclesiastical Histories, that St Hilary called the Apostle of A∣quitaine, first revealed unto this people the light of the Gospel, and became the first Bishop of Poictiers, his excellent writings sufficiently testifie his singular wisdom and learning.
Ioannes Epnion and Christophorus Longolius were Professors here. Lions. The Arms of the City are a Lion, whence the name of the City in FrenchLugdunum. Anno Dom. 830. Lyon. In this City flourished an Academy of great fame and celebrity, which hath sent forth into the world many excellent men, renowned for their great learning and holinesse of life, as Irenaeus and Euherius both Archbishops of Lions.

Others will have it to be founded in the year 1362. at which time Casimire erected Cracon in Polonia. It flourisheth in the study of the Latine especially. Henry Valoise Duke of Aniou, brother to King Charles the ninth, not long since with much industrious care, laboured to augment and restore the same: the which good work that he might the better perform, he with great mu∣nificence invited thither sundry excellently learned Scholars: amongst the which was Francis Baldwin, who therein to his everlasting memory did establish the pro∣fession of the Civil-Law. Bodine came out of this University. Avignion. I is an ancient City of Prouuence, situated on the bank of Rhodanus, wherein is an University of long continuance. Pope Iohn the 22. transferred the Apostolick seat from Rome unto this City, after whom it remained there 74 years, or thereabout. The City and Church of Avignion are at this day immediately subjected to the Popes of Rome, who first became Lords thereof, by means of a certain Neapolitane Queen, who being indebted to the Church of Rome, resigned this City to the Bishops thereof, and his Successours for ever.

Some ancient Historiographers write, that the foundation of this City was laid by Aurelian the Emperour, in the year 276. and from him was called Aure∣lia, which name unto this day it retaineth. Others say, it was onely enlarged by him. In this City was erected an University by Philip le Beau King of France, in the year from our Saviours Nativity 1312. wherein the Civil-Law is with such learning and admiration professed, that this Academy hath been often of grave and learn∣ed Writers, entituled the nurse or mother thereof.

It is a City in France of great fame, rich, spacious, and much frequented. Some say, it was called Byturus quasi Bituris, from two ancient Towers, which they affirm to have been in this City erected by two brethren, which there together raigned.

It was authorized and endued with many great priviledges and high prerogatives by Pope Paulus the 2d of that name. Here Alciate, Rebuffus, Duarenus, Hotoman, Bonellus and Cuiacius (famous Lawyers) lived and taught with great applause. Cane. An University was erected at Cane in Normandy, upon this occasion. HenryAcademia Cadomensis. the 5th King of England, who subdued the Kingdom of France, and left the title to his posterity after many great and glorious Conquests atchieved against the French King, he at last bereaved him of Normandy, in the year 1418. In token and memory of which victory, as an eternal Trophy and Monument of his glory, he caused to be laid in Cane the foundation of this University. The Archbishop of Dublin was the first Reader of Divinity there. Here now lives Bochart the learned French Divine. Rhemes. It is a goodly City, and the Metropolis of Champaigne, wherein not long since was erected an University by the Prince Charles Guise, Cardinal of Lorain, Arch∣bishop and Duke of Rhemes, whose glory and renown daily more and more encrea∣seth, by reason of the Arts so learnedly there professed. S. Remigius was Bishop of this City, a man of holy conversation, and excel∣lently learned, as it evidently appeareth by the Commentaries which he wrote upon the Old and New Testament. He baptized Clodovaeus a mighty and puissant King of France, together with Choisdis his wife, daughter to the King of Burgundy, he died in the year 498. The French Kings are anointed at Rhemes with the oyl wherewith St Re∣migius
had anointed Clodoveus the first Christian King of France. Burdeaux. It is the head City of Aquitane.

Pope Iohn the 22 was the first Institutor of the University therein, which as it was erected not long after Paris, so doth it enjoy the same priviledges that here∣tofore have been granted to Paris. There was said in times past to have been in this City a Temple, wherein were commonly reserved in secret vaults and dungeons under ground, as Possi∣donius saith, 15000 talents of gold, which if any man had taken, he shortly after came to some unfortunate end: From whence proceedeth the Proverb, applied commonly to those whose attempts are ever unfortunate and without success, Au∣rum habet Tolosanum.

Some think they pronounce the a too little, and the i too big and broad. Caius in his Book De pronuntiatione Graecae & Latinae linguae, saith, that he learned by experience that variety of pronuncing did hinder mutuall commerce, mens society and understanding of things. He saith, that a Greek Patriarck be∣ing at London in the Reign of Edward the 6th, did not understand Sir Thomas Cheeke, nor Sir Thomas him, the Knight using the new kinde of pronouncing, the other the old: he addes, pleading for the old and barbarous pronunciation, Quo omnes Graeci ad huc utebantur cum ego essem Venetiis, tum è Cathedra Graecas literas profitendo, tum in templis sacra celebrando. Audiebam enim data opera saepius. At si ego tacerem norit Oxoniensis schola, quemadmodum ipsa Graecia pronunciarit, ex Matthaeo Calphurnio Graeco, quem ex Graecia Oxonium Graecarum literarum gratia produxerat Thomas Wolsaeus, de bonis literis optimè meritus Cardinalis, cum non alia ratione pronunciarit ille, quàm qua nos jam profitemur.

Those Schools of Learning which we call Academies or Universities, that Age termed Studia; that is, Studies. St Hierom termed the Schools of Gaul, Studia florentissima. The name of University was taken up about the time of King Henry the 3d, for a publick School. There are but three Latine Writers (which I have met with) who have written generally de Academiis, Iunius, and Middendorpe, and another intituled, Acade∣miarum quae aliquando Fuere & Hodie sunt in Europa, Catalogus & enumeratio brevis.

He begins with England, and therein with Oxford, and saith of it, Academia Oxoni∣ensis vulgò Oxford, quam instituit Aluredus, Saxonum Rex, Anno Christi 872. Posteà vero ex multorum Principum & Praeslum beneficentia, amplissimis structuris, re∣ditibus & privilegiis ornatur: habetque jam Collegia XVI, aulas etiam VIII, sin∣gula
aedificiorum splendore magnificentissima, ac bonarum literarum artiumque omni∣um studia florentissima. Cantabrigiensis, vulgò Cambridge, in qua primum Colle∣gium instituit Batsomus, Elinsit Episcopus, Anno 1274. Habet jam Collegia XI, Aulas etiam IV, eaque omnia aedificiorum celebritate praestantissima. Habuit etiam ante Scholam publicam peragustam (in qua Philosophia, humanio oresque disciplinae tradebantur) à Sigeberto, Estanglorum Rege constitutam, Anno 637. Yet it is the opinion of some, that the University of Oxford was rather restored then first Founded by King Alured, Anno 806. after it had been over-born a while by Danish furies. Middendorp in his 3d Book de Academiis, where he speaks of the Universities of England, saith, Inter harum duarum Academiarum professores gravis & acerba nu∣per controversia exorta est, dum singuli suam Academiam & antiquiorem prioremque tempore, & praestantiorem existere asseverant, & varias pro sua quisque sententia rationes, diversaque argumenta producit, ut difficile sit homini externo, terra ab iis marique disjuncto, suum judicium interponere. But after counsell given to them, toQuid profue∣rit si haec illa antiquior fu∣erit Academia, modo haec illi virtute par sit. Puerorum est de locorum praestantia & dignitate con∣tendere, & inanium verborum contentione & dissidio animos vulnrare. Caius de Antiquit. Cantab. Acad. l. 1. Dr Arrowsmiths modesty and ingenuity I approve of, who in a speech at Cambridge-Commencoment the last save two, had this passage, Cantabrigia, Oxonium. Oxonlum, Cantabrigia. endeavour rather to excell each the other in diligence, faithfulness and wisdom, and not to stand so much upon antiquity, and multitude, or excellency of Col∣ledges, which belong more to the glory of the dead then the living, he concludes at the last thus, Porrò utramque hanc Academiam, veterem quidem atque florentem reperio, Can∣tabrigiensis tamen, quantum hactenus deprehendere licuit, tempore prior & antiquior est. Ideoque ab ea principium ducam. But Learned Sir Isaac Wake in his Rex Platonicus p. 217. saith thus, Haec ipsa Antiquitatis lis, publico jam nuper totius Regni conventu Parliamen∣tario, ex antiquissimorum Historicorum fide examinata est & determinata, & prae∣cedentia Oxoniensi Universitati communi applausu omniumque suffragiis asserta. There he also addeth, p. 218. Iohannes Caius, vir fidei ut in rebus Religiosis, ita in Historicis nullius plane. He proceeds, Imò qui inter ipsos istius Scholae antiquitatem acerrimè tuentur, non asserunt tan∣tùm, sed & probant indubitatis argumentis Cantabrigiam, Generalem Artium & scientiarum Academiam factam & stabilitam non fuisse, ante vicesimum annum Edwardi tertii (hoc est nudiustertius ferè, si Aluredi seculum spectemus) quo Rege intercedente, apud Johannem Pontificem Romanum, Universitatis ibi stabiliendae privilegium iis est concessum ut Petrus de Ikham Monachus Ecclesiae Cantuar. scribit. Caius Middendorpii testimonio rem probat: Caii testimonio eandem probat Midden∣dorpius: sic manus manum, & falsarius falsarium fricat. Quin potiùs suam opor∣tet agnoscere ignorantiam, qui de exterorum rebus scribit, quorum res gest as nunquam legerit. Imò Middendorpi (tibi clam in aurem dico) agnosce impudentiam tuam, qui it a confidenter scribis de Academiis, ac si in omnibus aetatem totam vixisses, ita tamen frigidè, futiliter, indoctè, ac si in nulla unquam vel diem unum posuisses. Wake ibid. The third who writes of all the Academies of Europe saith, Ac libens optarim ne digladientur nimis & naenias mittant, qui hanc aut illam Acadmiam contendunt esse antiquiorem. Sint Arcades ambae, utraeque florentes, lu∣cem sole clariorem sibi invicem alternantes.There is a Ma∣nuscript of Ro∣bert Burhils in Oxford Library, De Britanniae rebus Scholasticis inverse, consisting of ten Books. The sixth book is termed Elfreda, de urbe Oxonia quam Elfreda insedem Academiae deligendam suadet. The seventh book is styled Parallelismus de Antiqui∣tate utriusque Academiae Oxon. & Cantab. wherein he asserts the antiquity of Oxford, but saith, Non est quod Can∣tabrigiensis Academia hanc suam originem etsi seriorem erubesceret. Primo, cum nec operae pretium sit contendere. Secundo, nec leves interim calamitates dum nondum exorta esset Cantabrigia, Academiam Oxoniensem nostram exceperint. Tertio, & antiquiora ferè incultiora, Academiis vix tandem Monastica fece expurgatis. And after he hath this passage of Cambridge: Haec est illa Academia antiqua, & celebris, quae non modò Oxoniensi florentissimo. Anglorum Gymnasio, sed & aliis Eu∣ropaei
orbis Academiis antiquioribus facilè posset adaequari. He speaks also very honourably of Oxford, and I have cited something out of him to that purpose. Sir Thomas More saith in an Epistle to the University of Oxford, Cantabrigiae, cuiEpistola Tho∣mae Mori ad Acad. Oxon. vos praelucere semper consuevistis. I know one, who is a very competent judge, because a most Learned Bishop, and well versed in antiquities, and also of an University in another Kingdom, who holds Oxford to be the ancienter. Oxford also hath been famous for Learned Scholars.Trithemius, Baleus, Le∣landus Oxo∣nienses ultra trecentos Cantabrigi∣enfes non plures uno supra centum & viginti scriptores in suis Catalogis commemorant. Brianus Twinus Antiq. Acad. Oxon. Mathematicians and Schoolmen, for the later there is no question, and I shall mention divers of them when I speak of Merton Colledge. For the first Roger Bacon, Bradwardine, Simon Bredon and Oddington were famous. The first ProfessorVide Gervas. Dorobernens. in Civil Law in England, viz. Vacarius, was of Oxford. Oxford lies in a Champion plain: It is a fair and goodly City, whether a man respect the seemly beauty of private houses, or the stately magnificence of publick buildings, together with the wholesom sight or pleasant prospect thereof. It is formed in the figure of a Cross, two long streets thwarting one another, each of them near a mile in length, containing in that compass thirteen Parish Churches, and a See Episcopall founded here by King Henry the 8th, Anno 1541. For the Stateliness of the Schools and publick Library andThere are many Pictures throughout the great Gallery adjoyning to the Library, of Learned men in severall Faculties. The Statutes of the University of Oxford at large are much commended. The select Statutes out of the body of them are printed and to be sold. Gallery, the bra∣very and beauty of particular Colledges, all built of fair and polished stone, the liberall endowment of those houses, and great incouragements of Industry and Learning in the salary of the Professors in most Arts and Sciences, it is (say some) not to be paralleled in the Christian world. Dr Iames hath set out two Catalogues of the publick Library in Oxford: One published in the year 1605, which mentions the Books Alphabetically di∣stinguished, according to the four Faculties.Clarissimus vir Thomas Bodleius qui vetustate, & temporum an hominum in∣juria Collap∣sam Univer∣sitatis Biblio∣thecam im∣mensis sum∣ptibus, conquisitis undine praeter omnes omnium generum codices excusos, manuscriptis, quantum in hoc spici∣legio licuit, compluribus vetustis optimae notae, instauravit. Savil. Not. in Chrysost. in Gen. Tom. 8. The other 1620. in which there is only a care had of the Alphabeticall order, by this more exact Catalogue one may readily finde any Authour, and all the Works of that Authour uno intuitu. If the Library be inferiour to the Popes Vaticane in sumptuous building, yet in Printed Books, if not in Manuscripts (there being many choice ones given by Sir Thomas Bodlie, and of late by my Lord of Pembroke, and Archbishop Laude, in almost all Languages) it may well contend with it for a Superiority. Reckon the number of Volumes in the publick Library, whereof the greatestHe mentions sixteen thousand in his Preface to his last Cata∣logue. part are in Folio, which amount to 11 or 12 thousands of divers Authours, the plurality of Languages, the diversity of Sciences, wherein these Books are writ∣ten, the condition of the Books whether written or printed, by Protestants or Pa∣pists, or any other, the use for six hours every day throughout the whole year, (Sundaies and Holydaies excepted) and we shall finde that the like Library is no where to be found. Dr Iames of the Corrupt. of Script. Counc. and Fath. part 5. In Oxford there are 18 Colledges endowed with Lands, besides 7 Halls, where Students live at their own charges in both of them. Professors of the Arts and Sciences, as also of Divinity, Law, Physick, and the learned Languages, with Liberall Salaries.
University Colledge, Founded 872. Alfred or Allured King of the West Saxons, being addicted to Religion and good literature, for the increase and study of Divinity, Philosophy and other Arts, in the 2d year of his reign founded this Colledge, by the name of University Colledge. George Abbat Archbishop of Canterbury was of this Colledge. Baliol Colledge, Founded 1262. Iohn▪ Baliol, born at Bernads Castle in the Bishoprick of Durham, (a worthyCollegium Baliolense gloriatur po∣tiù quòd Humfredum ducem Gloce∣striae, Henrici quarti filium virtutum me∣rito Bonum cognomina∣tum Acade∣miae nostrae lucidum atque patriae Sydus, nomen que nunquam oblinescendum educarit quàm quòd Cranmerum Archiepiscopum, Ridlaeum, Latimerum Episcopos, suis prae foribus (ut Eliam) ignes vehiculis coelum ptentes conspexerit.

Orial Colledge, Founded 1337.There are many guesses at the original of its name. King Edward the 2d erected it, it was so called because it was indeed a work which might beseem a King. Queens Colledge, Founded 1340. Robert Eglesfield Batchelor of Divinity, Chaplain to Queen Philippa, wife to King Edward the 3d, founded this Colledge in his own ground by the name ofCollegium Reginae nobi∣litatur duorum Principum, omnium, quos Anglia vidit, forti ssimorum educatione; videlicet Ed∣wardi Principis cognomento Nigri & Henrici Quinti elicissimi Regis.

England laid the foundation of a most ample and spacious Colledge, but he falling, his design failed with the Founder. Henry the eight enriched the same with many goodly revenues, annexing there∣unto Canterbury Colledge. It hath a spatious Court or quadrangle, nay divers, and a Hall both spatious and splendid, wherein is a most beautifull glasse Lanthorn, there is also a very fair Kitchin, which only, was finished by the Cardinal, and gave oceasion to that scoff of an outlandish man, Egregium opus (saith he) Cardinalis Collegium incepit, po∣pinam absolvit. Sanna vix è coquina deprompta adeo sale caret▪ saith Sir Isaac Wake in his Rex Platonicus. Peter Martyr was once Prebend of this Colledge, as his own Epistles shew, He writes thus, Amico cuidam in Anglia, Ego cum essem Oxonii vestibus illis albis in Choro nunquam uti volui, quamvis essem Canonicus, mei facti ratio mihi con∣stabat.

THis is the other University and eye of England, a most famous Storehouse of good Literature and Godlinesse; it standeth upon the River Cam, which di∣videth it into two parts, and hath a Bridge over it, whence arose the name Cam∣bridge.

Hugh Balsham Bishop of Ely in the year 1284. built the first Colledge, called Peter House, and endowed it with lands: whose example the other Founders did imitate and follow, saith the same Camden.

Out of Ireland came Caelius Sedulius a Priest.

He saith there, that the changing of the Popes names began, because Dutch men were made Popes, to whose names Roman ears were not accustomed, all that fol∣lowed observed the same use, signifying thereby that they had changed their pri∣vate affections into publick and divine cares. Platina saith Sergius the 2d was first called Os Porci, Swines mouth, and because of that filthy name he took the Name of Sergius when he was made Pope, and that that custom continued after, that those which were made Popes changed their names, although this was not observed by them all. Adrians memorable speech was, Nihil sibi imperio infelicius in vita accidisse▪ That nothing befell him more unhappy in his life, then his Dominion. He was severe and purposed to reform corruptions, and said he would begin with the Court, but was thereupon poysoned, as some think. Vide Sleid. Comment. lib. 3.

Hence the Emperour underwent a publick penance imposed upon him by the Bishop. He stoutly defending the Catholick Faith and Ecclesiasti∣cal Discipline, converted many Arians, and other hereticks to the truth of the Faith. It is reported of him, that when he was an Infant, a swarm of Bees setled on his face, as be lay in his Cradle, and flew away without hurting of him, where∣upon his Father said, If this childe live, he will be some great man. He flourished anno Christi 361. Helv. Chron. Cardinal Baronius at the commandment of Pope Sixtus, wrote St Ambrose his life with all diligence.

Upon whose Scholastical Works by Popish Divines, are published as many Commentaries, as upon the holy Scripture, and his Summes are more frequently read in their Schools and Academies, then the Bible it self; yet he when he was near his end, taking the Bible, is said to have uttered this speech, Credo quicquid in hoc libro scriptum est, I believe whatsoever is written in this book. It is said, he got his knowledge rather by prayer then labour and industry, therefore he would still pray before he did write, reade or dispute.

He was the wonder of all the world for his learning, piety and constancy, stand∣ing like an unshaken Rock against the Sea of Arian Errors. He was called Haereticorum Mallens, and was one of the chiefest in the Councel of Nice. He foretold the destruction of Iulian the Emperour, when by his Edict he was cast out of Alexandria, he said to his hearers bewailing his exile, Bono animo estote filioli nubecula est, brevi evanescet, Be of good courage my children, it is but a little Cloud, and will soon vanish away.

He was very skilfull in Greek and Latine; he wrote many things in Prose and Verse. His saying was Beatum esse non qui habet quae cupit, sed qui non cupit, quae non habet. He is blessed not which hath the things which he desires, but who doth not desire the things which he hath not. Therefore the Aquitanes did boast of him, Quemadmodum Ausonius neminem sibi proposuit imitandum: ita Ausonium nemo nunc potest imitari.

He hath made a long and learned Collection of Ecclesiasticall story, and dige∣sted
it into a good method, and will be usefull for a distinct comprehension of Ec∣clesiasticall story. But he was no Grecian, and is not much to be trusted; for 1. He makes use sometimes of spurious authours, and gives them for faithfull witnesses. 2. He indeavours by all means to advance the Popes Supremacy. He is the Papists great Champion for Ecclesiasticall history, as Bellarmine is for Controversies; they esteemed him the Father of Church-story. Alsted cals Baronius his Annals the Tower of Babel, and Bellarmines books of Controversie Goliahs sword.

Pasquier Recherches de la France, l. 7. c. 11. shews that the French Poets imita∣ting the Latine, have often equalled, and sometimes exceeded them. He instan∣ceth in the description of the old Chaos by Ovid, and compares with it that of Du Bartas, and in some verses of Virgils and Rousards: Although (saith he) some would blame du Bartas his style as too swelling, yet his work hath been very well liked, not only for the worthy subject which he praiseth, but also for his learning, fine Discourses, pithy strains, and proper deductions which accom∣pany it. Antoie du Verdier in his Bibliotheque much commends him.

Brit. Antiquitates. Learnedest man of his time, skillfull in Divine and Secular Learning. Of his rare learning and knowledge his Writings yet extant are a clear and sufficient testimony. He was so great a follower of St Augustine (the worthiest Pillar of the Church since the Apostles time, as some hoid) that his Commentaries upon the Scripture, both of Old and New Testament, are almost word for word out of St Augustine. He was a continuall Preacher, as his Homilies do testifie. He was usually called Venerable Bede, but why, the Monks usque ad ineptias cer∣tant, as Lilius Gyraldus saith, De Poet. Hist. Dial. 5. Some of the reasons given for that title are ridiculous. One saith, Pietate & eruditione venerabilis cognomen adeptus est. He was called Venerable for his Piety and Learning. Others say he was called Venerable, because that was the title of Presbyter, and his Homilies were read in his life time, and they calling him then not Saint but Venerable, so called him after his death. Vide Trithem. de Script. Eccles. Sedulius is likewise styled Venerabilis. Beda's Works were printed in three Tomes at Paris, An. 1545. and in eight Tomes at Basil, Anno Domini 1563. in Folio, containing four great Vo∣lumes.

Possevine in his Biblioth. Select. tomo 1o l. 7. c. 4. saith of his four Tomes of Con∣troversies, Opus absolutissimum, quòd Controversiarum fermè omnium corpus dici queat. Gretser in his Preface to his Defence of Bellarmines Controversies also highly magnifies him. Cardinall D' Ossat in his fifth book of French Letters saith thus of him, Est celuy qui a faict cet oeuure incomparable des Controverses pour la Religion Catholique, contre toutes les heresies qui sont auiourd' huyr & qui ont estè au temps passè; & nostre sainct Pere le faisant Cardinal a voulu honorer tant la vertu, & doctrine, & labeur de ce personnage, que le College des Cardinaux. It is he which hath made this In∣comparable work of Controversies for the Catholick Religion, against all the heresies of this day and of times past; and our holy Father in making him Cardi∣nal, would herein honour, both the Vertue, Learning, and Labour of this Per∣son, and the Colledge of Cardinals.

He was a Venetian, and a Cardinall: his Life is written by Iohannes Casa. His style is disliked by Lipsius and others. It is no marvell if Lipsius disliked his style, it being nothing like his own, but he was a great Ciceronian, as also was Sadoletus the Cardinall his great friend, and above them both, he who was familiar with them both, Longolius. Peter Bembus is reported to have said (witnesse George Fabricius and Alexander of Hales in his Commentary upon the 2d of Tim.)

Num ergo Papista fuerat, qui contra Jesuitas, contra Tridentinos, in maximis fidei articulis Ecclesiam Catholicam & Patrum consensum sequitur? Dicam apertè quod res est. Bernardus Romani Pontificis jurisdictionem longe supra omnes superiores Patres exulit. Atque hinc est, quod Papista vocetur à Bellarmino. Nam Cyprianus, Augustinus, Ambrosius, aliique superiores Ro∣mani Pontificis jurisdictionem cohiburunt. Bernardus autem incidit in fatalia illa tempora, ultra annum mille∣simum, Satana jam soluto.

The book which he wrote de Cor∣pore & Sanguine Christi to Carolus Calvus the Emperour, was forbidden to be read, by order from the Roman Inquisition, confirmed afterward by the Coun∣cell of Trent. The Divines of Doway perceiving that the forbidding of that book did not keep men from reading it, but gave them rather occasion to seek more earnestly after it, thought it better policy that Bertram should be permitted to go abroad, but handled in such sort, as other ancient Writers that made against them were wont to be.

CHAP. IX. C THomas de Vio Cajetanus, an Italian and a Cardinall.Vir meo judi∣cio quamvis Papista tamen candidus, plu∣rimumque distans ab ea pertinacia quam in reli∣quis deplorare cogimur. Cam. de Canone Tom. 1. l. 12. c. 1. A man very well read in Divinity, having studied it even from a childe, who for the happiness of  wit, and for his laborious diligence, became the prime Divine of that and many more ages, unto whom there was no Prelate or person in the Councell who would not yield in Learning, or thought himself too good to learn of him. This Cardinall, going Legate to Germany in the year 1523. studying exactly how those that erred might be reduced to the Church, and the Arch-heretiques convinced, found out the true remedy, which was, the literall meaning of the text of the Scripture in the Originall Tongue in which it was written, and all the residue of his life, which was 11 years, he gave himself to the study of the Scri∣pture, expounding not the Latine Translation, but the Hebrew Roots of the Old, and the Greek of the New Testament. In which Tongues, having no knowledge himself, he imployed men of understanding, who made construction of the Text unto him word by word, as his Works upon the holy Texts do shew. That good Cardinall was wont to say, that to understand the Latine text, was not to under∣stand the infallible Word of God, but the word of the Translator, subject and obnoxious unto errour.

Iulius Casar, a great Conquerer, and as great a Scholar.Xenophon and Caesar wrote their own acts so wisely, and without all suspicion of partiality, as none hath been so upright in writing the histories of others.

One of the soundest Divines and of deepest judgement in matters of Religion, both of Doctrine and of Discipline that God gave to his Church this 1000 years. Mr Travers.

He was a good Writer both in Latine and French, and one to whom our French Language is exceedingly obliged, for having enriched it with many good Treati∣ses; and I would they had been upon a better subject. He was marvellously ver∣sed and skilled in the books of the holy Scripture, and such a one that if he had turned his spirit the good way, he might have been set for a Paragon of the most famous Doctors of the Church. This and more he hath there of him. I willingly acknowledge him to have been an excellent instrument in the Church of God, and a man of a deep judgement, specially in the Exposition of holy Scri∣pture (which I think none condemn more then those who have read him least) yet withall I freely confess he had his errours.

he was compelled publickly to recant, as Sleyden relates, the other because he was reported in his youth in verse to have praised that which is abominable, and so for severall causes, both of them lost that dignity.

Again, At vero aetate nostra: qua pauci quoque virorum caput altius in literis ex∣tulerunt: unicam te tamen existere puellam: quae pro lana librum: pro fuso calamum: stylum pro acu tractes. Afterwards, Scribis Epistolas Cassandra subtiles: acutas: elegantes: latinas: & quanquam puellari quadam gratia: virginali quadam simplicitate dulcissimas:

Smeton. ad Hamilton. Apostat. Or∣thodox. Resp. Frier Dominicus Soto, who had a great part in the Synod of Trent, in framing the Decrees of Originall sinne, and Justification, having noted all the opinions and reasons used in those Discussions, thought to communicate them unto the world, and to draw the words of the Decree to his own meaning, printed a Book containing the whole together, and did intitle it De Natura & Gratia, and did Dedicate it with an Epistle to the Councell, to be (as he said in the Dedication) a Commentary of the two foresaid Decrees. Coming to the Article of the certain∣ty of grace, he said in a long Discourse, that the Synod had declared, that a man cannot know he hath grace by so great Certainty, as is that of Faith, excluding all doubt. Catarins newly made Bishop of Minori, having defended the con∣trary, and still persevering, did print a little book, with an Epistle Dedicatory to the same Synod; the scope whereof was, to maintain that the Councels meaning was not to condemn the opinion of him that saith A just man may know he hath grace, as certainly as he knoweth the Articles of Faith to be true: yea that the Councell hath decided that he is bound to beleeve it, because in the 26 Canon it hath condemned him that saith, That the just man ought not to hope for and expect a reward, it being necessary, that he that ought to hope as a just man, should know he is so. In this contrariety of opinions, both writing affirmatively to the Councell; either of them did not only say that his opinion was the opinion of the Synod, but afterwards wrote also and Printed Apologies and Antipologies; making complaints to the Synod the one of the other, of attributing that to it, which it never said, bringing divers testimonies of the Fathers to prove their own opinion: who bare witness some for one, some for another. This seemed to put all men out of hope to understand the meaning of the Councell, seeing the prin∣cipall men that were present in it did not agree. History of the Counc. of Trent, l. 2. p. 229, 230.

He was Publique Oratour, and Greek Reader in Cambridge. In the discharge of the later he went over Sophocles twice, all Homer, all Euripides, and part of He∣rdotus. Roger Ascham in the first Book of his Epistles, speaking of him and Sir Thomas Smith, saith, Qui si adscribendum se dedissent, nec in Sadoleto Italia, nec in Longolio Gallia, justius, quam in istis duobus Anglia gloriata fuisset. He was the first Regius Professour of the Greek Tongue in Cambridge, as Sir Thomas Smith was of Law. They were both Fellows of the same Colledge, both Professours in the same University, both Officers of State in the same Court, both wrote De pronunciatione linguae Graecae. They two especially by their advice and example brought the study of Tongues, and other politer Learning first into re∣quest in Cambridge. Under God Sir Iohn Cheek was a special instrument of the propagation of the Gospel, and that religion which we now professe in this Kingdom. For he notDr L. in the life of Sir John Cheek. only sowed the seeds of that Doctrine in the heart of Prince Edward, which after∣ward grew up iuto a general Reformation, when he came to be King, but by his means the same saving truth was gently instilled into the Lady Elizabeth, by those who by his procurement were admitted to be the Guides of her younger studies. In Henry the eighths time his friends and familiars were most of those worthy men which proved Reformers in King Edwards dayes, and either Martyrs or ex∣iles in Queen Maries. His forreign acquaintance were Sleidan, Melancthon, Sturmius, Bucer, Camerarius, Celius, Peter Martyr, and others, great Scholars, and good Protestants. He went into Low-Germany, Ut uxorem educeret, saith Sleiden, to fetch his wife from thence. These words were corrupted into Uxorem duceret by Thuanus and others, for he was married before. In his return from Bruxwels to Antwerp he was apprehended by a Provost-Mar∣tial from King Philip, and so conveighed speedily away to the Tower of London. He was there by threatnings, and other wayes brought to a recantation, for which he was after much troubled, and so died. Sir Iohn Cheeks Works were, Introductio Grammatices, l. 1.

The first Nicene Councel called by the Emperour Constantine the Great against Arius, who denied the Deity of Christ. This was held in the year of our Lord 325. at Nice in Bithinia. It consisted of 318 Bishops. The Fathers of that Coun∣cel did publish a Creed against the Arians. The greatest of all Councels next to the Apostles Councel, the great Councel of Nice of 318 Bishops.

The first Constantinopolitan Councel called by the Emperour Theodosius the elder against Macedonius, who denied the Deity of the holy Ghost, in the year of the Lord 383, or 384. The first Ephesine Councel called by Theodosius the younger against Nestorius, who held, That there were two persons in Christ, in the year 430, or 434. 4. The Chalcedonian Councel called by the Emperour Martian against Euty∣ches, which affirmed, That there was onely one Nature in Christ after the Incar∣nation, in the year of the Lord 451, or as some 452, and others 454. To these two other Councels are added, the fifth, the second Constantinopolitan, in the year 548, or as others reckon it 553. called by Iustinian against the Arians, Nestoriaens, Eutychians. The sixth is the third Constantinopolitan Councel against the Monothelites, in the year 681, called by Constantinus Pognatus or Barbarus.

was the onely Judge and disposer of all things passed therein against all good Examples, Laws, Equity and Reason. Though the Councel of Trent hath been sufficiently answered by the Protestant Divines, yet that excellent History of the Councel of Trent was never answered by the Papists. In the Councel of Constance Communion under both kindes, and Wickliffs opi∣nions were condemned. Iohn Hus and Ierom of Prague were burned against faith given, and safe conduct granted by the Emperour. Then that wicked maxim was established, Haeretici fides non est seruanda, which is against Nature, Scripture, and the Law of Nations. There is Summa Conciliorum & Pontificum à Petro usque ad Concilium Tridenti1600. Lugduni. num per Bartholomaeum Caranzam Ord. praedicat. The National Synod of Dort began in the year 1618. To which were sent from England, France, Germany, and other Reformed Churches, many Learned and Orthodox Divines, to discusse and unfold those unhappy Arminian Controversies with which the Low-countreys was then molested.Hic um cele∣berr ima illa Doctrinae confessio, ab urbe in qua & scripta, & Ca∣rolo V.

The Confessions of Faith of the Churches professing the Gospel, having been long ago exhibited to the several Princes of the Countreys, States and Kingdoms where these Churches are, are now of ate very profitably published to the just conviction of all such as slander the Reformed Churches to be variably distracted and rent in sunder with infinite differences of Faith. Beza hath put out the Harmony of Confessions with Notes upon it. The most famous is the Augustane Confession. The Elector of Saxony with the other Princes and Protestant Cities joyned with him, presented to the Emperour Charles the fifth, the Confession of their Faith, written in Latine and Dutch, which afterward from this place, where it was read was called Augustana. It contained two parts: in the first was expounded one and twenty Articles of their Creed. In the second were expounded the Doctrines which were different from the Church of Rome, and the abuses which the Confes∣sionists reproved. The Cities which followed the Doctrine of Zuinglius, present∣ed apart the Confession of their Faith, not differing from the former, but onely in the point of the Eucharist. History of the Councel of Trent, translated by Sir Nathan. Brent, l. 1. p. 54. See Sleid. Comment. lib. 7. and Melch. Ad. in vita Brentii. Conformities.This holy Book of Conformities, and St Fran∣cis life is in English, so B. Down. of Antichrist, and Crashaw in his Iesuites Gospel, though I cannot purchase it. Crashaw also speaks largely of it in his Sermon preached at Pauls Crosse 9th wound. There was printed at Bononia in Italy, Anno 1590. a book intituled, Liber Conformitatum Beati ac Seraphici Patris Francisci, written by one Bartholomeus Pisanus a Franciscan Frier, and published by one Hieronymus Buchius, of which book it is affirmed in the Title page, that it is Liber Aureus, a golden book. There he paints a tree; at the top whereof is Christ, and at the root St Francis: the tree hath twenty branches on the right, and twenty on the left side, and every branch hath four particular fruits; in all eighty: These are equally divided between Christ and St Francis, fourty to the one, and fourty to the other, and each cou∣ple or pair of these is one point of Conformity between Christ and St Francis, consisting in all upon fourty particulars, wherein they begin at the birth, and the conception, nay at the very Prophecies and Promises made of Christ, and so pro∣ceed to his life, his death, his resurrection and ascension: and in all, and every of these, and every thing else whatsoever may be said of Christ, the very same do they not shame to affirm of that man Francis.
This was not the superfluity of idle and superstitious Monks brains, but the pub∣lick Act of their Church, and many Popes one after another allowed it, and by their Charters have confirmed the truth of this Story.

Thomas Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury, Martyr.He died a Mar∣tyr anno 1556 Cranmer a furtherer of learning and godlinesse. He was the first Archbishop of Canterbury that cast off Antichrist. As Britain was most blessed under Edward the sixths Reign, so much by his means. That he might settle the Doctrine of the Gospel in both the Univer∣sities, he sent for the most famous Divines out of forraign Naions, and drew them into England, Peter Martyr, Bucer, Fagius, Lascus, Immanuel Tremellius, Ber∣nardus Ochinus, All which with their wives and children were liberally maintained by him. This way he spent his yearly revenew, so that nothing remained to himself.
He studied the Scriptures diligently and wrote against that grosse opinion of theHis English Books are men∣tioned by An∣drew Maunsel in his Catalogue of English books Papists, affirming the carnal presence of Christ in the Sacrament, a Book filled with so much learning and plenty of arguments, that that controversie seems to be handled by none more accurately against the Papists. Steven Gardiner Bishop of Winchester being prisoner in the Tower by stealth, and largely inveighed against this Book, in that Book which he named Marcus Constantius. This Peter Martyr learnedly refuted Cranmer being dead. After the death of King Edward, when Cranmer was advised by his friends toHoc in Cran∣mero admira∣bile visum est, quod etsi mi∣tissimus ac fa∣cillimus in omnibus rebus judicareur, tamen si divinam veritatem labefactari aut oppugnari à quocunque sentiret, nemo unquam in bellis Imperator majorem animi magnitudinem constantiamque declararet. Antiq. Eccles. Britan. p. 341. flie, If I were (saith he) accused of theft, treason, parricide, or any other wic∣kednesse, I could be induced to flie much more easily then in this cause. For when the Question is not concerning my faith toward men, but toward God, and con∣cerning my constancy in the truth of the holy Scripture against Popish errours, I would rather in this case lose my life then leave the Kingdom. When King Henry purposed to imprison his Daughter Mary being stiffe for the Popish faction, only Cranmer interceded and mitigated the Kings anger, but the ill will that Queen Mary bore him for having a hand in her Mothers Divorce, that inveterate hatred (I say) toward him, blotted out all his friendly Offices to her.

Pasquier Recherch. de la France, l. 9. c. 35. saith there were these remarkable ex∣cellencies in him; he was a great Poet, a great Divine, a great Lawyer. He put out a Book entitled Speculum Iuris, divided into three great Tomes. As Lombard among Divines is not quoted by his own name, but by that of Master of the Sentences, so among the Lawyers he is not quoted by the name of William Durand, but he is styled Speculator. He delivered this sentence about the Sacrament: Verbum audimus, modum senti∣mus, modum nescimus, praesentiam credimus.

Favour and love of Religion was in him from his childhood. Such an instrument given of God to the Church of England he was, as England never had better.
Cardan saith this of him: Being but fifteen years of age, he asked of me in Latine, (in which tongue he uttered his minde no lesse readily and eloquently then I could do my self) what my Books which I had Dedicated unto him De varietate Rerum did contain? Cardan made answer, and the King wittily replied severall times, as Mr Fox in his 2d Book of Acts and Monum. p. 65. relates. He restored holy Scriptures to the mother Tongue, he abolished Masses; such as were in banishment for the danger of the truth, were again received to their Country. During the time of the six years of this King there was much tranquility to the whole Church of England.

That he did not set down the divers readings very exactly. 2. That he did not relate the number of the Manuscripts, which he used, and where they were to be seen. From the Collation of Greek and ancient Copies, he corrected also all the New Testament. Ingeniosus veterum Scriptorum Censor; So Ludovicus Vives.

He was excellently skilled in the Oriental Tongues, the Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabick, Syriack, Aethiopick, Persian and Turkish.

He is celebrated through the whole Christian world, as the restorer of the Arabick Tongue. He was of incredible diligence and indu∣stry, to which was added a rare facility of wit and sweetnesse of manners, for which he was much respected by Philip Mornie, Ioseph Scaliger, Isaac Ca∣saubone.

A Divine of Paris right famous, he was present at the Councell of Constance, and in books written he commendeth highly the Decree whereby it is agreed that the Bishop of Rome should be subject to the Counsell. And saith the thing is worthy to be written in all Churches and publick places, for a perpetuall me∣mory. For he saith they are pestilent flatterers which bring this Tyranny into the Church, as though the Bishop of Rome ought neither to obey the Counsell, nor be judged by the same, as though the Counsell should take all its force and authority from him, as though it could not be called but at his pleasure, as though he were bound to the observation of no Laws, nor no accompt might be taken of his doings. These monstrous sayings must be utterly rejected, which are against all Laws equity and reason. For all the authority of the Church dependeth on the generall Counsell, and it is lawfull to appeal from the Pope unto it: and those which inquire whether the Bishop of Rome or the Church be greater, make as wise a question as if they should ask whether the part be more, or the whole, for it appertaineth to the Counsell, to constitute, to judge, and to depose the Bishop of Rome, as lately it was declared at Constance.

He was an humble, devout, and holy Bishop, and had many pious Mar∣tyrs his Predecessors as Popes or Fathers in that See of Rome: he deserved the title of Gregory the Great for abhorring the name of Universall Bishop.
Bede cals him Apostolum nostrum our Apostle, and he gives this reason for it, quod nostram, id est, Anglorum gentem de potestate Satanae ad fidem Christi sua in∣dustria convertit, because he converted our Nation by his own industry from the power of Satan to the faith of Christ. He sent Austen the Monk and other Legates hither. See Pet. du Moulins Antibarbarian, ch. 13. He first wrote Servus Servorum Dei, putting the Roman Bishops in remem∣brance thereby, both of their humblenesse, and also of their duty in the Church of Christ.

When he was Bishop of Neocesarea in Pontus, he blessed God that when he came first to his charge, he found not above seventeen Christians, and when he departed from them, he left not in all his Diocesse so many unbaptized, or un∣believers.

Amongst the most famous Contradictors, which the Doctrine of Luther found, was Henry the 8th King of England, who not being born the Kings eldest son, had been destinate by his Father to be Archbishop of Canterbury, and therefore in his youth was made to study: But the eldest being dead, and after him the father also, he succeeded in the Kingdom. Esteeming it a great honour to imploy himself in so famous a Controversie of Learning, he wrote a Book of the seven Sacraments, defending also the Popedom, and oppugning the Doctrine of Luther: a thing so gratefull to the Pope, that having received the Kings book, he honoured him with the title of Defender of the Faith. But Martin suffered not himself to be scared with that most illustrious glittering name of a King, but answered his Majesty with as much acrimony, vehemency, and as small respect, as he had answered the petty Doctors.

It was translated into the Germane, French, Italian, Spanish Tongue, and into the English by the Lady Anne Bacon, wife to the Lord Chancellour Bacon.

The second a succinct and solid Refutation of Objections. He had at hand a great paper-book, as it were a rich treasury of Sciences, in which he wrote his divine and humane collections out of Poets, Philosophers and Divines. We call it a Common-place book. Doctor Rainolds in his Letter to his friend concerning his advice for the study of Divinity, saith thus,
Touching noting, you know, I do not like the common custom of Common∣place Books. The best in my judgement is to note in the Margent, or in some pa∣per-book for that purpose the Summe and Method of that which you reade. In other little Books which he carried about with him (an Ephemerides or Diary) he diligently wrote all the Apophthegmes and witty speeches, or jests which he heard from others, or observed any way, by which means he much increased his knowledge yearly. He was very affable and courteous, amiable in his whole life, in speech witty and pleasant; in his writings he is solid and yet facetious. He fled in Q. Maries dayes, and returned when Q.

He was given to Eusebius Bishop of Nicomedia to be instructed, of whom also he learned the Doctrine of the Church, and was made a Reader in the Church of Nicomedia. But he was a hearer secretly of Libanius the Rhetorician, and was fa∣miliarly acquainted with the most famous Philosophers of that time. He was drawn back by these by degrees to the Heathenish Religion. He wrote Books against the Christians, and reproved their Doctrine, especially the prohibitions of revenge delivered, which, though they properly belong to private revenge, yet he wrested them for publick revenge, and he said by these, Magistrates, punishments, lawfull warres were taken away, and all the sinews of retaining humane Societies. Ammianus Marcellinus commends his Temperance in meat and drink, and his continual watching, and the partition of the night into private, publick and di∣vine offices. He took away the great Gifts and holy Vessels which Constantine the Great had given to the Churches use, and Ministers maintenance, with this scoff, See in what goodly vessels this Nzarite is served. It was one of his scoffs when he robbed the Churches and the Christians, He did it that the Galileans (so he contumeliously called the Christians) might go more rea∣dily to heaven. He not onely killed the Christians, but scoffed at Christ himself and the Scri∣ptures. He had scarce raigned two years, when warring against the Persians, he was struck and mortally wounded with a Spear in that warre, as Nazianzene, Theodo∣ret, Socrates, Sozomen, and others uno ere docent, and filling his hand with bloud, casting it into the air, he cried out, Vicisti Galilae, Ita simul & victoriam confessus est, & blasphemiam evomit, saith Theodoret.

A famous Philosoph and a great Defender of Christian Religion, who first exhibited unto the Emperour Antoninus Pius, and to the Senate, an Apology in the Defence of the Christians, and afterward himself also died a Martyr. He flourished in the Church after Christ about the year 150, so Zanchy Others say 163. He is the ancientest of the Fathers (whose writings remain) except Clement. He lived in the very next Age to the Apostles, and Tertullian lived the next Age to him. He was first allured to the Faith by the cruelty of Tyrants, and by the constancy and patience of Gods Saints. In the year of Christ 163. he suffered Martyrdom for the faith under Marcus Aurelius Antoninus the Philosopher, and Lucius Verus Emperours.Apologiam scripsit, eam∣que Imperato∣ri Pio obtulit, anno Christi centesimo quinquagesimo.

And he would have been a Pope absolutely compleat, if with these he had joyned some knowledge in things that concern Religion, and some more propension unto piety, of both which he seemed carelesse.

Also when he went up the stair of the Scaffold, he desired one of the Sheriffs Officers to give him his hand to help him up, he said, When I come down again, let me shift for my self so well as I can. Also the hang-man kneeled down to him, asking him forgivenesse of his death, as the manner is.

Also, even when he should lay down his neck on the block, he having a great gray beard, stroaked out his beard, and said to the hang-man, I pray you let me lay my beard over the block, leat you should cut it; others relate it thus, that he said, it never committed treason; thus with a mok he ended his life.

He was in his Age a mirrour of gravity, integrity, constancy, zeal, piety, learning of all sorts, both divine and humane, of so happy a memory that he had the Bible without book, of such admirable eloquence, that not words but honey seemed to drop from his lips; of so indefatigable industry, that he was called A∣damantius, and was said by some to have written six thousand books.

An eloquent man, and too precise a follower of Tully. In his Book against Luther and Doctor Haddon he dares not name the words of Justification or Pre∣destination. And I wonder (saith Mr. Fox) that he dares insert the name of Christ in his Books, since it is not found in Tully. Nec Iustificationis aut praedestinationis vocabula ipsa vel nominare audes.

For opinion and same of Learning, he was accepted, not onely here in England with Linacro, Gro∣cinus, More, and others, but also known and reported abroad in such sort, that in all the great heap of Erasmus his Epistles, he wrote almost to none so many, as to him.

Against him wrote Austen, Hierom, Cyrillus, Orosius, Innocentius, Gennadius, and at the last Thomas Bradwardine a Doctor here in England. The Pelagians were so called from him, and also Caelestiani from Caelestius one of Pelagius his Scholers. These taught that death was not the wages of sin, but that Adam should have died, though he had not sinned. That Adams sinne was hurtfull only to himself, and not to his posterity: That concupiscence was no sinne: That Infants did not draw Originall sinne from their Parents:Vide August. de Haeres. p. 256, 257, 258.

He was born in the year 1304▪ and died in the year 1374. having lived 70 years wanting but a day. There is in his Latine Works a neat expression, a spirit sinewy and sententious, a style short and concise. He was another Seneca. He calleth Rome the Whore of Babylon, the School and mother of errour, the Temple of heresie, the nest of treachery, and seemeth plainly to affirm, that the Pope was Antichrist, declaring that no greater evil could happen to any man, then to be made Pope. His life is written by Papirius Massonus. There was great flocking after him, from France and all Italy. Sacras literas, ut humiles & incomptas, & humanioribus impares nimio illarum amore, & contemptu harum, & opinione de se falsa, atque impotenti inventa, diù tumidus adolescens, fugit. Verùm liber confessionum divi Augustini, aditus ei postre∣mò fuit, ad omnes sacras literas, sibique librum illum praedicat autorem fuisse, ut ado∣lescentiae vitia dimitteret. Papir. Masson. ib. He wrote De vita solitaria. De remediis utriusque fortunae. De Communi mundi contemptu. De vita sapientis. Bucolica, Eclogae: & alia venustissima Poemata quae scripsit lingua Hetrusca: and other Works mentioned by Boissard in his Icones. His Ancestors were Florentines, and lived in exile, but he returned home and died in his own Country of an Apoplexy. He was buried at Arquato Montanere, a village belonging unto Padita, where in honour of him a Sepulchre of Marble was built, and an Epitaph of his own making inscribed, part whereof is as fol∣loweth, Frigida Francisci lapis hic regit ossa Fessus{que} in terris, caeli requiescit in arce. Petronius Arbiter, an obscene Writer, yet his Latine is pure and elegant.Multae erudi∣tionis homi∣nem Petronium fuisse facilè cognoscimus, nam in taxandis moribus cum acrem▪ tum festivum maximè, & jocis seria, miscentem videmus.

Thuan. Commont. de vita sua l. 4. We may judge of his great abilities, by those little Tracts de Coena Dominica, de Missae sacrificio, de Igne purgatorio, de Imaginum usu, and some other things that way, and likewise of his little difference from us in the weightiest points of our Religion, the more pity is it, that his excellent Notes on a great part of the New Testament should so unhappily perish after his death, as Thuanus re∣lates.

Id ibid. He was skilled in Hebrew, Greek, Latine, Spanish, French. He adorned the most inward rooms of his house with greater Geographicall Tables or Mapes, and with the Icones of illustrious men. He had Books sent him out of all Europe. He is much commended by Gassendus in vita Peireskii p. 30, 31. Iohn Piscator.

Casaubone never saw him (as Thuanus in the 6th book of his Commenta∣ries concerning his own life saith) yet how doth he extoll him? He had rare and exact knowledge in all Antiquity, Ecclesiasticall history and other wayes. His disposition was sweet, and he farre from all ambition and deceit, he was very prudent and skilfull in mannaging affairs.
Thuanus in the first part of the fifth Tome of his Hist. l. 117. much commends him, and at last concludes thus of him, that in the Civill Law of the Romans, he came to that height, that it might be justly said of him, and his most famous Ma∣ster Cuiacius, Hunc discipulo praeripuisse, ne primus Iurisconsultas esset, illum prae∣ceptori, ne solus. All the great men of this age (saith Papirius Massonus in his Elogia) make honourable mention of him in their books, and some of these dedicate their Wri∣tings to him and his brother Francis, as the lights of France. Many of his Books are mentioned in Oxford Catalogue.

He wrote 37 Books of the History of the world, and was Uncle to him who wrote the Epistles, as the Epistle 16. l. 6. ad Cornelium Tacitum shews. The whole Epistle is about the death of the elder Pliny, and begins thus, Petis ut tibi avunculi mei exitum scribam, &c. He sometimes labours more to write much, then exactly.

He lived under Domitian and Nerva, but flourished especially under Trajane. He was his Schoolmaster, and dedicated the Collection of his Apothegmes to him. It was said of him, if all Authours were lost he alone might supply. Ita judico caeterorum scriptorum jacturam vel unius Plutarchi operibus resarciri posse. Frischlinus in defensione Aristophanis. His Lives and Morals were his best Works. His Lives make an abridgement of all the best things contained in the Greek and Latine Histories. He was a follower of Plato, but an enemy to the Epicures and Stoicks. Plutarchus totius antiquitatis rimator, & indagator tam curiosus, libro aureo de sera numinis vindicta. Herald. Animadvers.

Theodorus Gaza a Grecian born, of singular learning, being once asked by his familiar friends, which saw him so greatly affectioned to his study, what Authour he would choose amongst many, if he could keep but one alone, he answered Plutarke, because there is none so profitable and delightfull also to reade as he.

In Calvins Epistles and Answers Bullinger writes to Calvin, that England had returned to the Pope and Popery, and that the devil to recover it had used two speciall instruments, the Bishop of Winchester within the Kingdom, and Cardinall Poole without it, who then was made Archbishop of Canterbury. And he shews there that Cardinall Poole was received with great solemnity at Pauls Crosse in London; and that the Bishop of Winchester in that Assembly revoked the Oration which he had before published under Henry the 8th, de Obedientia, and that Car∣dinall Poole when he spake to Queen Mary, blasphemously used the words of the Angell, Ave Maria gratia plena, Dominus tecum.

Being a Monk in Italy, and singularly well learned, he preached sore against the evil life of the spiritualty, and specially of his own Order, complaining sore upon them, as the Authours of all misehiefs and wickednesse. Whereupon by the help of certain learned men, he began to seek Reformation in his own Order. He threatned Italy with the wrath and indignation of God, and prophesied before unto them, that the Land should be overthrown for the pride and wickednesse of the people, and for the untruth, hypocrisie and falshood of the Clergy, which God would not leave unrevenged, as afterward it came to passe, when Charles the French King came into Italy and to Rome, and so straitly beset the Pope Alex∣ander,Ante annos 90. exustus est Florentiae celeberrimus▪ Concionator Hieronymus Savanarola Monachus Dominicanus cum aliquot sociis.

Mounsieur Du Plessis likewise condoles with him in so great a losse, and saith, That Scaliger indeed made one of the integral parts of the better Learning of this Age, but (saith he) he was aged, and therefore to have lived longer would have been but a burden; and he doubts not likewise but the Jesuites would insult over this dead Lion, but it makes for Scaligers honour (quoth he) to have such Adver∣saries, Ut omnis boni osores, ita & omnibus exosos. And I assure my self, that when they shall attempt it, they shall not do it impune, as long as you shall live, which ought therefore to redouble your courage, that so Christianity may finde a supply of the other want in your increased abilities, as Physicians say, when one eye is lost, the other sees the better.

And addes, That in all that while in which he was acquainted with him, he never heard him dispute of the controverted points of Religion, or that he knew was he accu∣stomed to write to others about them, Neque vero (saith he) nisi provocatus de iis nec nisi invitissimus disserebat; and concludes thus, Quasi vero extra Religionis caussam non multa praeclara & supra captum, quantum ad literas, humanum in ea admiranda essent, quae bonus quisque ab eo cognoscere & doceri merito cuperet, & pro∣pter tam raras in eum à Deo cumulatas dotes non ipse observari ac praecipua veneratione à bonis quibusque mereretur.

B. Ush. Answ. to the Jes. Challenge. He is described to be of a sharp wit, of great eloquence, and well expert in the Greek Tongue, pleasant and merry of nature and conditions, as appeareth by di∣vers his doings and answers. First, He coming to France out of his own Countrey of Scotland (so saith Mr Fox) by reason of great tumults of warre, was there worthily entertained, and for his Learning had in great estimation of Carolus Calvus the French King; whom he commonly and familiarly used to have about him, both at Table, and in Chamber. Upon a time the King sitting at meat, and seeing something (belike in this IohnMr Foxes Acts and Monum. Vol. 1. p. 186, 187. Mat∣thaeus West∣monasteriensis. p. 171. hath the same. Scot) which seemed not very courtly, cast forth a merry word, asking of him, What difference there was betwixt a Scot and a Sot? Whereunto the Scot sitting over against the King, somewhat lower, replied again suddenly, rather then advi∣sedly, yet merrily, saying, Mensa tantúm, that is, the Table onely: importing thereby himself to be the Scot, and so calling the King a Sot by craft. Another time the same King being at Dinner was served with a certain dish of fish, wherein were two great fishes, and a little one. After the King had taken thereof his repast, setteth down to Iohannes Scotus the foresaid fish to distribute unto the other two Clerks, sitting there with him: which were two tall and migh∣ty persons, he himself being but a little man. Iohannes taketh the fish, of the which, the two great he taketh and carveth to himself; the little fish he reacheth to the other two. The King perceiving his division thus made, reprehended the same. Then Iohannes, whose manner ever was to finde out some honest matter to delight the King, answered to him again, proving his division to stand just and equal: For here (saith he) be two great, and a little, pointing to the two great fishes and
himself: and likewise here again is a little one, and two great, pointing to the lit∣tle fish, and two great persons: I pray you (saith he) what distribution can be more equal? Whereat the King with his Nobles being much delighted, laughed merrily.

Some like his Marmora Arundeliana, some his Books concerning the Jewish Rites and Customes, others much commend his Titles of Honour; but I must con∣fesse my self to be most taken with that De Diis Syris, wherein he opens many places of Scripture. Others, I believe also are of the same judgement. He is honourably mentioned by many outlandish men. He wrote in all his Books , above all Liberty, to shew, that he would examine things, and not take them upon trust. Nicolaus Selneccerus Doctor of Divinity and Professor of the same in the Uni∣versity of Lipsia. He wrote this Distick for himself, Quid sum? Nil. Quis sum? Nullus, sed gratia Christi, Quod sim, quod vivo, quodque labore, facit.

As if you should say Doctrinale, in which the Jews have made as it were their Canon Law, and their Divinity out of the sentences and examples of their ancient Doctors, after the same manner that Peter Lombard the book of Sentences, and Gra∣tian the Decrees among the Papists. That work was first begun as the Jews them∣selves, Masius, Genebrard and Petrus Galatinus have recorded, within two hun∣dred years from the Nativity of Christ, although it was long after finished, at least the Babylonian Talmud, for the Talmud of Ierusalem was sooner published. See Buxtorfs Bibliotheca concerning the Editions of these two Talmuds. There are two parts of the Talmud, the Mischna containing the Text of the Talmudical Law. This came out about the year of Christ 150. This was read, explained and disputed in the Academies of Ierusalem and Babylon. Those dispu∣tations and the decisions of them were called Gemara. So of the Mischna and Gemara came the Ierusalem Talmud Anno Christi 230. But the Babylonish Talmud more perfect and copious, finished about the year of Christ 500.

He was brought up from a childe in the University of Oxford, where he by long continuance grew up, and increased as well in the knowledge of Tongues, and other liberal Arts, as specially in the knowledge of the Scriptures, whereunto his minde was singularly addicted: Insomuch that he lying then in Magdalen-Hall, read privily to certain Students and Fellows of Magdalen-Colledge some parcell of Di∣vinity; instructing them in the knowledge and truth of the Scriptures. Whose manners also and conversation, being correspondent to the same, were such, that all they that knew him, reputed and esteemed him to be a man of most virtuous di∣sposition, and of life unspotted. Fox. Act. and Monum. vol. 2. p. 361, &c. He translated the New Testament into English, and five Books of Moses. He wrote also divers other Books, which are all published in one general Volume, as also the Works of Iohn Frith and Barns.

Thuan. Histor. Tom. 1. lib. 5. Vide etiam ejus Tom. 2. lib. 28. The Bishops of Rome, Clement and Paul used his service in Germany. He was in high favour with King Ferdinando, so much that when his daughter Katharine was born, Vergerius and George Marquesse of Bran∣derburg, and Iohn Archbishop of Lunden were her Godfathers at the Font. But after he revolted from the Bishop of Rome by a wonderfull occasion, when he was sent for to Rome from the Conference of Wormes, which was in the beginning of the year 1541. The Pope going about to make new Cardinals, appointed him also among others. But there were some which privily whispered in his ear, that he was now through much familiarity with the Germans become a Lutherane. After that Ver∣gerius had heard this by Cardinal Ginueius, unto whom the Pope had told it, he was marvellously astonished. And to the intent he might purge himself, he goeth home into his Countrey, and beginneth a book, which he entitled, against the A∣postates of Germany. And whilst to confute their Arguments, he turneth over diligently the books ofSeid. Comment. l. 21. fol▪ 329. See more there. his Adversaries, and pondering deeply their reasons: He feeleth himself taken and vanquished. Then casting away all hope of his Cardinalship, he goeth to his brother Iohn Baptist Bishop of the City of Pole, and reciting the whole matter, asketh his counsel. His brother being afraid at the beginning, lamenteth his case much. But after he was perswaded by him to apply himself to the searching of the Scripture, and had considered diligently that Article of Justification, comparing the sentences together, he giveth place, and judgeth the Bishop of Romes Doctrine to be false. Whereupon they rejoyced together. And as the duty of Bishops is, began to instruct the people in Istria, and preach diligently the benefit of Christ im∣ploy'd upon mankinde, and declare what works God requireth of us, to the intent they might call men again to the true Religion.

Some compare him with Homer, nay prefer him before him; others style him Homer in Latine. This was said upon the coming forth of Virgils Aeneads. Cedite Romani scriptores, cedite Graii, Nescio quid majus nascitur Iliade. He set this Distick upon the Palace-gate of the Emperour Augustus, Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula mane, Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar habet. As much to say, God sheweth his power by the night rains, Caesar his magnifi∣cence by the pomps of the day. These two Verses were very well liked, and brought to the Emperours Majesty, who took great pleasure in them, and willed the Authour should be known. A sausie Courtier pretended to be the man, and had a good reward given him, for the Emperour himself was not only learned, but very munificent toward all learned men. Virgil seeing himself by his overmuch modesty defrauded of the reward, which an impudent person had gotten by abuse of his merit, came the next night, and fastened upon the same place this half Metre, four times iterated, thus Sic vos non vobis. Sic vos non vobis. Sic vos non vobis. Sic vos non vobis. And there it remained a great while, because no man wist what it meant, till Virgil opened the whole fraud by this devise. He wrote about the same half Metres this whole Verse hexameter, Hos ego versiculos feci tulit alter honores. And then finished the four half Metres, thus Sic vos non vobis Fertis aratra boves. Sic vos non vobis Vellera fertis oves. Sic vos non vobis Mellificatis apes. Sic vos non vobis Nidificatis ave. And put to his name Publius Virgilius Mar. This matter came by and by to the Emperours ear, who taking great pleasure in the devise, called for Virgil, and gave him not only a present reward, but also held him ever after upon larger triall he had made of his Learning and Vertue in so great reputation, as he vouchsafed to give him the name of Amicus, which among the Romans was a great honour and special favour. He made a Talisman, or brazen Fly, which he set upon one of the gates of the City Naples. which for the space of eight years kept all manner of Flies from com∣ing into the City. Gaffarels Unheard of Curiosities, Part. 2. Chap. 7. See more there. The purity of his style and conceptions is generally known, and the purity of his manners, was once admired by those of Naples, which for this reason common∣ly called him Parthenius.

Lat. l. 3. p. 550. A Monk by profession, who lived some two hundred years ago, having attained to more then ordinary knowledge both of the Tongues and Histories, applied him∣self by his knowledge and proficiency, not to help, but to cheat the world. To that end he counterfeited divers ancient Historians of best note and greatest anti∣quity, as Berosus, Manetho, Catonis Origines, and the like, which had not been heard of in many ages; and wrote Comments upon them, these passed so current for a long time, that even to this day (though descryed by divers learned men of all Nations and professions) many can scarce perswade themselves, that so many fine titles and shows should be but a piece of juggling. Scaliger in his Elench Orat. Chronol. Parei cals him Fanaticum Dominicanum. And elsewhere in that Book he saith, Ut doctior videatur, mendacia sua auctoritate priscorum auctorum firmare conatur.

Our Historians confound the Albigenses and Waldenses, though some learned men hold they are to be distinguished. The Waldeses are famous for their Antiquity, Universality and Innocency. The first original of the Waldenses came of Waldus, a man of great substance in the City of Lions. About the year of our Lord 1160. divers of the best of the
City of Lint talking and walking in a certain place after their old accustomed manner, especially in the Summer time, conferred together upon matters. A∣mongst whom it chanced one (the rest looking upon) to fall down by sudden death. This Waldus being one of them, who beholding the matter more earnestly then the other, and terrified with so heavy an example, Gods holy Spirit working with all, was stricken with a deep and inward repentance, whereupon followed a new alteration with a carefull study to reform his former life. He admonishedFoxes Acts and Monum. vol. 1 p. 199. See more there. others also to repent, and ministred large alms of his goods to such as needed. Ma∣ny people therefore daily resorting to him, and he seeing them ready and diligent to learn, he began to give out to them certain rudiments of the Scripture, which he had translated himself into the French Tongue. The Bishops seeing him so to intermeddle with Scriptures, and to have such re∣sort about him, albeit it was but in his own house under private conference, threat∣ned to excommunicate him, if he did not leave so to do. He despising their Ex∣communication, they ceased not with prison, with sword and banishment to per∣secute him, till at length they had driven both Waldus and all the favourers of his true preaching out of the City.

He preceded Luther, he was excellently learned in Physick, Divinity, in the Greek, Hebrew and Latine, and therefore of the people he was called Lux mundi, the light of the world, whom Luther was wont to call his prodromus. He demon∣strated
that the Pope was Antichrist, whom the Disciples of Christ ought in no wayes to follow. He wrote a Book De dignitate & potestate Ecclesiastica, in which book, he saith, That Subjects should be absolutely and simply bound to beleeve the Pope, is so ir∣rational and full of blasphemy, that it is found more pestilent then any heresie whatsoever. Being aged, upon a certain time when a young man called M. Ioannes Ostendorpius, came to him, he said these words; Well my childe, thou shalt live to that day, when thou shalt see that the doctrine of these new and contentious Divines, as Thomas and Bonaventure, with others of the same sort, shall be utterly rejected and exploded from all true Christian Divines. And this which Ostendorpius then being young heard Weselus to speak, he repor∣ted himself to Noviomagus, which wrote this story, Anno 1520. and heard it of the mouth of the said Weselus, Anno 1490.

And for proof of his opinion, the Abbot would alledge that saying of our Saviour Matth. 15. 13. Every plant which my hea∣venly Father hath not planted shall be rooted out. He never preached, but he first wrote his Notes in Latine, and afterward kept them during his Life. There were several writings between him and Thomas Cartwright about the Ceremonies.

Iohn Hus was his Scholar he brought his Books and Doctrine into Bohemia. He being the publick Reader in the University of Oxford, was for the rude time wherein he lived, famously reputed for a great Clerk, and expert in all kinde of Philosophy. He flourished about the year of our Lord 1371. Edward the third reigning in England. He was called Doctor Evangelicus. He was born in the North, and to this day some of his name and family do there yet remain, to whom I am allied. He was brought up in Merton Colledge in Oxford, and removed thence to Queens Colledge. He was beloved of all good men for his good life, and greatly admired of all his adversaries for his Learning and knowledge both in Divinity and humanity. He was Doctor in Divinity almost thirty years, and for some time Parson of Lutter∣worth in Leicestershire. See Camden there. Divers Works of his in written-hand remain in our Oxford-Library. He translated the whole Bible into English, with Prefaces and Arguments to every book. In his Trialogus. or Body of Divinity, l. 4. c. 7. he saith, Ideo si centum essent Papae & omnes fratres essent versi in Cardinales, non deberet concedi sententiae suae in materia fidei, nisi de quanto se fundaverit in Scriptura. He also saith, Papa est abominatio desolationis in abstracto. And Ch. 36. Olim Episcopi nostri di∣cuntur pseudofratres tanquam Diabolos odivisse, cum in tempore Domini Armachani, dicuntur ipsum in sumplibus contra hos pseudo ordines defendisse. Sed modo facti sunt amici Herodes & Pilatus, qui prius inter se fuerant inimici. There is also his Dialogus, and De Veritate Scripturae, and divers other Manu∣scripts of his well worthy the publishing. Yet he had his errours, lib. 2. of that Book, cap. 10. he saith, Angelos adoramus. See those Scriptures against that opinion, Deut. 4. 19. & 17. 3. Col. 2. 18. Apoc. 9. 10. & 20. 8, 9. He grants Purgatory also l. 4. c. 22. of that book. Yet he was the first (saith Bale) who in that dark age brought truth to light, and was bold openly to confesse Christ before the whole Synagogue of Satan, and to reveal the filthinesse of the great Whore.

He wrote to the Pope, and earnestly beg'd of him, that the Papists here might take that just Oath of Allegiance o the King, and refuted Bellarmine, who oppo∣sed it with strong reasons. This Oath (viz. of Allegiance) according to every part and parcel of the same may be lawfully taken by any Catholick, as have averred both M. Widdrington, Sir William Howard, and others. Widdrington in his New-years-gift, hath suffici∣ently proved, that besides the authority of many famous Divines, it was the opi∣nion of the chiefest secular Priests in England.

Melch. Ad. in ejus vita. His great Work, entitled Vita humanae theatrum, got him a great name. Basilius Amberbachius hearing of his death, broke out with sighs into these words▪ Piget me vivere post tantum virum: cujus magnafuit doctrina; sd exigna, si cum pietate conferatur. It irks me to live after so great a man, whose Learning was great, but small if it be compared with his piety. Many of his Works are mentioned in Oxford Catalogue.

As Germany admired her Luther, so Helvetia her Zuinglius. He was skilfull in the Greek and Hebrew Tongues, though hard to be go at that time, using the best Professours: he had a great memory, being able to repeat Valerius Maximus and St Paul by heart, whose Epistles he had copied out. He frequently disputed with both. Papists and Catabaptists, whereof Fran∣ciscus Lambertus then a minorite Fryer being one, was (as he thankfully ac∣knowledged) hereby reclaimed, and became afterwards a great Light in the Church.

Post pran∣dium audiebat vel narrantes, vel consilia rogitantes, aut confabulabatur, aut deam bulabat cum amicis, usque ad horam secundam, hinc etiam reditus ad labores. Post Coenam ubi paulisper deambulasset, fere literis scribendis vocabat, interdum ad mediam usque noctem nihil agens aliud. The Tigurins being compelled to warre against their enemies, Zuinglius was slain in the battel. It is the manner of Zurick, that when they go forth in warfare, the chief Mi∣nister of their Church goeth with them. Zuinglius also of himself being a man of a stout and bold courage, considering that if he should tarry at home, and they should go by the worse, what displeasure he should sustain, as one that in his Ser∣mons would encourage, and himself faint, when any danger was; would needs take such part as others. Sir Thomas More in his Preface to the Confutation of Tyndals Answer, hath this bitter passage, Zuinglius that first brought into Switzerland that abominable Heresie against the blessed Sacrament of the Altar, was by the hand of God this year slain in plain battel against the Catholiques, with many a thousand of his wretched Sect, being in number to the Catholiques three against one, and as proud∣ly, and with his malicious purpose invading them, as ever did the Egyptians pursue the children of Israel. His Works are published in four Tomes, mentioned by Boissard, After his body was cut first in four peeces, and then consumed with fire, three dayes after his death his friends came to see whether any part of him was remaining, where they found his heart in the ashes whole and unburned.

A Postscript to the Reader. REader, I shall desire thee to consider, that there is something in those Books of mine already pub∣lished of this Argument, viz. in my choice Observations of the Romane Emperors, The Saints Incouragement in Evil Times, where I speak of the Martyrs and Luther, and also in my Bo∣dy of Divinity, where I treat of the best Interpreters of Scripture, which with this I hope will be use∣full for this particular Subject. Joseph Scaliger much disliked the trouble of making a Table or In∣dex. Nam ego malim multis millibus Inscriptionum edendis operam dare, quam vel mediocrem Indicem texere. Scal. Epist. l. 1. Epist. 68. Philippus Iacobus Maussacus in Animadvers. upon Ari∣stotles History de Animalibus, and Julius Scalig. Commentaries near the end hath these words, Plura paraveramus quae omittere coacti sumus, ob Typographorum supinitatem, qui nihil aliud quam errare sciunt: taedet pigetque tot mendorum. I would there were not cause for me to complain like∣wise in this kind. We have not Plantine nor Stevens amongst us. Where one makes use of divers Books besides his own, and the faults in printing be numerous, it is no easie task to specifie the chiefest Errata. I shall mention some things in the general here, and particularize the other Errata after. Wherever Volatterane is quoted Comment.
