To the Honourable the Lords and Commons now assembled in the High Court of Parliament. The humble Petition of the Ʋniversity of Cambridge HUmbly presenteth to your Honourable consideration the sad dejected estate of the said University: How our Schools daily grow desolate, mourning the absence of their Professours and the wonted Auditories: How in our Colledges our numbers grow thinne, and our Revenues short, and that subsistence we have abroad is for the most: part involved in the common miseries: How frighted by the neighbour noise of War, our Students either quit their Gowns or abandon their Studies: How our Degrees lie disesteemed, and all hopes of our publick Commencement are blasted in the bud be∣sides sundry other pressing inconveniences which We forbear to mention. We cannot but conceive your Honourable piety (out of a Noble zeal to Learning) will cordially pity our sad condition, and (as the present generall calamities give way) afford us some succour and en∣couragement. Your Wisdomes best: know what Priviledges and Im∣munities have been in all good times afforded to the seats of Lear∣ning, and the Professors of it; and even in the fury and heat of War, places of Religion and Devotion have usually not onely (on both sides) been spared from ruine, but supported, and esteemed as San∣ctuaries. Hence is it that the Members of our University (by Charter confirmed by Act of Parliament,) stand expressely freed from all pre∣parations and contributions to War: Hence is it, that in neighbour Territories, where the Excise is most: in use, the Universities with all their Students are exempt. May it not therefore be displeasing to your pious wisdomes, if in al humility we crave at your hands a tender commiseration of our case, that you will be pleased to exempt our poore estates from all such Rates and Impositions; to vouchsafe such freedome to our persons (not giving just offence) as may enable us the better to keep toge∣ther and daily to offer up our joynt prayers to God for a blessed union betwixt our Gracious Soveraigne and you, and the blessing of peace upon the Land. This came forth about ye beginnings of March 1643.
