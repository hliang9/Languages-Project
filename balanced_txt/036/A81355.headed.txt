THE DISCRIPTION, Causes, and Discovery, or Symptomes of a Church Papist, or Popish Protestant, which may stand in stead this Yeare, 1642. Which by Reason that this searching Parliament, and won∣derfull Conjunction of happy Planets, hath proved so Sickly and Crazy unto the Romish Constitutions, That it is to be suspected that some of them will flye into Chur∣ches, for Remedy though not for Conversion. London, Printed for J. T. 1642.
The Discription, Causes, and Means of Discoveries or Symptomes of a Church Papist or Popish Protestant. THe Kingdome being lately (praysed bee God) reasonable well purged and cleansed from the open and publike profession, and almost uncontroulable Remedilesse sprea∣ding, Contagion of Idolatry, by the whole∣some, Sage, Mature, and prevalent Reme∣dies of that never sufficiently Renowned Colledge of able Physitians now sitting im Parliament, who by purging some from the Putrifaction of their inveiglement, vomitting up from others their ill conceived rotten humors of inbred indisposednesse towards the welfare of this Church and State, dyetting these with the Supersedeas of Employ∣ment in any nature whatsoever, That so the force of naturall vigor (J meane Jnrellectuall parts) if any were left untainted and not yet turned unto the malignant corruption (as is the nature of that superstitious infection) first, to seize the under∣standing, and to bleare, if not utterly put out reason, shutting up those from comming to Court, or such a distance of, where, for their owne parts it is too manifest what pestilentiall Ve∣nome of Superstition by them was wrought any occasioned, by words, by Smels, by Breath, yea by Letters, Collections, aths, Guifts, Embracings, by placing, feare of displacing, so that not onely the Carbuncles, and Vlcers of Superstition rose upon persons of great Note in Court, whereby it appea∣red that they were strucke with the disease (openly inclining to superstition) and the tokens came forth in great numbers,
declaring that they were desperately, and irrecoverably gone in't, debarring these from the City, whose hopelesse depth in the malady had made them senceles of their sickenesse, yea had cast them into such a Lethargic, that they tooke them∣selves to be the onely sound People, and all the world beside infected, yea to the height of predominacie (within these few yeares) mounted this almost Epidemicall disease, that in not onely seemed stronger them all remedies, but rose a∣gainst, resisted, contrived the ruine and destruction of this wise and Honourable Assembly, and now being mad with a Melancholicke mallice (whereof that disease is very guilty) and posest with an unsatiable desire of tainting others, wher∣unto all infectious distempers are very subject (thinking all that differ from them, condemne them) that they became very dangerous, yea more perillous to others then to them∣selves, threatning subversion to those that would nor permit, but refulsed to proPogate, maintaine, cherish, and foment their Romish Calenture, with Dyet, Aire, Company, and Garments thereto conducing as now no malady forfooth, because generall as well for places where it was, as for per∣sons of quallity taken with it. But the perfect soundnesse and firme sanctity, which this great and honourable Colledge, taking into their deepest consideration, seeing that lenitive and gentle medicines would not take that wished effect, that they all desired it might, and that either the sound and cleere Members must infallibly be drawne into sensible damage, or these peccant humours immediately, taken order with, and so were forced contrary to the mildnesse of their disposition to proceed un∣to sharper remedies; letting some blood with the Lances of their Justice, by the publique Chirurgion, and notable Phle∣botomizer Mr. Grigorie Brandon, a man very well experienc∣ed in that practice, or by applying their cupping Glasses  diligent search and inquisitiue Jntelligence, for the drawing forth the active designes and mischievous plots of others, whereby at the least no dangers might come to others, if no cures could be acquired to them, depriving a third sort of
their meanes and Jnstruments (to wit) their store of Armes plenty of Ammunition, superfluity of Revennues the many props and supporters of that disease, by the helpe whereof they were not onely upon tearmes to have kept up that ma∣lady even after its Cricis, but to have allured others into a partnership of it This course (thankes be first to God and then to the sill of those never enough worthily praysed Artists) hath in a short time, wrought such a Pappy abatement of that plague, that as farre as wee can learne by the weekely Bills of intel∣ligence, it is to outward view of the world, as touching the rage of it, and any feare of suddayne groweth or spreading thereof, cleane ceased, yet the better to compasse the uttter extirpation of it; and be no more annoyed with  knowing that it is the nature of the most viprous disease lthough the head be taken off, and doe not appeare to the Eye) for dread of of the Remedies which are so contrary to it, and which shee hath found for prevalent against it, it may, nay and doth notwithstanding leave some Rellique and some smatch in the Patient, which out of the quallity of that rot∣ten corruption, desires to reside in the body til the next Spring, when perhaps some Plannet may raigne more pro∣pitious unto it, the party thus infected, may be detected, that so either torally cured (which is very hard) by reason of it's Morbus a Traduce, most commonly an hereditary infirmi∣ty taken from Father or Mother, Grandmother, and some∣time a pinne or two higher, and therefore beloved of the child who in an humble blind obedient manner embraceth it because theirs, not because true, or openly descerned and re∣jected, I have though it necessary to give the description of him in this following discourse. A Church Papist, or a close popish Protestant, or if you will an Hippocritticall temporizing festered Romanist, is a Papist lately scared (though not out of that Jdolatry) yet out of the vse, and free exercise of it, by the Weekely Diur∣nals of the proceedings of this Parliament, which he reades and observes more out of reason then affection, which having
well pondered, and how neere he may justly feare they will come up to him, remaining in statu Quo, he presently alte∣reth his Coppie, but not his tenure, his profession, but not his resolution, he leapes into our Church for protection, but not for instruction, for safeguard not salvation, like Cattell that in the heate of Summer betake themselves under Trees for shade, not for pasture, Camelion like he declares no na∣turall colour of his owne, but borroweth it of the standing whereon he is mounted, he comes to the Church to Act, not learne, to be seene that sometimes he is there, not to be Ca∣tachized what he had proffited there, he makes and accounts the Church his Stage, not his Temple, the Preacher his spec∣tator, nor his informer, much lesse his reformer, A Gentle∣man he  be at the least, for if he have not a Roman nose, you may be sure if ever occasion serve, he will make shew, and proofe of a Roman heart, and reasons be hath for what he doth, some whereof may be knowne, some may not, some of which respect Rome, some Westminster, the Pope hath granted him a Bull of dispensation upon these conditions, to heare Masse every day fasting next his heart, securely in his Closset, to maintaine a Priest or Jesuite upon his owne cost, if he be able, if not to contribute so much unto it (according to his Assessement) in his holinesses Vicar Generalls Booke, he shall be found in ability to be constantly the Popes obe∣dient Sonne, in all awefull obsequiousnesse and mentall reser∣vation, Rebus sit stantibus, the Kings loyall Subject, and seeing it would be inconvenient if no disadvantagious unto him; to to shew himselfe otherwise, and not onely to favour, but to further all Stratagems, not in person alone but by Proxie, that he may by the benediction of the Tripled Crowne, the assistance of the Devill and the indefatigablenesse of the Jesuits (those dextorous unmatchable Engineers of Plors, and Hel∣lish practizes) be set a foote againe, for the rearing and re∣payring of this weather beaten Ship of superstition, in the Climaterical yeare of Papacie and Episcopacie. These are the Reasons and Arguments from Rome, that in∣duce him to try what the Jnside of our Church may be made
of, upon the conditions rehearsed, provided, he be well kept, and in points thus Armed and forestalled, why the good La∣dy adviseth him to yeeld to the times for a season until God shall send better dayes, and he is contented to hearken to them, But as the above mentioned causes of dispensetion, and indulgency, perswade and incline, so the reasons from West∣minster drive him thither, The World God be thanked is come to that good passe that they must needs goe, whom the Parliament drives, his estate is at stake, pared and shared al∣ready by the continuall fostering of the Roman Horse-Lee∣ches, whose voyce is still give, give, to whom there not one∣ly goes a continuall Annuity for their proper maintenance here at home, but a large share to Doway and St. Omare a∣broad. But now to pay the King for his Recusancy, his 20. l per moneth, of which, as squares are likely to goe, he hopes for little abatements to pay all Subsidies fifteens, and other Tapes double considering the reason of the great occasions the King hath for money how thicke they come, alas it would make a great hole, (if not cleane digge through) his estate: There∣fore he must venter now to Church, he hath occasion like∣wise unto London, pethaps unto the Queens Court, I doe not say unto her Chappell, The Proclamation for the deparaure of all convict Recusants that refuse to come to Church, at least 15. myles from London; is strict, and the penalty certaine, Therefore he will first goe to Church to satisfie the Procla∣mation, and afterwards about his businesse to London, to Court, or where else, he is none of them the Proclamation mentions, he is excepted. A third cause is by going to Church somewhat perhaps more ordinarily then he needs to doe, he brings himselfe in∣to some confidence with his neighbours in the Countrey, and takes away all suspition and heedfull eyes off from him, no man now so taking notice or observing who they be that comes to him by which means he may carry businesses more cleanly and improve the Catholique cause more coveatly and securely, These be the causes of his admittance into our Church, though hardly into the Congregation.
The causes unknowne, it is not fit we should understand but leave them to himselfe and his Ghostly Father. The Symptomes of such an infected person having nothing about him of soundnesse, but a meere painted species, which are these. You shall be sure to have him constantly at Church upon Holidayes, but seldome or never upon the Sabboth day, he loves a life to heare out all the service, read out by the Cu∣rate at large, and highly commends him for his devout rea∣ding, he thinkes it hath some Assinity with the Masse, and liketh it never the worse for that, when that is ended, he be∣gins to be ill, he hath sate so long in the cold, or bareheaded, and must be excused for not staying the Sermon, he will receive the Communion at the most but once a yeare, and be sure at such a time that the most and best of the Parish shall take notice of him, at what time he will be content (yee with much shew of Infirmity) to heare the Sermon, he likes well of the Protestation, but dares not take it, because there is mention made of the maintaining of the Doctrine of the Church of England, but not of the Discipline which he estee∣meth, equall if not transcendent to the booke of Articles, guessing as he conceives whence it had its Originall. FINIS.
