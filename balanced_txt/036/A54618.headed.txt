OBSERVATIONS UPON THE DVBLIN-Bills of Mortality, 1681. AND THE State of that CITY THE Observations upon the London-Bills of Mortality have been a new Light to the World; and the like Ob∣servation upon those of Dublin, may serve as Snuffers to make the same Candle burn clea∣rer. The London-Observations flowed from Bills regularly kept for near One hundred years; but these are squeezed out of Six stragling London-Bills, out of Fifteen Dub∣lin Bills, and from a Note of the Families and Hearths in each Parish of Dublin; which are all digested into the one Table or Sheet annexed, consisting of Three Parts, markt A, B, C; being indeed the A, B, C, of Publick Oeconomy, and even of that Policy which tends to Peace and Plenty.
Observations upon the Table A. 1. THe Total of the Burials in London, (for the said Six stragling years men∣tioned in the Table A) is 120170; whereof the Medium or Sixth part is 20028; and ex∣ceeds the Burials of Paris, as may appear by the late Bills of that City. 2. The Births, for the same time, are 73683, the Medium or Sixth part whereof is 12280, which is about Five eighth parts of the Bu∣rials; and shews, that London would in time decrease quite away, were it not supplyed out of the Countrey, where are about Five Births for Four Burials, the proportion of Breeders in the Country being greater than in the City. 3. The Burials in Dublin for the said Six years, were 9865, the Sixth part or Medium whereof is, 1644, which is about the Twelfth part of the London-Burials; and about a Fifth part over. So as the people of London do hereby seem to be above Twelve times as many as those of Dublin. 4. The Births in the same time at Dublin, are 6157, the Sixth part or Medium whereof is 1026, which is also about five eighth parts of the 1644 Burials; which shews, that the
proportion between Burials and Births are alike at London and Dublin, and that the Accompts are kept alike; and consequenly are likely to be true, there being no Confe∣deracy for that purpose: Which if they be true, we then say, 5. That the Births are the best way (till the Accompts of the people shall be purpose∣ly taken) whereby to judge of the Increase and Decrease of People, that of Burials being subject to more Contingencies and variety of Causes. 6. If Births be as yet the measure of the People, and that the Births (as has been shewn) are as Five to Eight, then Eight fifths of the Births is the number of the Burials, where the year was not considerable for extraordi∣nary Sickness or Salubrity; and is the Rule whereby to measure the same. As for Ex∣ample: The Medium of Births in Dublin was 1026, the Eight fifths whereof is 1641, but the real Burials were 1644; so as in the said years they differed little from the 1641, which was the Standard of Health; and con∣sequently, the years 1680, 1674, and 1668, were sickly years, more or less, as they ex∣ceeded the said Number 1641; and the rest were healthful years, more or less, as they fell short of the same number. But the City was more or less Populous, as the Births diffe∣red
from the Number 1026; viz. Populous in the years 1680, 1679, 1678, & 1668: For o∣ther causes of this difference in Births, are ve∣ry occult and uncertain. 7. What hath been said of Dublin, serves also for London. 8. It hath already been observ'd by the London-Bills, That there are more Males than Females. It is to be further noted, that in these Six London-Bills also, there is not one in∣stance either in the Births or Burials to the contrary. 9. It hath been formerly observ'd, That in the years wherein most dye, fewest are born, & vice versâ. The same may be further observ'd in Males and Females, viz. When fewest Males are born, then most dye: for here the Males dyed as Twelve to Eleven, which is above the mean proportion of Fourteen to Thirteen; but were born but as Nineteen to Eighteen, which is below the same. Observations upon the Table B. 1 FRom the Table B, it appears, That the Medium of the Fifteen years Burials, (being 24199) is 1613. whereas the Medium of the other six years in the Table A, was 1644, and that the Medium of the Fifteen
years Births (being in all 14765) is 984, whereas the Medium of the said other six years, was 1026. That is to say, there were both fewer Births and Burials in these Fifteen years, than in the other six years; which is a probable sign that at a Medium there were fewer People also. 2. The Medium of Births for the Fifteen years being 984, whereof Eight fifths (being 1576) is the Standard of Health for the said Fifteen years; and the triple of the said 1576, being 4728, is the standard for each of the Ternaries of the Fifteen years within the said Table. 3. That 2952, the triple of 984 Births, is for each Ternary the Standard of Peoples in∣crease and decrease from the year 1666 to 1680 inclusive, viz. The People increased in the second Ternary, and decreased from the same in the Third and Fourth Ternarys, but re-increased in the Fifth Ternary beyond any other. 4. That the last Ternary was withal very healthful, the Burials being but 4624, viz. be∣low 4728, the Standard. 5. That according to this proportion of increase, the Housing of Dublin have proba∣bly increased also.
Observations upon the Table C. 1. FIrst, from the Table C, it appears, 1. That the Housing of Dublin is such, as that there are not five Hearths in each House one with another, but nearer five than four. 2. That in St. Warburghs Parish are near six Hearths to an House. In St. Iohns five. In St. Michaels above five. In St. Nicholas within above six. In Christ-Church above seven. In St. Iames's, and St. Katherines, and in St. Michans, not four. In St. Kevans a∣bout four. 3. That in St. James's, St. Michans, St. Brides, St. Warburgh, St. Andrews, St. Michaels, and St. Patricks, all the Christnings were but 550, and the Burials 1055, viz. near double; and that in the rest of the Parishes the Christnings were five, and the Burials seven, viz. as 457 to 634. Now whether the cause of this difference were negligence in Accompts, or the greaterness of the Families, &c. is worth inquiring. 4. It is hard to say in what order (as to greatness) these Parishes ought to stand, some having most Families; some most Hearths, some most Births, and others most Burials. Some Parishes exceeding the rest in two,
others in three of the said four particulars, but none in all four. Wherefore this Table ranketh them according to the plurality of the said four particulars wherein each excel∣leth the other. 5. The London-Observations reckon eight heads to be in each Family; according to which estimation, there are 32000 Souls in the 4000 Families of Dublin; which is but half of what most Men imagine; of which but about one sixth part are able to bear Arms, besides the Royal Regiment. 6. Without the knowledge of the true number of People, as a Principle, the whole scope and use of the keeping Bills of Births and Burials is impaired; wherefore by labo∣rious Conjectures and Calculations to deduce the number of People from the Births and Bu∣rials, may be Ingenious, but very preposte∣rous. 7. If the number of Families in Dublin be about 4000, then Ten Men, in one week (at the Charge of about Five pound, Surveying Eight Families in an hour) may directly, and without Algebra, make an Accompt of the whole People, expressing their several Ages, Sex, Marriages, Title, Trade, Religion, &c. and those who survey the Hearths, or the Constables or Parish Clarks, (may, if requi∣red) do the same ex Officio, and without o∣ther
Charge, by the Command of the Chief Governor, the Diocesan, or the Mayor. 8. The Bills of London have since their beginning, admitted several Alterations and Improvements; and eight or ten pound per annum surcharge, would make the Bills of Dublin to exceed all others, and become an excellent Instrument of Government. To which purpose the Forms for Weekly, Quar∣terly, and Yearly Bills are humbly recom∣mended, viz.
A POSTSCRIPT TO THE STATIONER. WHereas you complain, that these Observations make no sufficient Bulk, I could answer you, That I wish the Bulk of all Books were less; but do never-the-less comply with you in adding what follows, viz. 1. That the Parishes of Dublin are very unequal; some having in them a∣bove Six hundred Families, and others under Thirty. 2. That Thirteen Parishes are too few for Four thousand Families; the midling Parishes of London containing One hundred and twenty Families; ac∣cording
to which rate, there should be about Thirty three Parishes in Dublin. 3. It is said, that there are Eighty four thousand Houses or Families in London, which is Twenty one times more than are in Dublin; and yet the Births and Burials of London are but Twelve times those of Dublin: which shews, that the Inhabitants of Dublin are more crowded and streightned in their Housing, than those of London; and consequently, that to increase the Buildings of Dublin, will make that City more conformable to London. 4. I shall also add some Reasons for altering the present forms of the Dub∣lin-Bills of Mortality, according to what hath been here recommended, viz. 1. We give the distinctions of Males and Females in the Births onely; for that the Burials must, at one time or an∣other; be in the same proportion with the Births.
2. We do in the Weekly and Quarterly Bills propose, that notice be taken in the Burials of what numbers dye above Sixty and Seventy, and what under Sixteen, Six, and Two years old; foreseeing good uses to be made of that distinction. 3. We do in the Yearly Bill, reduce the Casualties to about Twenty four, being such as may be discerned by common sense and without Art; con∣ceiving that more will but perplex and imbroil the Account. And in the Quarterly Bills, we reduce the Diseases to Three Heads, viz. Contagious, A∣cute, and Chronical; applying this di∣stinction to Parishes, in order to know how the different Scituation, Soil, and way of living in each Parish, doth dis∣pose Men to each of the said Three Species: and in the Weekly Bills we take notice not only of the Plague, but of the other Contagious Diseases in each Parish; that strangers and fear∣ful
Persons may thereby know how to dispose of themselves. 4. We mention the Number of the People, as the Fundamental Term in all our proportions; and without which, all the rest will be almost fruitless. 5. We mention the number of Mar∣riages made in every Quarter, and in every year; as also the proportion which Married Persons bear to the whole; expecting in such Observations to read the improvement of the Nation. 6. As for Religions, we reduce them to Three, viz. 1. Those who have the Pope of Rome for their Head. 2. Who are Governed by the Laws of their Coun∣try. 3. Those who rely respectively upon their own private Judgments. Now whether these distinctions should be taken notice of or not, we do but faintly recommend, seeing many Rea∣sons pro and con for the same: and therefore although we have mentioned it as a matter fit to be considered, yet we humbly leave it to Authority.
FURTHER OBSERVATION UPON THE Dublin-Bills: OR, ACCOMPTS OF THE Houses, Hearths, Baptisms, And Burials in that CITY. The Second Edition, Corrected and Enlarg'd. By Sir WILLIAM PETTY, Fellow of the Royal Society. LONON: Printed for Mark Pardoe, at the Sign of the Black Raven, over-against Bed∣ford-House in the Strand. 1686.
The STATIONER TO THE READER. I Have not thought fit to make any Altera∣tion of the first Editi∣on, but have only added a New Table with Observa∣tion upon it, placing the same in the front of what was before; which perhaps might have been as well placed after the like Table at the 8th Page of the first Edition.
DUBLIN. 1682. Parishes. Houses. Fire-places. Baptiz'd. Buri'd. St. Iames 272 836 122 306 St. Katherines 540 2198 St. Nicholas with-out, and St. Patricks 1064 4082 145 414 St. Bridgets 395 1903 68 149 St. Audones 276 1510 56 164 St. Michael 174 884 34 50 St. Iohns 302 1636 74 101 St. Nicholas within, and Christ-Church Lib. 153 902 26 52 St. Warbors 240 1638 45 105 St. Michans 938 3516 124 389 St. Andrews 864 3638 131 300 St. Kevans 554 2120 87 233 Donobrook 253 506   6025 25▪369 912 2263 Further Observations upon the Dublin Accompts of Baptisms and Burials, Houses and Hearths, viz. THe Table hath been made for the Year 1682, wherein is to be noted,
1. That the Houses which Anno 1671, were but 3850 are Anno 1682, 6025; but whether this difference is caused by the real encrease of Hou∣sing, or by fraud and defect in the for∣mer Accompts, is left to considerati∣on. For the Burials or People have increased but from 1696, to 2263, according to which proportion, the 3850 Houses Anno 1671, should Anno 1682 have been but 5143, wherefore some fault may be suspected as afore∣said, when Farming the Hearth-mony was in agitation. 2. The Hearths have encreased according to the Burials, and ⅓ of the said increase more, viz. The Burials Anno 1671 were 1696, the ⅓ where∣of is 563, which put together makes 2259, which is near the number of Burials Anno 1682. But the Hearths Anno 1671, were 17500, whereof the ⅓ is 5833, making in all but 23333; whereas the whole Hearths
Anno 1682 were 25369, viz. ⅓ and better of the said 5833 more. 3. The Housing were Anno 1671, but 3850, which if they had encrea∣sed Anno 1682 but according to the Burials, they had been but 5143, or according to the Hearths, had been but 5488, whereas they appear 6025, encreasing double to the Hearths. So as 'tis likely there hath been some errour in the said Account of the Housing, unless the new Housing be very small, and have but one Chimney apiece, and that ¼ part of them are untenan∣ted. On the other hand, 'tis more like∣ly that when 1696 dy'd per An. there were near 6000; for 6000 Houses at 8 Inhabitants per House, would make the number of the People to be 48 Thousand, and the number of 1696 that died according to the Rule of One out of 0, would have made the number of Inhabitants about 50 Thou∣sand: For which reason I continue to
believe there was some Errour in the Accompt of 3850 Houses as aforesaid, and the rather because there is no ground from experience to think that in 11 year, the Houses in Dublin have encreased from 3850 to 6025. Moreover, I rather think that the number of 6025 is yet short, because that number at 8 heads per House makes the Inhabitants to be but 48200; whereas the 2263 who died in the year 1682, according to the afore∣mention'd Rule of one dying out of 30 makes the number of People to be 67890; the Medium betwixt which number and 48200 is 58045, which is the best estimate I can make of that matter, which I hope Authority will ore long rectifie, by direct and exact Enquiries. 4. As to the Births, we say that Anno 1640, 1641, and 1642▪ at Lon∣don, just before the Troubles in Reli∣gion began, the Births were ⅚ of the
Burials, by reason I suppose of the greaterness of Families in London a∣bove the Country, and the fewer Breeders, and not for want of Regi∣string. Wherefore deducting ⅙ of 2263, which is 377, there remains 1886 for the probable number of Births in Dublin for the year 1682; whereas but 912 are represented to have been Christen'd in that year, though 1023 were Christen'd Anno 1671, when there died but 1696; which decreasing of the Christnings, and increasing of the Burials, shews the increase of Non-registring in the Legal Books, which must be the increase of Roman Catholicks at Dublin. The scope of this whole Paper there∣fore is, That the People of Dublin are rather 58000, than 32000; and that the Dissenters, who do not Register their Baptisms, have encreased from 391 to 974: but of Dissenters, none
have increased but the Roman Catho∣licks, whose Numbers have encrea∣sed from about 2 to 5 in the said Years. The exacter Knowledge whereof, may also be better had from direct Enquiries. FINIS.
