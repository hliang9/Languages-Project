TRUE ACCOUNT OF THE BEHAVIOUR, CONFESSIONS, AND Last Dying Words, OF Capt. James Watts, Capt. Peter Barnwell, Daniel D' Coiner alias Walker, Richard Jones, and Jane Voss alias Roberts, who were Executed AT TYBURN, On the 19th of December 1684. for Robbing on the High way High Treason, Murther, and Fellony, &c. Printed by Order, &c. SAD it is and much to be Lamented, that Persons Indued with Reason and Understanding, should abandon themselves to such Vices, as promt them to their Ruine, no greater Instance of which can at any time appear, than what is contained in the following pages, being an Im∣partial Account of the Sufferings, &c. of Five Notorious Malefactors, viz. James Watts, Peter Barnwell, Daniel De Coiner alias Walker, Richard Jones, and Jane Voss alias Roberts, and of these their former manner of Life, Behaviour, and Penitency, Last Dying Words, &c. as they come in Order. James Watts and Peter Barnwell, were Persons well Descended and Born, espe∣cially the former to plentiful Estates, but early leaving their Parents, and despi∣sing those ways they proposed for their happy subsistance, and being grown up to years of Maturity, addicted themselves to the Modish Gallantry of the Town, and to maintain their Grandure, and keep their Extravagant Humour at Height,
and spent so profusely, that in the end, though by different ways they came to Acrisis, yet having Worthy Friends, they procured Places of Command abroad, in the Quality of Captains, being by that means a long time absent, but their Companies Disbanded they again return'd, and became great Company Keepers, fre∣quenting Gaming, Ordinaries, and such places of Resort; till at last they were taken at Chelsey, and brought to Newgate, for Robbing Richard Winlow on the Highway, on the 16th of September 1684 near Stoaking-Church, and taking from him and his Wife, a Gelding value 10 l. together with a Saddle, Money, Beads, Rings, Scarves, and a Handkerchief, which being proved against them the last Sessions, they were Convicted, and received Sentence of Death, when being recon∣veyed to Newgate, by their Friends they earnestly laboured for a Pardon, ap∣pearing much dejected, and very desirous to live, promising Amendment of Life, and behaving themselves very meekly, giving great attention to those that Instru∣cted them and their Fellow Convicts, in matters relating to Salvation; owning severally, that they had been grievous Sinners, and were Concious of many No∣torious Crimes of which they heartily repented, desiring the Pious Prayers of all good Christians, and so from day to day as opportunity offered, they continued to consult, Mr. Ordinary and other Divines (that out of a Charitable Inclination came to visit them) about their Immortal Wellfare, till the Fatal Day came, whereon they Suffered. Being put into A Cart together, they were with the rest Conveyed to the place of Execution, where Ct. Watts boldly declared with much Resolution, this willingness to dy reproving a Gentleman for his needless sorrow, who seemed greatly concern∣ed at his misfortune, telling him he was altogether willing, and as he hoped pre∣pared for Death, yet would have the Spectators take warning by his untimely and disgraceful End, which he had often deserved, but now it was Gods pleasure, and not till now, to bring him to it, wherefore he as willingly submitted to the pun∣ishment, being asked by a Divine, What Religion he dyed in, he answered in the A∣postolick Catholick Religion, according to the Church of England as by Law Established, dying in Charity with all Men, and believing all the Articles of the Christian Faith, hoping in, and relying on, the merits of his dear Redeemer, Ac∣knowledging that Mr. Ordinary as likewise other Divines had taken great pains with him, and again expressed, a willingness to dy, uttering his words very Charefully. Capt. Barnwel by Birth, an Irish Man born in the County of Dublin, with a loud voice, desired the People who thronged in great Numbers to see him dy, that they would take Example by him, and above all, beware of bad Company, which had brought him to that place, for he had unhappily fallen into the Society of such as had ruined him, little considering at that time the fatal consequences that attended such a misfortune, often requesting all that heard him, to let him be a warning to them, and that by his Example they would be warned not to be lead away under specious pretences of Friend ship, or hopes of gain, adding he never took any thing out of any Mans Pocket by violence, or used him ungently, nor would he absolutely own his being at the Robery, but being newly come to Town, he was about to depart for Ireland, but falling into the Company of di∣vers Persons, who made some overtures to him, he was detained and frequent∣ed their haunts till the time he was taken, yet desired God to forgive all those through whose means he fell into the misery he was to undergo, Professing him self a Roman Catholick, and that he dyed in the Communion of the Church of Rome, saying he and all his Family and Relations were Loyal to their King, de∣sireing those that heard him to be so likewise. Imploreing Gods Blessing on the King and Kingdom, as also upon his Royal Highness and the rest of the Roy∣al Progeny, wishing he had a Thousand Lives to loose for them, and many times repeating his misfortune; was occasioned through his Associating himself with bad Company, and as often desired the Auditors to take notice, he dyed a Roman Ca∣tholick, and hoped for Salvation, through the Blood of Jesus Christ, alledging, he did not lately choose or embrace that Religion, but had been all along, or at least most part of his days brought up in it. Daniel D' Coiner a Frenchman by Birth, and a Native as he confessed of Brit∣tany, a Province of that Kingdom, having Travelled into divers Parts, and much addicted himself to Study the Nature of Mettals, at length came to Paris, where
he undertook to Refine and Guild Coarse Mettals, reducing them to a greater Value, getting thereby considerably, but not so content having received Instructi∣ons from one of his Companions, he procured Stamps and other Materials, for Coining counterfeit Money resembling Gold and Silver, and soon grew expert at the trade, so that having put divers cheats upon the Tradesmen and Merchants, and his practices beginning to be discovered, he some years since came for Eng∣land with his Wife, and altering his Name to that of Walker, fell to Coining En∣glish Monies, as Guinneys, Half Guinneys, Mill'd Crowns, and Half Crowns, &c. and found means by the assistance of several Persons no honester than himself, to put away great quantities, allowing them considerably for their disposing them, as Guinnies at 10 s. a piece, and 25 s. of his Counterfeit Mill'd Money to the pound, viz. for 20 s. good, but in the height of his security, as he was preparing for Ireland, to put a cheat upon that Kingdom (as well he might for his pieces were so nearly resembling the true ones, that they would deceive the skillful) he was discovered by one of his accomplices, and a considerable quantity of the Counterfeits, together with all his Implements taken, so that being brought upon his Tryal, although he denyed the active Coining, as likewise, the Clipping of King Charles the First's Half Crowns, and Queen Elizabeth shillings, upon plain proofs he was found Guilty of the former, though not of the latter, his Wife who was Tryed with him being Acquitted of both. Receiving Sentence to be Drawn, Hang'd and Quartered, he was carryed back to Newgate, and gave himself up to Melancholy, much bewailing his unhappy state, yet greatly flattering himself with hopes of a Pardon, for that he had dis∣covered divers Clippers and Coiners, and amongst the rest George Clark and his Wife, who were Convicted upon his and other Evidence, and that if he might Live, he said he would make greater discoveries, but the Warrant being Signed for his Execution, and he desired to be mindful of the Approaching day of his Dissolution, and not vainly flatter himself with hopes of Life; he betook him fer∣vently to Prayer, confessing he had been a great Sinner, and that he had deceiv∣ed many Hundreds, to whom he was not capable of making restitution, desiring God to take pity on him, and not to lay his sins to his Charge, and that he would find a means to provide for his poor Wife, whom his Miscarriages had ruined, and so continued very sensible of Deaths near approach. Arriving at the place of Execution in a Sledge, and there put into the Cart he was tyed up apart from the rest, and strictly Examined, who with a low Voice, con∣fessed his Guilt, and desired God to Pardon him; saying, it was for wicked Lucre sake, that he Committed that great Wickedness, imploring those present to Pray for him, and joyn with him in Prayer, in order to recommend his Soul to the Searcher of all Hearts, that his Iniquities might be Pardoned and done away, and thereupon he Prayed to himself with up lifted Hands, which he was observed to do, even to the latest moment of his Life, desiring all Persons that they would avoid the Sin of Covetousness, which too often proves a snare to the Soul, and had brought him to shame and confusion, yet he willingly submitted, and forgave those that had brought him to the Place, where he was to Suffer. Richard Jones a Notorious Liver, known to be concerned in many Robberies, and reputed to be of a profuse Life from his Childhood, sorting himself with di∣vers of no better Fame, and after many escapes for small matters emboldened to greater Mischief, it appeared he had observed the dwelling of Elizabeth Fairbank an Antient Woman in Pickadlly, and finding she was considerably well to pass, a Plot was laid against her Life, to get her Money and what else was of Value, nor studied the Conspirators long, how to put their resolves in practice, for on the Fatal 20th of April last, the aforesaid Richard Jones, Charles Tooly, and John Wise, entring somewhat late, under pretence of Drinking or some such like occa∣sion, two of them Murthered her by twisting her Neck, stopping her Mouth with Handkerchiefs, and brusing her in divers places, whilst the other stood Centry, and taking all they thought convenient fled; but the Murther being rumored a∣broad, and the Murtherers Guilty Consciences accusing them, they Fled into Hol∣land and Flanders, the Prisoner saying, if he was taken he should Dye for it, it appearing, he had been Burnt in the Hand formerly, for stealing Perukes, but Tooly dying beyond the Seas, and Guilty Consciences still haunting the other Par∣ties, they could not rest till they returned, when Tooly's Wife disclosing the Murther, and what happened thereupon, John Wise was the last Quarter-Sessions
Condemned and Executed, and Richard Jones since taken Condemned and Senten∣ced the Sessions following, not being able to make any considerable defence, tho he faintly denyed the Fact, Sentence of Death past, and he remanded, he appear∣ed much dejected as being out of all hopes of a Pardon, his Crime being too ha∣nious to admit of Mercy, wherefore Mr. Ordinary and divers other Ministers la∣boured with him to bring him to a right understanding of the sad condition he was in, which mischief his sins had brought upon him &c. to whose advice he seriously hearke∣ning seemed greatly concerned about Eternal matters relating to the Salvation of his Soul, asking as an illiterate person, many questions and satisfying himself as much as he was capable in the Mistery of the future state &c. At the Place of Execution, being urged to confess the Murther, not only by Mr. Ordinary, but by Jane Voss his Fellow Sufferer, and likewise his Father in Law he answered doubtfully to their demands, although they reitterated their intrea∣ties, laying before him the danger of Concealing a known Crime, and minding him he shortly must appear before his Maker, yet could they not get the secret from him, although he appeared very Penitent, Praying often and desiring the Pray∣ers of others, and that God would pardon his sins, and forgive all his Trespasses, as he freely forgave the whole World, submitting to what the Law had allotted, owning he had many great and grievous Crimes, that had called down vengeance on him, and that Gods Judgments had justly overtaken him. Jane Ʋoss alias Roberts, so notorious for shoplifting and other Roberies of the like nature, that to name her might be enough to give the Reader a Character of her life whose frequent felonies and often Convictions have made her known to most in and about London, she having been above 12 times in Newgate, and several times Condemned to dye, &c. but the Fatal one happened in April last, for stealing a Tankard, &c. when using her former Artifices, in hopes to gain time in order to procure a Pardon, she having drunk about a Gallon of New Ale and Honey, Pleaded her Belly, and upon inquiry of Women, was returned to be with quick Child, but lying in Newgate and no such thing appearing, she was brought to the Sessions House the last Sessions, and ordered to be Executed on her former Sen∣tance, upon which being much consternated, she used many endeavours to pro∣cure a Reprieve or Pardon, applying her self by her Friends to several Persons of Quality, but her Offences being so many and former Grace and Mercy, not being of force to Reclaim her, no place was found for such a favour, which she perceiving, greatly lamented her unhappy state, and promised amendment if her days might be prolonged, desiring the Prayers of all good People, but above all, grieved that she had been the cause of many falling into bad courses, which had brought them to untimely ends, for according to report no less than 7 Persons, whom had passed for her Husbands, have at several times been Executed for Ro∣beries, &c. the fatal day come, and she brought to the Place appointed. Being asked, how she found her self as to her Eternal state, she chearfully answer∣ed never better, for through Christs Merits, and a firm Relyance on him by Faith, she doubted not of her Salvation; saying, it was true she was a great Sinner, and had many times narrowly escaped, but now it was come home to her, and yet death was not so terrible, as she formerly supposed it, adding, that she had once some hopes of a Pardon, but that vanishing, she betook her self more ear∣nestly to Prayer, and that her conscience told her, God had heard her, and had Compassion on her, and that it was a Mercy she had so much time to repent. Thus far each having had free Licence to speak, &c. Mr. Ordinary Prayed earnestly with them, as likewise did several other Divines then present, admonish∣ing them to recommend their Souls into the Hands of their Merciful Redeemer, when (after the Captains had disposed of what they thought fit to their Friends, and desired to be Buried both in one Grave, the Psalme likewise sung) the Cart drew away, leaving them in the Armes of Death to pass into a vast Eternity, in hopes of a Life more lasting, than that which Justice had deprived them off, for their Offences. Whereas since the last Sessions there have been Published divers false accounts of the Execution of the Prisoners, pretended to be their last Confessions when indeed Printed be∣fore they went to be Executed, These are Therefore to give notice that the true account Printed by Order will come forth for the Future, in The name of the Publisher hereof the Morning after the said Executions, which is as soon as any true account can be Printed.
