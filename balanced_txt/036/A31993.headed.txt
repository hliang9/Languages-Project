HUNTINGTON 15o Martii. 1641: ¶ His Majesties Message to both Houses of Parliament, upon His Removall to the City of YORK. HIs Maiesty being now in His Remove to His City of Yorke, where he intends to make His Residence for some time, thinks fit to send this Message to both Houses of Parliament; That He doth very earnestly desire, That they will use all possible industrie, in expediting the businesse of Ireland, in which they shall finde so cheerfull a Con∣currence by His Maiesty, that no inconvenience shall happen to that Service by His ab∣sence, He having all that Passion for the reducing of that Kingdom, which He hath expres∣sed in His former Messages, and being unable by words to manifest more affection to it then He hath endeavoured to do by those Messages (having likewise done all such Acts as He hath been moved unto by His Parliament) therefore, if the misfortunes and Calamities of His poor Protestant Subjects there shall grow upon them (though his Maiesty shall be deeply concerned in, and sensible of their suffrings) He shall wash his hands before all the World, from the least imputation of slacknesse in that most necessary and pious Work. And that His Maiestie may leave no way unattempted, which may beget a good under∣standing between Him and his Parliament, he thinks it necessary to Declare, That as he hath been so tender of the Priviledges of Parlament, that He hath been ready and forward to retract any Act of his own, which he hath been informed hath Trencht upon their Priviled∣ges, so he expects an equall tendernesse in then of his Maiesties known and unquestionable Priviledges (which are the Priviledges of the Kingdome) amongst which he is assured it is a fundamentall One, That His Subjects cannot be Obliged to Obey any Act, Order, or Iniunction, to which his Majesty hath not given his consent: And therefore He thinks it necessary to publish, that he expects, and hereby Requires Obedience from all His loving Subjects to the Laws established, and that they presume not upon any pretence of Order, or Ordinance (to which His Maiesty is no Partie) concerning the Militia, or any other thing, to do or execute what is not warranted by those Laws, his Maiesty being resolved to keep the Laws himselfe, and to require Obedience to them from all his Subjects. And His Maiestie once more recommends to his Parliament the substance of His Message of the 20th of Ianuary last, that they compose and digest, with all speed, such Acts, as they shall think fit, for the present and future establishment of their Priviledges; The free and quiet enjoying their Estates and Fortunes; The Liberties of their Persons; The security of the true Religion now professed in the Church of England; The maintaining his Maiesties Regall and iust Authority, and setling his Revenue; His Majesty being most desirous to take all fitting and iust wayes which may beget a happie understanding between him and his Parliament, in which he conceives his greatest power and riches doth consist.
