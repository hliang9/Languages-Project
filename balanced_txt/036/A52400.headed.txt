HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT royal blazon or coat of arms ORDERS To be Observed at the CORONATION OF THE KING and QUEEN. Published by Order of the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Mar∣shal of England, &c. THese are to give notice to all the Peers, and Peeresses, that are to Attend in the Proceeding at the Coro∣nation of the KING and QUEEN, on the 23d. day of this instant April, That it is His Majesty's plea∣sure, that They, and every of Them, forbear to set, or use, any Jewels, or precious Stones, in their Coronets. And whereas Coach-makers, Carvers, Embroiderers, Painters, or other Artificers, do presume (both upon Coaches, and in making the Coronets for this present Coronation) to raise the Pearls of the Barons and Baronesses Coronets, upon Pins, or Spikes, (whereas they ought to lie flat upon the Rimm, or Ring, of the Coronet.) This is to warn all such Workmen from the like Error, and to Enjoyn and Order them to take care to make all such Coronets exactly as they are allowed to be worn, (by the Grant from the late King CHARLES the Second of Blessed Memory) as they will Answer the contrary at their Perils. And it is also Ordered, That no Person whatsoever (that shall be present at the said Coronation, either Attending the Pro∣ceeding, or as Spectators,) do appear in Mourning Habit for that Day. I do appoint these Orders to be Printed. Given under my Hand the 7th. day of April, 1685. Norfolk and Marshal. London: Printed for John Smith, Bookseller in Covent-Garden, 1685.
