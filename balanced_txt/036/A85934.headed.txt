BALTAZAR GERBIER KNIGHT TO ALL MEN THAT LOVES TRVTH
BALTHAZAR GERBIER KNIGHT. To all men that Loues Truth. THe Diuine pecopts of Christ forbidd men to Iudge one an∣nother, Iudgment belongs to God, and to none else; for he saith IVDGMENT IS MINE: It pleaseth God to suffer my Parents to fly the bluddy per∣secutions in France against those vvhich the Roman Catholikes called then  My said Parents left and lost all for that cause; My Father Anthoine Gerbier vvas a genthleman borne, and had a Baronnie in Notmandie; My Mother vvas Radegonde, daugh∣ter jn Ayre to the Lord of Blayet in Picardie; I vvas borne; att Middelbourg in Zelandt, vvhence I vvas (by one of my Brothers) transported into France, and thence retur∣ned; and about  tuinty one past (in the company of Noël Caron then Hollndt Ambassadeur) into England; vvhere I applied myselfe to George Villiers, nevvly become fauorit to King Ieames, the said George Villiers, being immediatly after Baron, Viscount Earle, and aftervvards created Marquis and Duke of Buckingham. My attendance vvas pleasing to him, bijcause of my seuerall languages, good hand in vvriting:, skill in sçiences, as Mathe∣maticks, Architecture, dravving, painting, contryuing of scenes, Marques, shovvs and entertainments for greate Princes, besides many  vvhich I had gathered from diuers rare persons, as likvve, for making of Engins usfull in vvarre, as I made those vvhich might blovve vpp the Dike that stopt the passage to the Tovvne of Rochell, for it vvas on the same Modell of that of the Prince of Parms vvhen the attempt vvas on Antvverpe; He did puts to me first, the contryuance of some of his habitations, to chouse fort him rarities, bookes, medals, marble
of mony, of vvhich I neuer vvould hane the managing. I did keepe his Cifers vvith his jntelligences abroade, vvas sent by him (vvith the king his Masters aprobation) in secret Messages; No sooner vvere those markes of trust obserued, butt mali∣cious Ignorant persons made glosses theron, according the places vvere I vvas sent: My first publike inployment abroade vvas a iourney into Holland, to meete theire an Eminent person from Brabant vvho vvas to make ouuertures from Spaine and Germanie for the restitution of the Palatinat; I vvent att that same justant jnto Tessei and assisted Sr. Sackville Trevers, to gett cleere from the Eastindian Company theire dessigne vvhich vvas to stay him vvith the Shipp called the S. Esprit, vvhere vviht he made aftervvards for England: My second jmployment vvas jn France, to expostulate vviht the Cardinall de Richelieu, concerning large promisses France had made to assist Count Mansfelt, vvhen king Ieames vvas mouued to engage him selfe on theire faie promisses againts Spaine; vvhi¦ch assistance prouued att last butt bare Cabinet discourses, and no reall engagement of that king nor Ministers of state: vvhich seemed to vexc Count Mansfelt art my returne to Douer▪ and se∣med to mouve him to desire that I should say to King Ieames, that he had keijes to make his one passage through France, iff the king vvould giue him leaue, though it vvas a question vvhe∣ther Count Mansfelt ment it, for he neuer had any ottaine pro∣misse of a reall conjonction nor assistance of the french: his Tresorier then (for shovve) only did passe aquittances to the french; the∣reby to persuade king Ieames that the jntended vvare for the Palatinat should not vvholly lay on his charge: I vvas aftervvards jmployed againe jnto Brabant, vvhere I vvas commanded to comune vvith the Marquis Spinola about the re∣concilliation betvveene the Crovvne of England and Spaine, on vvhich secret conference the treaty vvas sett on foot; and pursued vntill it vvas braught to à conclusion: I vvas jmploied jnto France to remonstrate the greate jncon∣ueniencies of theire countenancing of the Spanish trade, for
that theire shipping did transportte all the Spanish Marchandise, and thereby frustrated the king of England of those hopes (du∣ring the breach betvveene the tvvo Crovvnes after the desoluing of the tvvo Treaties of the Spanish match, and that of the Pa∣latinat) the Spaniards might haue been put to it, and thereby mouued to giue fitt satisfaction on the point of the Palatinat: I vvas likvveise imployed by the King to remonstrate to the French King and to the then Queene Mother, the mistakes of the French Ambassador Monsieur de Blinuille; vvhen his men vsed violence on the Kings Officers, Constables and others that did theire Duty, to hinder the scandalous resort of English Papists att Durham house: I did then deliuer to the Cardinall des Richelieu a letter of the Duke of Buckingham, vvhich vvas by some taken for the cause and begining of mis-intellgences betvvene the tvvo Crovvnes of England and France, because those tvvo greate fauorits did then declare theire ressents; vvhich vvere so violently vttered on the Car∣dinall de Richelieu side, as that hee accompanied them vvith unciuill glosses, vvho gaue ground to some licencious discour∣ses, vvhich did so little vvorck on me (that had not other North∣starre then his Majesties seruices and my duty) as mouued mee to proceed as befitted a person sent on good grounds, and to make apparant to the haughty spiritt of that Cardinall that threats vvere to vveake to driue me from my byas, nor could his compliments after∣vvards vvork any other effect on me (vvhen he desired my toturne) then to mouue me to heare him, and to relate his vtterances vvhich concluded vvith compliments that he contented himselfe to knovve the fame of a fauorit so great as the Duke of Buckingham vvas, but for him only to act the part of a single Mi∣nister of state; vvho did admire the povver of the Canon of an English Admirall, but that hee him selfe did remaine in th hu∣mility of the Canons of that Church vvhereof he vvas a Disciple, and as those vtterances vvhere indeed butt flovvers of Rethorice, they coueted serpents, for he caused men to follovv me to the very port of Bollogne▪ vvhere the foldiers vvere apointed to ceasse on all my papers, butt he vvas disapointed, for I gott safe into England: I vvas aftervvards commanded tovvards Spaine, on an invitatin
from that King and a Passe sent for my safe Landing▪ In any of CANTABRIA, it vvas to proceede to the intended Treaty of reconcilliation betvvene the tvvo Crovvnes; butt an Irish bleed Eyd Papist Priest vvas sett on by Mr. Endimion Porter to make the Duke of Buckingham beleeue that the Conde-Duch d'Oliuaras the king of Spaines fauorit desired the said Mr. Porter to be sent on that Treaty, vvhich prouued but a plot of the said Mr Porter, as apeared by his proceedings, for after he got the Duke of Bukinghams consent to go allong vvith them and the Abot d'Es∣caillie (then Ambssad from the Duke of Savoye) no sooner vvere vvee arriued at Bruxels butt the said Mr. Porter (vvith out knovvledge of the said Abot d'Escalie, lesse of me) repaired secretly to the Arch Duchesse Infame Isabells, and to Don Carlot Colom, to contrice his disguised passage into Spaine, vvithout the said Abot d'Ecaille and my selfe vvich he undertooke after hee left me on my vvay from Bruxelles to Nmur, and his returne to Bruxelles, though he had neither Comission nor any letter of Credence, for I did pocesse them, therefore his said secret journey into Spaine prouued most ridiculous, and his appearance to that Court vvas ta∣ken by the Conde-Duca as an argument of vveaknesse in those that had sent him▪ that had no letters of credit. It vvas from that instant that I became an Eye-sore to the English Spanish faction vvich vvas maintayned by the Lord Cotinghton; some of them caused a most malicious and horride asperssion to be cast on me supposing by theire letters to the Lord of Carlile (his Ma∣jesties extraordinary Ambassador in Itallie in the yeare 1628.) that I vvas sent that vvay about (on a pretence to go to Spaine) only to kill him by the vvay; of which horrid asperssion the said Lord of Carlille vvas pleased to giue me notice; and on my just essent decla∣red in his Maiesties presence, that hee neuer had any cause to credit that foulle report: yet did the Authors thereoff continue their malice against mee by theire ill Offices during my Bleuen yeares Residency in his Majesties service in the Court of Bruxels; re∣turning copies to the Spanish ministers off all the of most Impor∣tant advertissements vvhich I did sent to the King and State. And as those malicious persons seemed to ayme to haue me and myne distroyed in that Residency, they endeauoured no lesse than the distruction of his Maiesties seruice, his Interest honnor;
that of the Nation, and the interest of the best and most assured Friends and Allies of the State of England. This they did on diuers notable occasions: First, vvhen by their maintayning the Spanish, scarce any of his Maiesties subiects could get Iustice in the Admirallitie Courts of Brabant and Flan∣dres, vvhen diuers of his Maiesties subiets might haue been timly re∣least, their perssons and goods freed from distruction, diuers of them suffered therein by the insolency of their aduersse parties fauoured by the Spanish faction in England. Secondly, They crost many faire occasions concerning the Palatinat, by returning to some of the ill disposed Spanish mini∣sters of state such secret aduertissements as I had sent into England and vvhich I had in confidency from the Emperors Resident, the Duk of Neevvg, the Prince Elector of Treue▪ and the Resident of Collen: The said English Spanish affected, aduertissed the Mar∣quis d'Ayton that the Infanta Isabella Arch-Duchesse had honnored mee vvith a secret declaration that shee vvould put Franckendall into the Queene of Bohemias hands. This they returned by one Iohn Taylier (an English Papist, vvho formerly had been by the English Spanish faction, imployed into Germanie) by vvhich auertissements the Infants for her good vvill to∣vvards the Queene of BOHEMIA vvas braught into question, and that businesse vtterly distroyed, vvhich then I did manifest to Old Sir Iohn Coke, then Secretary of State: and that I had vvit∣nesses hovv the said Iohn Tayler confest his faute for hauing con∣ferred vvith the said Marquis dAyton, Contrary to his Instru∣ions, receaued from the King and the Secretary of State▪ vvich he confest a month after his arriuall att Bruxels, that he had kept sir Iohn Cokes letter to mee in his pocket untill the said bu∣sines of Franckendall vvas distroyed, he said that the Cottintoniens had forbid him to go a long vvith me to the Spanish ministers. Thirdly, They returned to the Court of Bruxels the Copie of a great dispatch vvherein I manifested to the King and to the Secretary of State all vvhat the Catholike States (both Spirituall and Temporall) had resolued in their trance, that those Prouinces vvere in hazard to be conquered. By vvhich cetune of Advertissement vvas vvrought the distruction of the famillies of the Duke of Ascot, Prince of Espinoy, Barban∣son,
Duke or  and o Count Egmond: One Iean de Vi∣ualde (that had been Secretary to van-Malle for the Space of 1 years in England) beheaded on the Marquet place at Bruxels, on the returne of such aduertissements as I had sent unto the State? His sen∣tence in Dutch, bearing the vvords, Vitz. For hauing giuen aduertiss∣ments to a publike ministers of a Neigbour Prince. All vvhich being become publix, the COTTINTONIENS ceassed not to countenance instances done for my recall from that Residency; vvhich the Marquis de Velad and Don Alonzo de C∣denas did vigourously persue, though his Maiestie did most graciously reject their motions, and vvith matkes of extraordi∣nary exteeme of my fidelity, for he answ wared, it vvas not his cu∣stome to disgrace those that dit serue him vvill Like ill VVillers as the COTTINTONIENS did likvvelse countenance many complaints against mee made by factio∣nals about Queene Mother. The Duke d'Elboeuf, and others vvho vvould passe into England against his Majesties vvill, vvhen the vvords of my Instuctions (signed by the Lord Dorchester, then Secretary of State) dit beare, that my  vvas in the Scale if any one of those dit passe to trouble the English Seas. As it seemed to be indeed vvhich vvay it vvent, since the factionaris about Queene Mother had those in the English Court, as vvell of the French of the Spanish faction (and of others God knovvith) vvllo did sturre an inteconciliable hattered against me for hindering so great a Princesse as Queene Mother, to repaire in time vvhere shee might breath (att rest) the last of her dayes: In fine it proved that to free Queene Mother from such aduertissements as I could and did giue from the place of my Residency  factionaris a∣bout her ledd her avvay about into Holland, vvhore my con∣fractor Sir Vvilliam Bosvvell could not stop her, though no ruine fell on him for her said passage into England, vvhere selfe being returned I met a Sea of ill  of diuers factions, vvho duting my Eleuen yeares Residency at Bruxels, had taken occasion to except against my aduertissements vvhich spared none, nor of Church, nor State, for vvhat vvas manife∣sted to me and by mee found true on the place I did plainely set dovvn, vvithout mincing any thing for feare of  nor for allurements, resolved to take things as God evould have
, and to make due exteeme of the vvise saying▪ Nolite cansidere Principibus, neque filiis hominum in quibus non est Salus. His Majesty in∣deed vvas often graciously pleased to approve my endeaviours, to ex∣presse his satisfaction thereon, and I may say, (vvithout vanity) a truth, as a marke of my gratitude, that his Majesty vvas so gracious, as to say in publike, that of all those that did then attend His service abroad none vvas more diligent; this vvas vvritten to me by my predecessor Sir Iohn Finet, vvho attended the King at His dinner, vvhen the vvords vvere uttered. Nor could I thinke so meanly of my indeavours, blessed by Gods assi∣stāce in the discovery of many things, vvhich peradventure divers others vvould haue bin incapable off for vvant of Languages, but that I might have bin thought vvorthy of a better revvard; & better considered euen by the best friends of the State of England, since diuers of my adver∣tissements to His Majesties principall Secretaries of State, did beare particulars vvhereby his best friends could be vvarned to looke to themselves, vvhen foure hundred thousand Crounes vvere disposed for the betraying of Mastricht, that engins vvere prepared against Begop∣zom. That one Triboulet, a Bourguinnon, vvas dispatct from Braban to kill the French King Louis the XIII. All I got for my paines vvas a check from old Secretary Coke; to have named in my publike dis∣patch the Duke of Bullon, though his name and the thing became aftervvards publique in the streets of Bruxels, the check, I , vvas not old Sir Iohn Coke, but came from the English Spanish fa∣ction, vvho then constrained Sir Iohn Cokes pen to vvritte as they vvould have it. On the second, the man being discovered by the French King himselfe, a Gentleman belonging to the Duke de Chevreule vvas ent to me, vvith thankes, nor did I looke for more since vvhat I could deserve vvas to put on that masters score, vvho I had the honor to serve. And vvho in conclusion vvas so gracious to mee as to con∣firme his satisfaction of my seruice in my letter of credence to the late French King, by the vvords, Vz. I Do RECOMMEND THIS GEN∣TLEMAN MASTER OF MY CEREMONIES TO YOUR PARTICULAR PROTECTION, FOR THAT HE HATH DONE MEE LONG AND FAITH∣FULL SERVICE. This Letter of Credence I sued for, vvhen I vvas persuaded that I could no longer breath vvhere the Cottintoniens had any credit, since I did feele the continuance of their ill offices vvithout intermission
That it vvas most knavvishly susteined to the King that I had de∣ved to be heinged by my legs, for having to the Lords in Parliament (vvhen I vvas charged by them of my Consience) declared the names of those that did bettray the Kings affaires in forraine parts, though God knovveth I said no more then I could prove, and did but ansvver to the Question, for I never tutcht the string of others, and vvhose rest It vvas not my designe since to trouble; though my Iournals did beare vvhose Pensionnaries they vvere reputed to be, & vvhat Popish Priests vvere theirs. That it vvas likevvise most knavishly represented to the King (vvhen the Prince Elector Palatin to the hearing of Colonell Linzey vvas pleased at Yorckere the Standart vvas let up to request for my Licence, that I might be dismist of my Office to shift for my selfe in some other part of the vvorld) That I had been untrue to my first master the Duke of Buckingham, and this on a most bace, ridiculous and false pretence. VVhich no doubt vvas forstalled by a person, vvho in the Duke of Bukinghams time vvould once put me ill vvith the said Duke, and even at the same instant that he intreated me to get him preferred to a more neere attendance to his person, it vvas one Master Iohn Asbornham, since one of the grooms of the Bedchambre, it vvas for him I spake, the Lady Duchesse (at his earnest sute) required me to do it; I did it in her presence, that she vvas a bed vvith the Duke, vvho mistooke my speech and distickt it, for novv I ust declare the truth (on vvhich I take God to vvitnes) it vvas vvhen the Duke had told me in private that he vvould have me in that place, Sir Sackville Crovv being then on point to be preferred to the place of Tresorier of the Navy. This office in favour of Master Asbornham, though to my one prejudice then, proved so little advantagious to me, as that it vvas supposed to the Duke of Buckingham that I had taken the Lady Porbecks part, to save her from the Officiers that vvould have carried her to prison, from a house in the Strand next to the Vene∣tian Ordinary, vvere then the Savoye Ambassador did lay, and vvhere by accident I then vvas. It being in those dayes that the misunder∣standing betvven the Duke and me vvas fomented, God of Heaven knovveth (to vvhose Tribunall I do appeale on that subject and to ansvver for all vvhat is contained in these Lines) that I had no to-respondence at all vvith the Lady Porbeck, nor bad seen her since the dayes that she lived in amity vvith the Duke and all the family of the Villiers. Not had the Abot d'Escaille any premeditated dessigne
vvith her, nor to contribute to her escappe; as vvas supposed on a vvanton -Loosnesse, vvhich vvas acted on a sud∣dayne, vvithout any premeditation vvhen one of the Pages of the Ambassador vvas drest in a vvon as close Monsieur Bron, Sir Theo∣dor Mayetnes brother in Lavv being then present and the said Page put in a Coach by the Abott d'Esrailles men, vvho finding the house vvhere the Abott d'Escaillie their Master lay to bee abused by a number of men that brake in to g ouer a pall of his guarden into a next house, vvhere the Lady Pobech vvas said to Lodge, proposed to the Abott (being att dinner) to ridde his house of annoyance, for that his said men did conceaue that all the crevv vvould runne out of dores to stopp the Coach vvherein the Page vvas putt, vvho vvas found to be a Page in effect, as foone the Coach vvas overtaken the length of a street, vvhich did not att all contribute to the escappe of the Lady Pobeck, since the house vvherein she vvas remayned pocect vvith Sergeants and store of people. All vvhich being examined and found true moed the Duke of Buckingham to reconcile himselfe vvith the Abott d'Escaille, and to desire that the feast of reconcilliation should be att my house; vvhere the Duke vvas pleased tvvo dayes after to beseech his Maiesties to come vvith the Quene, to accept like entertainment because the manner thereof vvas pleasing. The imposture, therfore, that I should haue been untrue to the Duke being Manifest, could not butt vvith tvvo much Audacity and busnesse be represented to the Kings most Royal  tvvelue yeares after that it vvas clereed, and his Majestie had many proofes of my fidellity and constancy to his seruice, for vvhich I haue many letters of his Royall hand to shue, and vvherein as before said his Majesties hath ben most gratiously pleased to expresse his satisfaction. I vvas thus contayned to sue for my remoue from the presence of a greate King, in vvhose seruice and in that of the State) I vvould haue thought my selfe happy to end my dayes; yett my licence vvas refused to agreate Prince; vvho (in meere compassion) inclined to speake in my favour, vvhen all meanes of subsistance vvere taken from me, that the Secretary of State then Lord Fackland had hin∣dered some Bishops of paying such monnie to mee as had beene by Tallies struck on them a yeare before, and for vvhich I had
payed the fees in the Exchequer att vvestminster. Being thus in an Instant deprived of all lively-hood and also frustrated of desbossments made both for the transpottation of Queene Mothers trayne from London to Douer, and during the time of my attendance in the office of Master of Ceremonies (after I had consumed my selfe in his Maiesties seruice during my eleven yeares Residency in the Court of Bruxels▪ greate part of my arreares being  payed) No vvouder that I tooke then hold on the occa∣sion to passe into France, vvhen I had obtained the letter of Cre∣dence as aforesaid▪ vvhich being about the time that a question vvas moved on as intercepted letter sent from London to Oxford fathe∣red on me (though no man could proure the caracter to be myne not to haue his sent directly nor indirectly by me my said depar∣ture then did not (as it seemes) satisfy all those that heard of the said letter; not some that haue bin pleased to vent glosses theron; Though, I had to pleade on that subiect first, not guilty: Secondly, That I vvas charged vvith a letter of Credence to passe a Compliment vvith a King vvho vvas acere the Angonies of death, as it proued; since ere I landed att Callis he vvas deceassed. Thirdly, that I had a passe from the Parliament, declaring my liber∣tie, to attend his Maiesties seruice, and this vvithout limitation of place; vvhen his Maiestie had full povver on me to command mee to go or to come; That my dependency vvas Manifest and publike; my attendance but a Coremoniall part, vvithout any relation to the dicipline of vvarres. Fourthly  my going from London I vvas in no constraint nor vnder any guarde. Fiftly, it vvas ten the ClocK in the morning vvhen I did embarke my selfe in the ordinary packett boate att Douer vvhereof one Ma∣ster VVhi vvas master vvho had Knovvne me many yeares before, I payed the duties, vvhich the Officers there demanded of mee: all men that vvere there did see my face, vvhich vvas not disguised by falce heare nor peruix. Master vvhit vvas at the starren of the Boate and I neuer vvent under deck to hidde my selfe. Sixtly, that iff the letter could haue been proved to bee mine, yet could it not have argued mee to bee a dangerous man, since I had no voyce in chapter vvith either parties; that I vvas no instrument of the unhappy difference betvven the King and his People for vvhich
I shall praise God vvhille I live; and dirs of my publick dispatchs (vvhich I have made to the King and State during my Residency at Bru∣xels, as my Iournals can manifest) vvill prouve that I did faith∣fully relate hovv little the vvorld did reflect on His Majesties povver, so long it vvas not seasoned by an Harmonious concordance of Par∣liaments; VVhich vvas often cast in my teeth, VVhen I did incist (as my duty vvas, and my Instructions did beare) on the point of the restitution of the Palatinat; VVhich endeauours (besides the pursu∣ance of His Majesties interests) lost me vvith some of the Spanish Mi∣nisters, as namely vvith the President Role, vvho vvhen I did demand Iustice for His Majesties subjests, and such possitiue ansvvers as I vvas commanded to put to him insolently questioned vvhetber the King had an Army of fifthy thousand man at his back: VVhich he eered vvith disrespectfull VVords, vvheron I made a just complaint to the In∣fant Cardinall, vvho did blame the said President Rose for it. No men vvill vvonder (as I do conceiue) that I did at last sue for my recall from that imploiment; as I did vvhen I had so long vvith∣stood the violence and malice of the Cottintoniens, vvho by these great Intelligence vvith the most depraued Ministers the King of Spaine had (some of vvhich the said King hath been constrained to shake of) all the good and solid Orders sent to me by His Majesties Principall Se∣cretaries of State, vvere of no force; and all good indeavours destroyed▪ to the prejudice of His Majesties Seruice, Honour, and the reall good and greatnesse  the State of England. No vvonder also, that I did sue for my said recall, vvhen the Kings ennemies made use of Spirits of Dilion to attempt on the Soules and minds of the first of my family, a perfecution vvhich (vvithout comparaison) Iob neuer felt, for his calamity did not follovv him from one Countrey to another: As sirst it begun against me in Brabant▪ It continued at my returne in England, and follovved me into France, as feemes to finish vvhere it begun vvith my Predecessors. For no sooner had I gotten in France a Surintendance of an Of∣fice vvhich vvould haue proued vvorth to me many thousand pounds a yeare; but vvas pursued by factionnaries, vvho did boldly main∣taine in Petitions presented by the Bishop du Puis to the Queen Re∣gent, that She vvas Ipso facto excommunicated, for having conferred such an Office on an Heretique, as they terme all that are not of the Church of Rome: This vvas pursued by libels and mischie
contrivances; in vvhich English Papists had part, as especially those vvho impudently, and most falcoly, did sustaine me to be the man who crost all the King of great Brittains affaires abroad, alledging other ground for their utterances, but vvhat I had openly declared to the Lords in Parliament concerning the Lord Cottington; and ha during my being at Paris, one Sir Thomas Dishington had free ac∣cesse to me That the said Sir Thomas Dishingt on should have said that it vvas I vvho disuaded the Queen Regent from sending any Ambassador into England that had not left a good esteeme there; that the Queen Regent, being graciously pleased to aske my opinion vvhat per∣son seemed most fit for that Ambassage, I said in ansvver (to her most gracious commands) that to me the Mareshall de Bassompiee see∣meed the fittest, being a peaceable, graue; good, and vvise noble man, vvho hauing once reconciled the tvvo Nations, might perhaps prou a fit Minister for the reconciliation betvveen the King and his people. That the said Sir, Thomas Dishington had said, that the Lord Lan∣thian had departed as ill satisfied from the French Court as any man euer could; If I had not represented to the Queene Regent, and to the Cardinall Mazarin the true condition of that Lord; That I had likevvise procured a present of a golden chaine to the said Sir Thomas Dishington, and presented him to the Cardinall Mazarin, before his going for England, vvhich vvas in the yeare one thousand six hundreth fourty foure. VVeake Objections indeed, and vveake grounds for Master VVil∣liam Crafts to proceede on, for the utter destruction of my familly, and to take hold on any other occasion to do me mischief, as vvas intended vvith a report that I had since my being in France cores∣pounded vvith some that are not in good intelligence vvith the French: On vvhich point I vvas not bound to ansvver to any man liuing, for as I am a free man borne in Zeeland. It vvas free to me (being not ingaged in any seruice to correspond vvith vvhom I vvould) Yes cannot any man doubt of my Integrity, and Maxime considering the profession I haue made during many yeares, my ex∣perience and the cruell persecutions vvhich I have suffered by those that are no reall friends to the State of England, vvith vvhome I vvould correspond (both in publique and priuate) if thereby I could doe good to the said State; because I and my familly haue liued there thirty yeares; that I am of the same Religion that the Church
of England doth professe; and that I haue a particullar affection to the Nation. For the bruited correspondence in it selfe, vvho, doth it concerne? IT may concerne the satisfaction of thse that haue  this (if they please to confirme themselues in vvhat I do maintaine vvhich is TO TELL TRVTH,) to take the paines to reade the copie of a letter vvhich  vvritten so me, at my going from Paris, vvhere I haue novv these nine months, troubled my about recouering three of my daughters, as yet detained from me in a Nunnery; contrary to the Lavves of God, of Nature, the Fundamentall Lavves of the Land; and of Nations in the sight of a most Christian Queens Regent; vvho as Her pious exemplary life, manifests Her to bee a machelesse Miror to all those of Her See, and condition)  disobedience of Children Patents, &c▪ COPIE AND TRVE TRANSLATION OF A LETTER VVRITTEN TO ME BY IAQUES D'ELDIMS, dvvelling in the street S▪ Leu behind La Rue Ours, a Vnneger house, dated 4 Apprill 1646, Puril.

And a by so doing, he vvill free himselfe of that just censvver vvhich those deserve that judge arnisse, so vvill he (by the reading of the fol∣lovving lines) be throughly informed of the just cause that justly mo∣ved me thereunto, and that I could not (vvithout proving criminall to my selfe) obmit to mention the passages contained in the former lines▪ For an Anatomist cannot proceed to the demonstration of the figure of the heart of man except he rips up the skin of the body. Some kings and Princes (vvho are abused by pernicious) Coun∣cellors) vvill not stick to the Obseruation of the Lavvs vvhich they themselues haue made, not to those to vvhich they vvere svvorne, Butt abandonne them selues unto a Licenciousnesse to dispose of the Liues and pocessions of men: But none of them can dispose of the motions of the heart, nor of any mans good fame. Iff theire be any peculliar Prerogatiue in this vvorld sure selfe defence in the least questionnable, it is the first Lavv of nature. The∣refore all men are bound to conclude that those vvho do vvilfully assaille it do make them selffe unvvoorthy of the benefist of the Lavvs of God, the Lavvs of Nature, the fondamentall Lavvs of Empi∣res, and of Nations. To the heart I haue been vvounded, and attempts haue been made to my soule, and therefore no vvonder that I haue begunne these Lines vvith the names of my Parents, their birth, and their
profession, likvveise vvith my birth, and profession; and consequent∣ly vvith some passages that must argue vvhat I haue profest, vvhiest in effet is the ripping upp of the first skin: On vvhich Spirist of Darknesse and Diluzion haue of late endeauioured to put such an infamous stayne, as neither Antiquity nor Moderne times can afforde amorē horride example. All vvhich the said Spirits of Darxnesse factionnaris and adhe∣rents to Cottintoniens haue been contracted in the persson of Mr. VVilliam Crafts, vvho undertooke his taske, to pocesse divers Noble Famillies in Paris, vvith a most false opinion that my Daughters (detained from m in the Nunnery) belong to others: This the Eldest hath declared under her ovvn hand, and that vvhen the said abomi∣nable false-hood vvas uttered by the said Master Craft, shee desired a friend to reprove him, he ansvvered it vvas to make her a fortune. A fortune indeed, vvhich the most vvicked among the Headens vvould on such condition reject, and vvould for ever banish the vvord Fortune from their remembrance. My selfe and a vertuous Mother proclamed the Keepers of these Children, to have spent their meanes, belonging to others, horride Monsters, that kept children from endeavouring their Salvation; and in conclusion by the said Master Craft's most false relations) become in the Opinion of number of Deluded persons a Monster, that should haue been capable to do that for vvhich I should justly deserve to be forsaken by God, and abhorred of all man-kinde; better had I never been borne, than to be coupable of such a crime; better had I lived all my dayes among brute beasts, and not in sight of the Courts of Princes. My life hath been vvithout staine, no man ever savv me pocest vvith vvine, and sure no man can say that the place of my birth vvas destroyed by fire and Brimstone, and that I vvas driven vvith my fa∣mily in a Cave: No man can say of mee (as the VVorld hath just cause to maintaine of the said Master Crafts) to haue svvarued from the Religion in vvhich I baue been borne and bredd, nor for any vvorldly preferments; Meanes to vveake to vvork on a Christian set∣led mnde; I shall rather chouse to abandonne the Society of man∣kind,
all vvorldly conforts; Nay, burry my selfe alive, than to yeeld to disordinate povvers; And had it not been the hopes to do some good on my poore seduced Children, I vvould not haue been mo∣ved neither by promises of SUFFICIENT ENTERTAINMENT ansvverable to my condition, nor by assurances of Royall favours, subscribed by Eminent Signatures, vvhich Monsieur Brasset the French Resident at the Haghe did peruse ere I vould sturre from thence in August last 1645 to returne into France. VVhere (as said before) all my labours on my seduced Children haue proued like the vvashing of Black mores, my cares and paynes having produced to me but some letters vvritten by those blinded Virgins, but penned by their blind Leaders, for so theire arguments proues them to be, since they haue sett under theire one hand that they could not hazard to imitatte Ioseph vvhen he rane to his fa∣ther Iacob to gossen to do theire last duty, but vvith hazard off theire SALVATION, and therefore sent only to me (at my departure) a vvorke Stilled, DISCOVRSE OF AMABLE BOVRZET, a Priest, vvho had dedicated a pack of mouldy or∣dinary tailles, (a nest of Cob-vvebs) to Prince Edvvard Palatin, Allas deluded Prince! as iff those Lines vvere to proue as fatall as the vvound Achiles receaued in his heele, and (though vvhithout comparaison of quality) consequently to stay me, that I might be vvraught uppon, or constrayned to render my Soule into the snarres of Monsieur Bourzet, vvho teacheth a most damnable doctrine, as di∣sobedience of Children to Parents, especially in things in different; vvhich is to see and to heare Parents in a neuther place, according the Lavvs of the Land, VVhich do ordaine children to see and con∣sulte their parents ere they take any religious orders. All vvhich being finally seconded by the letter vvritten by Iacques d'Eldime (vvho dvvels as said before at a Vinnegar man behind Saint Leu, La Rue aux Ours in Paris) proued a most brutish farvvell; and a souer comfort, to the vvounded heart of a Father▪ BALTAZAR GERBIER.
